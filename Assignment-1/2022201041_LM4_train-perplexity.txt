chapter i . : 41.82719015884394
it is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife . : 15.760903025704733
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters . : 10.631071579954108
" my dear mr . : 29.141782711741083
bennet ," said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that netherfield park is let at last ?" mr . : 10.364622817991746
bennet replied that he had not . : 36.29702401086187
" but it is ," returned she ; " for mrs . : 15.786104715877785
long has just been here , and she told me all about it ." mr . : 14.307781193347633
bennet made no answer . : 26.218548896464153
" do not you want to know who has taken it ?" cried his wife impatiently . : 16.902582153497097
" _you_ want to tell me , and i have no objection to hearing it ." this was invitation enough . : 15.324450600919567
" why , my dear , you must know , mrs . : 18.495903345223557
long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england ; that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr . : 9.675416848253256
single , my dear , to be sure ! : 20.369788196298245
a single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year . : 10.133484946263398
what a fine thing for our girls !" " how so ? : 16.273500049735944
how can it affect them ?" " my dear mr . : 13.476198902073941
bennet ," replied his wife , " how can you be so tiresome ! : 17.582666516102883
you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them ." " is that his design in settling here ?" " design ! : 15.210733573054181
nonsense , how can you talk so ! : 14.620765289806782
but it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes ." " i see no occasion for that . : 12.871830986733658
you and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , mr . : 15.729351185179377
bingley might like you the best of the party ." " my dear , you flatter me . : 15.873290652718497
i certainly _have_ had my share of beauty , but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now . : 13.894608532667528
when a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty ." " in such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of ." " but , my dear , you must indeed go and see mr . : 11.44667655709688
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them . : 15.553023923982055
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers . : 9.514118894038285
i dare say mr . : 26.158393511010228
lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane , nor half so good humoured as lydia . : 14.125987578595955
but you are always giving _her_ the preference ." " they have none of them much to recommend them ," replied he ; " they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters ." " mr . : 9.842422144278538
bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ? : 14.603041995693001
i have a high respect for your nerves . : 21.019099969754947
they are my old friends . : 19.91060196746053
i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least ." " ah ! : 11.425904173008549
you do not know what i suffer ." " but i hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood ." " it will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them ." " depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , i will visit them all ." mr . : 11.080617801254405
bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character . : 8.778695845245124
_her_ mind was less difficult to develope . : 13.469585629431013
she was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper . : 15.656688787844859
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous . : 13.93200770385837
the business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its solace was visiting and news . : 12.50588144664946
chapter ii . : 36.386558963427106
bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr . : 11.384828662032037
bingley . : 105.794776539654
it was then disclosed in the following manner . : 26.15999600453539
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " i hope mr . : 8.897873713317082
bingley will like it lizzy ." " we are not in a way to know _what_ mr . : 17.70205431859977
bingley likes ," said her mother resentfully , " since we are not to visit ." " but you forget , mama ," said elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that mrs . : 14.029209976594702
long has promised to introduce him ." " i do not believe mrs . : 12.523029577368577
long will do any such thing . : 22.577855115183016
she has two nieces of her own . : 29.929094380446088
bennet ; " and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you ." mrs . : 16.015566186715468
bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters . : 15.54069033986907
have a little compassion on my nerves . : 21.83237385400636
you tear them to pieces ." " kitty has no discretion in her coughs ," said her father ; " she times them ill ." " i do not cough for my own amusement ," replied kitty fretfully . : 11.276808161820018
" when is your next ball to be , lizzy ?" " to - morrow fortnight ." " aye , so it is ," cried her mother , " and mrs . : 15.79446602219496
long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself ." " then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce mr . : 16.92488982280081
bingley to _her_ ." " impossible , mr . : 20.24868333369401
a fortnight ' s acquaintance is certainly very little . : 24.00752944416085
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . : 22.974649687414086
but if _we_ do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , mrs . : 13.273307400125022
long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , i will take it on myself ." the girls stared at their father . : 12.201329608037756
bennet said only , " nonsense , nonsense !" " what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ?" cried he . : 13.783949110783388
" do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ? : 14.460340944924779
i cannot quite agree with you _there_ . : 21.357813006902543
what say you , mary ? : 46.798385028921956
for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know , and read great books , and make extracts ." mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how . : 12.201028738782018
" while mary is adjusting her ideas ," he continued , " let us return to mr . : 10.206743497006645
bingley ." " i am sick of mr . : 19.413812387785903
bingley ," cried his wife . : 29.297888564064348
" i am sorry to hear _that_ ; but why did not you tell me so before ? : 17.162805099587366
if i had known as much this morning , i certainly would not have called on him . : 18.399799278644185
it is very unlucky ; but as i have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now ." the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of mrs . : 12.498508633984915
bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while . : 13.071598604976131
bennet ! : 276.54984159264797
but i knew i should persuade you at last . : 24.367719533204273
i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . : 11.201232358297935
well , how pleased i am ! : 36.86300338056801
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now ." " now , kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse ," said mr . : 12.240965023997308
bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . : 20.003098349432943
" what an excellent father you have , girls ," said she , when the door was shut . : 14.854769012109145
" i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter . : 13.161479110726036
at our time of life , it is not so pleasant i can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing . : 14.313600616168042
lydia , my love , though you _are_ the youngest , i dare say mr . : 12.755080453896106
bingley will dance with you at the next ball ." " oh !" said lydia stoutly , " i am not afraid ; for though i _am_ the youngest , i ' m the tallest ." the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr . : 8.865033926281782
bennet ' s visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner . : 19.191923821233335
chapter iii . : 36.386558963427106
not all that mrs . : 51.79412235210177
bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr . : 10.958954094424273
they attacked him in various ways ; with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises ; but he eluded the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second - hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas . : 8.927771054738425
her report was highly favourable . : 28.423427352707066
sir william had been delighted with him . : 23.84108998915181
he was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party . : 13.040300492147747
to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of mr . : 12.537609954489945
bingley ' s heart were entertained . : 16.961024967618002
bennet to her husband , " and all the others equally well married , i shall have nothing to wish for ." in a few days mr . : 17.438375875634392
bingley returned mr . : 36.99647385791522
bennet ' s visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library . : 18.17129322731221
he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father . : 13.53035089340049
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had mrs . : 15.253119025813863
bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all . : 10.924178989333578
bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , & c . : 14.048830330278761
bennet was quite disconcerted . : 33.866601258631846
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that mr . : 9.816559642691134
bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly . : 14.917784740037852
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from london , his five sisters and a cousin . : 12.19119739304976
bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man . : 26.592047460873175
bingley was good looking and gentleman - like ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners . : 11.517183824209006
his sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion . : 11.455925069413814
his brother - in - law , mr . : 11.8226343216861
darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien ; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year . : 9.439465773132795
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr . : 16.67431553381373
bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . : 10.185236642299948
such amiable qualities must speak for themselves . : 15.401166200475215
what a contrast between him and his friend ! : 22.62698341891054
hurst and once with miss bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party . : 10.668541480002919
his character was decided . : 32.319432912870525
amongst the most violent against him was mrs . : 11.456572313802619
bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters . : 14.376086861938946
elizabeth bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , mr . : 14.273586347703201
darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr . : 11.628977957773754
bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it . : 17.23879714446047
" come , darcy ," said he , " i must have you dance . : 20.221122153356482
i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . : 11.8413048494843
you had much better dance ." " i certainly shall not . : 24.36101079218582
you know how i detest it , unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner . : 18.11222085610618
at such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable . : 21.01403120410285
your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with ." " i would not be so fastidious as you are ," cried bingley , " for a kingdom ! : 15.36310298771201
upon my honour , i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as i have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty ." " _you_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room ," said mr . : 11.59746136066098
darcy , looking at the eldest miss bennet . : 23.872560718574718
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld ! : 19.0703080800949
but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and i dare say , very agreeable . : 16.477330616919467
do let me ask my partner to introduce you ." " which do you mean ?" and turning round , he looked for a moment at elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , " she is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_ ; and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . : 9.3902224625611
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me ." mr . : 12.098886286485685
bingley followed his advice . : 25.038851547790145
darcy walked off ; and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him . : 12.292747152711083
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous . : 12.418838152761323
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family . : 18.01121775717888
bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party . : 15.331917236393224
jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a quieter way . : 22.3958135334016
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball . : 12.618259906219638
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants . : 16.584776894559205
they found mr . : 42.30032353829866
bennet still up . : 41.66799710942385
with a book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations . : 12.606829002630501
my dear mr . : 30.334651658873756
bennet ," as she entered the room , " we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball . : 18.65551625120705
i wish you had been there . : 31.951896388416753
bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice . : 19.161019676973414
only think of _that_ my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . : 14.503459448645199
first of all , he asked miss lucas . : 32.486822101436545
so , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next . : 24.67774379697717
then , the two third he danced with miss king , and the two fourth with maria lucas , and the two fifth with jane again , and the two sixth with lizzy , and the boulanger ----" " if he had had any compassion for _me_ ," cried her husband impatiently , " he would not have danced half so much ! : 10.954378766569308
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance !" " oh ! : 12.805944251343773
my dear ," continued mrs . : 18.981375408935794
and his sisters are charming women . : 22.90284519134447
i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses . : 11.665176042165262
hurst ' s gown ----" here she was interrupted again . : 15.78142429064371
bennet protested against any description of finery . : 13.242073865761167
" but i can assure you ," she added , " that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . : 9.597901009311162
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him ! : 14.171458969468874
not handsome enough to dance with ! : 29.61879052904246
i wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set downs . : 20.171867319928502
bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him . : 16.082252302259732
" he is just what a young man ought to be ," said she , " sensible , good humoured , lively ; and i never saw such happy manners !-- so much ease , with such perfect good breeding !" " he is also handsome ," replied elizabeth , " which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can . : 11.060771410019285
his character is thereby complete ." " i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . : 13.736950671577807
i did not expect such a compliment ." " did not you ? : 27.288789891048328
_i_ did for you . : 23.325820316090294
but that is one great difference between us . : 17.17180334148216
compliments always take _you_ by surprise , and _me_ never . : 11.69028808963331
what could be more natural than his asking you again ? : 17.338904667937882
he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . : 9.650197238197594
no thanks to his gallantry for that . : 28.298447105725646
well , he certainly is very agreeable , and i give you leave to like him . : 20.357170823858716
you have liked many a stupider person ." " dear lizzy !" " oh ! : 13.508190269818746
you are a great deal too apt you know , to like people in general . : 16.43837700308088
you never see a fault in any body . : 20.471427424988093
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes . : 14.911821701721797
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life ." " i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one ; but i always speak what i think ." " i know you do ; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder . : 12.07609540350072
with _your_ good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! : 13.874578081309343
but to be candid without ostentation or design -- to take the good of every body ' s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad -- belongs to you alone . : 11.466362820552538
and so , you like this man ' s sisters too , do you ? : 23.997366022168368
their manners are not equal to his ." " certainly not ; at first . : 20.73777408083985
but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . : 16.89752431091444
they were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited . : 10.682721974838541
they were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others . : 10.10039883401964
they were of a respectable family in the north of england ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother ' s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade . : 10.049573438264899
bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it .-- mr . : 10.421246584021272
bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase . : 11.301598203350116
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was mrs . : 11.334262814769286
hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . : 9.77171890470293
bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house . : 11.20531565719747
he did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately . : 12.459147293426973
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character .-- bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied . : 8.797077653493007
on the strength of darcy ' s regard bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion . : 13.05046201190039
in understanding darcy was the superior . : 38.04795562813757
bingley was by no means deficient , but darcy was clever . : 17.045512930437972
he was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting . : 15.39357352819834
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage . : 17.28315758488652
bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , darcy was continually giving offence . : 10.730704912587028
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic . : 15.109821571088668
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful . : 10.955285925678066
darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure . : 10.289376088579225
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much . : 17.753680865394692
hurst and her sister allowed it to be so -- but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of . : 13.849816188341675
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose . : 13.82747110334524
chapter v . : 36.386558963427106
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate . : 9.986239084217933
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king , during his mayoralty . : 8.983156740362785
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly . : 12.56698731308971
it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton , denominated from that period lucas lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world . : 10.095223566652221
for though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body . : 12.51399945718845
by nature inoffensive , friendly and obliging , his presentation at st . : 8.291796123837209
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs . : 11.731883125642513
the eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty - seven , was elizabeth ' s intimate friend . : 14.522232096925622
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate . : 11.388704458981879
" _you_ began the evening well , charlotte ," said mrs . : 19.73966809663732
bennet with civil self - command to miss lucas . : 14.752780511197289
bingley ' s first choice ." " yes ;-- but he seemed to like his second better ." " oh !-- you mean jane , i suppose -- because he danced with her twice . : 11.569590064681577
to be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her -- indeed i rather believe he _did_ -- i heard something about it -- but i hardly know what -- something about mr . : 8.76722232319652
robinson ." " perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr . : 11.12170907188829
robinson ' s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and _which_ he thought the prettiest ? : 10.723335548093969
and his answering immediately to the last question -- oh ! : 18.293083269254875
the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point ." " upon my word !-- well , that was very decided indeed -- that does seem as if ---- but however , it may all come to nothing you know ." " _my_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_ , eliza ," said charlotte . : 10.317895521749078
" mr . : 60.14937396433244
darcy speaking to her ." " aye -- because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield , and he could not help answering her ;-- but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to ." " miss bingley told me ," said jane , " that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance . : 11.18811637542267
with _them_ he is remarkably agreeable ." " i do not believe a word of it , my dear . : 15.943761141664575
if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs . : 15.757699112438077
but i can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs . : 11.81110450048735
long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise ." " i do not mind his not talking to mrs . : 12.416249830935737
long ," said miss lucas , " but i wish he had danced with eliza ." " another time , lizzy ," said her mother , " i would not dance with _him_ , if i were you ." " i believe , ma ' am , i may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him ." " his pride ," said miss lucas , " does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it . : 10.698356285107609
one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself . : 13.372882395621009
by all that i have ever read , i am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self - complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . : 9.860373002621317
vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonimously . : 8.069927113909515
a person may be proud without being vain . : 21.66847438055255
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us ." " if i were as rich as mr . : 10.188610779904144
i would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day ." " then you would drink a great deal more than you ought ," said mrs . : 9.398227306087104
bennet ; " and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly ." the boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit . : 12.550916115948578
chapter vi . : 36.386558963427106
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield . : 15.413742599705774
miss bennet ' s pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs . : 13.648867111558808
hurst and miss bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ , was expressed towards the two eldest . : 12.724451807097072
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother ' s admiration . : 11.104495029558386
it was generally evident whenever they met , that he _did_ admire her ; and to _her_ it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent . : 12.04763265246483
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas . : 28.163029638428895
" it may perhaps be pleasant ," replied charlotte , " to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded . : 13.904576252150582
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark . : 12.10651715596514
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . : 10.80431941689078
we can all _begin_ freely -- a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement . : 9.404826653254016
in nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels . : 12.42479822277323
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on ." " but she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . : 13.983217548274379
if _i_ can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too ." " remember , eliza , that he does not know jane ' s disposition as you do ." " but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out ." " perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . : 12.94461114428759
but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together . : 9.133420606642028
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention . : 12.909661828800585
when she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses ." " your plan is a good one ," replied elizabeth , " where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if i were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it . : 11.251492363976602
but these are not jane ' s feelings ; she is not acting by design . : 19.50711289053859
as yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness . : 21.318970543847254
she has known him only a fortnight . : 27.359665328341876
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character ." " not as you represent it . : 14.882707409928338
had she merely _dined_ with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together -- and four evenings may do a great deal ." " yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt - un better than commerce ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , i do not imagine that much has been unfolded ." " well ," said charlotte , " i wish jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to - morrow , i should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . : 9.073976510133054
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before - hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least . : 10.851743932027492
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life ." " you make me laugh , charlotte ; but it is not sound . : 10.797812178396843
you know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself ." occupied in observing mr . : 13.220490838883277
bingley ' s attentions to her sister , elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend . : 13.34521793933487
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying . : 14.767643172407961
though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness . : 10.174928387654482
of this she was perfectly unaware ;-- to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with . : 13.714126556130275
his doing so drew her notice . : 17.886399286907142
" what does mr . : 36.75970047327767
darcy mean ," said she to charlotte , " by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ?" " that is a question which mr . : 14.077043340907625
darcy only can answer ." " but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about . : 14.70030865536411
he has a very satirical eye , and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself , i shall soon grow afraid of him ." on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " did not you think , mr . : 11.617558323265527
darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton ?" " with great energy ;-- but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic ." " you are severe on us ." " it will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed ," said miss lucas . : 9.585811355094549
" i am going to open the instrument , eliza , and you know what follows ." " you are a very strange creature by way of a friend !-- always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body !-- if my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers ." on miss lucas ' s persevering , however , she added , " very well ; if it must be so , it must ." and gravely glancing at mr . : 9.45179069832256
darcy , " there is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with --' keep your breath to cool your porridge ,'-- and i shall keep mine to swell my song ." her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital . : 7.123209938097132
after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display . : 11.308964164093563
mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached . : 8.218280937656532
elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room . : 9.164108816562717
darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour , till sir william thus began . : 10.387580947356618
" what a charming amusement for young people this is , mr . : 13.965795913241813
darcy !-- there is nothing like dancing after all .-- i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies ." " certainly , sir ;-- and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world .-- every savage can dance ." sir william only smiled . : 8.519081269678491
" your friend performs delightfully ;" he continued after a pause , on seeing bingley join the group ;--" and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , mr . : 9.231240565629225
darcy ." " you saw me dance at meryton , i believe , sir ." " yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight . : 13.500979432519427
do you often dance at st . : 16.130112820176105
darcy bowed . : 84.76031369760948
darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to sir william , " indeed , sir , i have not the least intention of dancing .-- i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner ." mr . : 11.159568522874064
elizabeth was determined ; nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion . : 10.519672867695911
" you excel so much in the dance , miss eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , i am sure , to oblige us for one half hour ." " mr . : 10.456469515907848
darcy is all politeness ," said elizabeth , smiling . : 19.55678842789269
" he is indeed -- but considering the inducement , my dear miss eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ?" elizabeth looked archly , and turned away . : 11.788323284150067
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by miss bingley , " i can guess the subject of your reverie ." " i should imagine not ." " you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner -- in such society ; and indeed i am quite of your opinion . : 12.110585424184928
the insipidity and yet the noise ; the nothingness and yet the self - importance of all these people !-- what would i give to hear your strictures on them !" " your conjecture is totally wrong , i assure you . : 8.40913340927734
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow ." miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections . : 9.707282784335371
darcy replied with great intrepidity , " miss elizabeth bennet ." " miss elizabeth bennet !" repeated miss bingley . : 13.840811676607148
" i am all astonishment . : 29.52711714550294
how long has she been such a favourite ?-- and pray when am i to wish you joy ?" " that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask . : 10.458430124774868
a lady ' s imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment . : 11.64898927913567
i knew you would be wishing me joy ." " nay , if you are so serious about it , i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled . : 13.191378405389633
you will have a charming mother - in - law , indeed , and of course she will be always at pemberley with you ." he listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed long . : 11.232613550901489
chapter vii . : 36.386558963427106
bennet ' s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in default of heirs male , on a distant relation ; and their mother ' s fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his . : 8.936134235357907
her father had been an attorney in meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds . : 14.034760688781839
she had a sister married to a mr . : 24.112334419658417
philips , who had been a clerk to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade . : 14.558663924247394
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner ' s shop just over the way . : 10.337414039455728
the two youngest of the family , catherine and lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters ', and when nothing better offered , a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt . : 7.753267706408514
at present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and meryton was the head quarters . : 12.563018103124227
their visits to mrs . : 27.018733360713103
philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence . : 16.0045205702134
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers ' names and connections . : 12.453593433180755
their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves . : 17.503011299021164
they could talk of nothing but officers ; and mr . : 17.243350247769886
bingley ' s large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign . : 12.260775662440354
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , mr . : 11.674895689067782
bennet coolly observed , " from all that i can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country . : 15.03662169120641
i have suspected it some time , but i am now convinced ." catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of captain carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to london . : 11.599033317643677
" i am astonished , my dear ," said mrs . : 13.91410437705178
bennet , " that you should be so ready to think your own children silly . : 16.56558354651543
if i wished to think slightingly of any body ' s children , it should not be of my own however ." " if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it ." " yes -- but as it happens , they are all of them very clever ." " this is the only point , i flatter myself , on which we do not agree . : 14.279350409018935
bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother .-- when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do . : 10.809353775785803
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well -- and indeed so i do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , i shall not say nay to him ; and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william ' s in his regimentals ." " mama ," cried lydia , " my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson ' s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in clarke ' s library ." mrs . : 9.190936265380362
bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer . : 11.523896035687201
what is it about ? : 38.37133164784752
what does he say ? : 29.551762186827776
well , jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love ." " it is from miss bingley ," said jane , and then read it aloud . : 13.426175840466966
come as soon as you can on the receipt of this . : 21.62798349632551
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers . : 27.719980992635346
" i wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_ ." " dining out ," said mrs . : 14.990764791410939
bennet , " that is very unlucky ." " can i have the carriage ?" said jane . : 20.103829738456643
" no , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night ." " that would be a good scheme ," said elizabeth , " if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home ." " oh ! : 12.017177364498997
but the gentlemen will have mr . : 28.874060610468682
bingley ' s chaise to go to meryton ; and the hursts have no horses to theirs ." " i had much rather go in the coach ." " but , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , i am sure . : 10.679990186642739
they are wanted in the farm , mr . : 16.381823547897273
bennet , are not they ?" " they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them ." " but if you have got them to - day ," said elizabeth , " my mother ' s purpose will be answered ." she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged . : 12.237923892235296
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day . : 13.796481065029086
her hopes were answered ; jane had not been gone long before it rained hard . : 10.71147853546615
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; jane certainly could not come back . : 13.306737199448117
till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance . : 16.119226632825967
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth : " my dearest lizzy , " i find myself very unwell this morning , which , i suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . : 9.280186073535816
my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better . : 17.558706792171872
they insist also on my seeing mr . : 15.907449984516226
jones -- therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me -- and excepting a sore - throat and head - ache there is not much the matter with me . : 9.491219473123762
" yours , & c ." " well , my dear ," said mr . : 12.902190778895005
bingley , and under your orders ." " oh ! : 17.209230627114348
i am not at all afraid of her dying . : 26.00818482609036
people do not die of little trifling colds . : 14.38824584962915
she will be taken good care of . : 24.475226016344497
as long as she stays there , it is all very well . : 20.584464372131595
i would go and see her , if i could have the carriage ." elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse - woman , walking was her only alternative . : 14.621722448609855
she declared her resolution . : 42.36370222033014
" how can you be so silly ," cried her mother , " as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! : 16.832248114836194
you will not be fit to be seen when you get there ." " i shall be very fit to see jane -- which is all i want ." " is this a hint to me , lizzy ," said her father , " to send for the horses ?" " no , indeed . : 13.322854238333553
i do not wish to avoid the walk . : 22.6862047927372
the distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles . : 16.225982114423992
i shall be back by dinner ." " i admire the activity of your benevolence ," observed mary , " but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required ." " we will go as far as meryton with you ," said catherine and lydia .-- elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together . : 9.345840374145507
" if we make haste ," said lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes ." in meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ' wives , and elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise . : 7.524731581225059
she was shewn into the breakfast - parlour , where all but jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise .-- that she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to mrs . : 11.193797548311718
hurst and miss bingley ; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it . : 12.525481518918122
she was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother ' s manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness .-- mr . : 11.404955499666704
darcy said very little , and mr . : 24.898370730410853
hurst nothing at all . : 22.335303661461328
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast . : 26.825272447388787
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered . : 23.79480588151617
miss bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room . : 15.091374855846025
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance . : 12.8897882258032
she was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when miss bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with . : 12.633977176128901
when breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane . : 13.099588401285095
the apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts . : 12.96372980218609
the advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely . : 13.624604254122264
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere . : 13.35053144510211
when the clock struck three , elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very unwillingly said so . : 14.243859736947359
miss bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when jane testified such concern in parting with her , that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present . : 10.590074595705195
elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes . : 10.205877522858865
chapter viii . : 36.386558963427106
to the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr . : 8.370877083921782
jane was by no means better . : 21.287434961876773
the sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them , restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike . : 9.999251721788154
she had very little notice from any but him . : 16.352644068405617
miss bingley was engrossed by mr . : 16.23819320102754
darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for mr . : 20.257373497013607
hurst , by whom elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her . : 9.587617070472229
when dinner was over , she returned directly to jane , and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room . : 14.583617383190418
hurst thought the same , and added , " she has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . : 19.28604769893269
i shall never forget her appearance this morning . : 15.28725174467409
she really looked almost wild ." " she did indeed , louisa . : 19.450177089958228
i could hardly keep my countenance . : 23.98851682210735
very nonsensical to come at all ! : 33.95210525015593
why must _she_ be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ? : 14.012583009023441
her hair so untidy , so blowsy !" " yes , and her petticoat ; i hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , i am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office ." " your picture may be very exact , louisa ," said bingley ; " but this was all lost upon me . : 9.188196845275966
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning . : 15.295546213983902
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice ." " _you_ observed it , mr . : 11.67920567607166
darcy , i am sure ," said miss bingley ; " and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition ." " certainly not ." " to walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! : 10.745686030926931
what could she mean by it ? : 26.39850656684419
it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum ." " it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing ," said bingley . : 10.814417969500187
" i am afraid , mr . : 17.75170417288744
darcy ," observed miss bingley , in a half whisper , " that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes ." " not at all ," he replied ; " they were brightened by the exercise ."-- a short pause followed this speech , and mrs . : 9.556218805399412
hurst began again . : 26.072350797454984
" i have an excessive regard for jane bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and i wish with all my heart she were well settled . : 13.05472139494369
but with such a father and mother , and such low connections , i am afraid there is no chance of it ." " i think i have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in meryton ." " yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near cheapside ." " that is capital ," added her sister , and they both laughed heartily . : 11.852358424372987
to this speech bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend ' s vulgar relations . : 9.586376356097293
with a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining - parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee . : 11.649742851031423
she was still very poorly , and elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself . : 12.53459574887853
on entering the drawing - room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book . : 10.757723899038117
hurst looked at her with astonishment . : 22.90787416814926
" do you prefer reading to cards ?" said he ; " that is rather singular ." " miss eliza bennet ," said miss bingley , " despises cards . : 10.954895493898073
she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else ." " i deserve neither such praise nor such censure ," cried elizabeth ; " i am _not_ a great reader , and i have pleasure in many things ." " in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure ," said bingley ; " and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well ." elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying . : 9.621954873808743
he immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded . : 14.197600160065948
" and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but i am an idle fellow , and though i have not many , i have more than i ever look into ." elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room . : 10.82014708328327
" i am astonished ," said miss bingley , " that my father should have left so small a collection of books .-- what a delightful library you have at pemberley , mr . : 10.732089618496309
darcy !" " it ought to be good ," he replied , " it has been the work of many generations ." " and then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books ." " i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these ." " neglect ! : 12.227094168119603
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . : 10.654430955618322
charles , when you build _your_ house , i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley ." " i wish it may ." " but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take pemberley for a kind of model . : 10.702835321481759
bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game . : 19.77333740085888
" is miss darcy much grown since the spring ?" said miss bingley ; " will she be as tall as i am ?" " i think she will . : 12.889016077938972
she is now about miss elizabeth bennet ' s height , or rather taller ." " how i long to see her again ! : 13.101744946796652
i never met with anybody who delighted me so much . : 14.809761593070982
such a countenance , such manners ! : 28.329984303701938
and so extremely accomplished for her age ! : 26.976844118756432
her performance on the piano - forte is exquisite ." " it is amazing to me ," said bingley , " how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are ." " all young ladies accomplished ! : 12.638574873923204
my dear charles , what do you mean ?" " yes , all of them , i think . : 16.355898582185294
they all paint tables , cover skreens and net purses . : 6.922512639687833
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished ." " your list of the common extent of accomplishments ," said darcy , " has too much truth . : 11.632878739071762
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse , or covering a skreen . : 8.183994892793207
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general . : 14.47014097958501
i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished ." " nor i , i am sure ," said miss bingley . : 12.424386979811276
" then ," observed elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman ." " yes ; i do comprehend a great deal in it ." " oh ! : 12.726935971529658
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved ." " all this she must possess ," added darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading ." " i am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women . : 9.489308787606104
i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_ ." " are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ?" " _i_ never saw such a woman . : 11.771254928290524
_i_ never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united ." mrs . : 13.521483312785932
hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward . : 11.547672040663477
as all conversation was thereby at an end , elizabeth soon afterwards left the room . : 11.931629265231454
" eliza bennet ," said miss bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , i dare say , it succeeds . : 13.411682461173914
whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable ." miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject . : 8.555659256551184
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her . : 19.941227853566563
bingley urged mr . : 36.27668969435663
this , she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother ' s proposal ; and it was settled that mr . : 13.663932643351442
jones should be sent for early in the morning , if miss bennet were not decidedly better . : 15.724103758621542
bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable . : 16.859806994538374
chapter ix . : 36.386558963427106
bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters . : 17.021657651347315
the note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with . : 15.136746250861238
had she found jane in any apparent danger , mrs . : 14.948545844261067
bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield . : 11.851168977001334
she would not listen therefore to her daughter ' s proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable . : 11.748716191407786
after sitting a little while with jane , on miss bingley ' s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour . : 11.457757020844001
bingley met them with hopes that mrs . : 13.962177691874457
bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected . : 17.690262139742607
" she is a great deal too ill to be moved . : 18.17981827827284
jones says we must not think of moving her . : 12.928710299628154
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness ." " removed !" cried bingley . : 13.46328544951919
" it must not be thought of . : 38.782797116322406
my sister , i am sure , will not hear of her removal ." " you may depend upon it , madam ," said miss bingley , with cold civility , " that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us ." mrs . : 11.662171320168927
bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments . : 22.399657834954525
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_ . : 16.531142119999767
you have a sweet room here , mr . : 18.297843652752704
bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk . : 13.82710348453388
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield . : 17.704331478640377
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope , though you have but a short lease ." " whatever i do is done in a hurry ," replied he ; " and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield , i should probably be off in five minutes . : 12.229091362419494
at present , however , i consider myself as quite fixed here ." " that is exactly what i should have supposed of you ," said elizabeth . : 12.105663580820435
" you begin to comprehend me , do you ?" cried he , turning towards her . : 17.089750608868613
yes -- i understand you perfectly ." " i wish i might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful ." " that is as it happens . : 11.492590685137857
it does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours ." " lizzy ," cried her mother , " remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home ." " i did not know before ," continued bingley immediately , " that you were a studier of character . : 9.886864618443331
it must be an amusing study ." " yes ; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing . : 11.407464494896997
they have at least that advantage ." " the country ," said darcy , " can in general supply but few subjects for such a study . : 12.737214275680923
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society ." " but people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever ." " yes , indeed ," cried mrs . : 9.349235289734994
bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood . : 14.47842584398601
" i assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town ." every body was surprised ; and darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away . : 13.644184904477523
bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph . : 12.157198315669383
" i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the shops and public places . : 7.477154952324118
the country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , mr . : 16.691553997114827
bingley ?" " when i am in the country ," he replied , " i never wish to leave it ; and when i am in town it is pretty much the same . : 17.63315498587448
they have each their advantages , and i can be equally happy in either ." " aye -- that is because you have the right disposition . : 13.92578104439106
" you quite mistook mr . : 23.99002975755008
he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true ." " certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger . : 12.560637432150177
i know we dine with four and twenty families ." nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance . : 9.504490154713647
his sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards mr . : 14.879584947804684
darcy with a very expressive smile . : 31.1851178340436
" yes , she called yesterday with her father . : 25.332813052349326
what an agreeable man sir william is , mr . : 16.240594452028443
bingley -- is not he ? : 35.053497466072855
so much the man of fashion ! : 29.867345723875808
so genteel and so easy !-- he has always something to say to every body .-- _that_ is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter ." " did charlotte dine with you ?" " no , she would go home . : 9.19453433654839
i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies . : 19.282990778599405
for my part , mr . : 21.699037231067372
bingley , _i_ always keep servants that can do their own work ; _my_ daughters are brought up differently . : 7.3596508455566525
but every body is to judge for themselves , and the lucases are very good sort of girls , i assure you . : 16.043841283413833
it is a pity they are not handsome ! : 25.312804002336765
not that _i_ think charlotte so _very_ plain -- but then she is our particular friend ." " she seems a very pleasant young woman ," said bingley . : 9.73872143792882
dear , yes ;-- but you must own she is very plain . : 19.51744877443953
lady lucas herself has often said so , and envied me jane ' s beauty . : 13.651375964803725
i do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , jane -- one does not often see any body better looking . : 13.220566166205233
it is what every body says . : 26.633661114056373
when she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner ' s in town , so much in love with her , that my sister - in - law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away . : 11.091175534121836
perhaps he thought her too young . : 20.459573596939855
however , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were ." " and so ended his affection ," said elizabeth impatiently . : 14.83821833109182
i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love !" " i have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love ," said darcy . : 7.5648928661212285
" of a fine , stout , healthy love it may . : 16.885083102387107
every thing nourishes what is strong already . : 15.264783796067135
but if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away ." darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again . : 7.83555905446903
she longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence mrs . : 16.822334587553403
bennet began repeating her thanks to mr . : 13.508480029076901
bingley for his kindness to jane , with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy . : 11.654687384196329
bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required . : 13.295527782168158
she performed her part indeed without much graciousness , but mrs . : 12.643148992255997
bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage . : 20.54072104779054
upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward . : 14.800825590066896
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax mr . : 14.98815038924516
lydia was a stout , well - grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good - humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age . : 8.664163834487207
she had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self - consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle ' s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance . : 11.934085655757015
she was very equal therefore to address mr . : 13.819159753011386
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother ' s ear . : 13.974819938073884
" i am perfectly ready , i assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball . : 14.287254287080032
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill ." lydia declared herself satisfied . : 14.754020498743033
yes -- it would be much better to wait till jane was well , and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again . : 11.7469392878233
and when you have given _your_ ball ," she added , " i shall insist on their giving one also . : 11.269070911176303
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not ." mrs . : 12.956510039124966
chapter x . : 36.386558963427106
the day passed much as the day before had done . : 24.221642262420616
hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing - room . : 11.900672232975166
the loo table , however , did not appear . : 30.24246754651971
darcy was writing , and miss bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister . : 11.476771468094709
bingley were at piquet , and mrs . : 22.13305489754289
hurst was observing their game . : 12.962043953694744
elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion . : 11.84458044839452
" you write uncommonly fast ." " you are mistaken . : 16.187935590512165
i write rather slowly ." " how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year ! : 15.03608192133249
letters of business too ! : 18.05713615187879
how odious i should think them !" " it is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours ." " pray tell your sister that i long to see her ." " i have already told her so once , by your desire ." " i am afraid you do not like your pen . : 10.555605387707946
i mend pens remarkably well ." " thank you -- but i always mend my own ." " how can you contrive to write so even ?" he was silent . : 11.605452272254428
" tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley ' s ." " will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again ?-- at present i have not room to do them justice ." " oh ! : 10.441831498224387
it is of no consequence . : 30.37092050828438
i shall see her in january . : 34.38537701714413
but do you always write such charming long letters to her , mr . : 12.276167105965019
darcy ?" " they are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine ." " it is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill ." " that will not do for a compliment to darcy , caroline ," cried her brother --" because he does _not_ write with ease . : 10.988019026969015
he studies too much for words of four syllables .-- do not you , darcy ?" " my style of writing is very different from yours ." " oh !" cried miss bingley , " charles writes in the most careless way imaginable . : 10.232891720696866
he leaves out half his words , and blots the rest ." " my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them -- by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents ." " your humility , mr . : 7.958995546143012
bingley ," said elizabeth , " must disarm reproof ." " nothing is more deceitful ," said darcy , " than the appearance of humility . : 12.458371031146307
it is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast ." " and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty ?" " the indirect boast ;-- for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting . : 8.352776784103233
the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance . : 13.204211394245629
when you told mrs . : 24.095058514588423
bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself -- and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ?" " nay ," cried bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning . : 10.667461030458435
and yet , upon my honour , i believed what i said of myself to be true , and i believe it at this moment . : 19.283393638982787
at least , therefore , i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies ." " i dare say you believed it ; but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity . : 10.398254281555324
your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know ; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , ' bingley , you had better stay till next week ,' you would probably do it , you would probably not go -- and , at another word , might stay a month ." " you have only proved by this ," cried elizabeth , " that mr . : 10.941843297012323
bingley did not do justice to his own disposition . : 25.142283785898556
you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself ." " i am exceedingly gratified ," said bingley , " by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper . : 10.695928187891615
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as i could ." " would mr . : 10.422465340302919
darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ?" " upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter , darcy must speak for himself ." " you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which i have never acknowledged . : 7.912703052282819
allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , miss bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety ." " to yield readily -- easily -- to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you ." " to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either ." " you appear to me , mr . : 9.32434088545873
darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection . : 16.528895169427244
a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it . : 8.631013896322175
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr . : 14.943998927378502
we may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon . : 9.62263410886155
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ?" " will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ?" " by all means ," cried bingley ; " let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , miss bennet , than you may be aware of . : 9.129795399263367
i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , i should not pay him half so much deference . : 13.085494679586272
darcy smiled ; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh . : 16.195428992553367
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense . : 10.428964392569817
arguments are too much like disputes . : 13.962875669595263
darcy had much better finish his letter ." mr . : 14.385334505048165
darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter . : 19.1780167321284
when that business was over , he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music . : 18.187535219720896
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano - forte , and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself . : 9.577124171979088
hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently mr . : 9.655477977358427
darcy ' s eyes were fixed on her . : 17.14521115042402
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange . : 13.10636311108771
she could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present . : 8.956592223940337
the supposition did not pain her . : 35.337462547594015
she liked him too little to care for his approbation . : 20.023105077854822
he repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence . : 21.776144099585224
" oh !" said she , " i heard you before ; but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply . : 14.953205425102224
i have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that i do not want to dance a reel at all -- and now despise me if you dare ." " indeed i do not dare ." elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her . : 11.154496590920822
he really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger . : 24.426869281705233
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance . : 11.625945976124374
" i hope ," said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , " you will give your mother - in - law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after the officers .-- and , if i may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses ." " have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ?" " oh ! : 8.538356259299192
yes .-- do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley . : 10.153734150748225
put them next to your great uncle the judge . : 12.090994495062974
they are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lines . : 14.79665319170584
as for your elizabeth ' s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ?" " it would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye - lashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied ." at that moment they were met from another walk , by mrs . : 9.66256026554272
hurst and elizabeth herself . : 37.87277514207805
" i did not know that you intended to walk ," said miss bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard . : 15.99942452472038
hurst , " in running away without telling us that you were coming out ." then taking the disengaged arm of mr . : 8.012066732444517
darcy , she left elizabeth to walk by herself . : 20.165603319484852
the path just admitted three . : 25.20985229248552
darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said ,-- " this walk is not wide enough for our party . : 9.770794116473141
we had better go into the avenue ." but elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , " no , no ; stay where you are .-- you are charmingly group ' d , and appear to uncommon advantage . : 10.404058895405912
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth . : 14.356327991074723
good bye ." she then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two . : 12.087601381770705
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening . : 9.937884905368882
when the ladies removed after dinner , elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing - room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared . : 9.628791616410616
their powers of conversation were considerable . : 17.641270941425542
they could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit . : 7.815801970291397
but when the gentlemen entered , jane was no longer the first object . : 21.585862140820666
miss bingley ' s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps . : 13.86799395058235
hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad ;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley ' s salutation . : 10.052216623696966
he was full of joy and attention . : 17.91184942871798
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire - place , that she might be farther from the door . : 11.323777251021825
he then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else . : 20.723007072269237
when tea was over , mr . : 17.425196387935486
she had obtained private intelligence that mr . : 12.8935368397417
darcy did not wish for cards ; and mr . : 22.891577015037154
hurst soon found even his open petition rejected . : 8.700377771914013
she assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her . : 15.419315587832012
hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep . : 11.599838892832556
darcy took up a book ; miss bingley did the same ; and mrs . : 16.176402003792653
hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother ' s conversation with miss bennet . : 9.289397627437127
miss bingley ' s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr . : 12.755490854144753
darcy ' s progress through _his_ book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page . : 11.169916450021502
she could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on . : 15.767565192126327
at length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , " how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! : 13.893874335289683
i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! : 15.372766429467926
how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book !-- when i have a house of my own , i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library ." no one made any reply . : 11.277035555374608
she then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , " by the bye , charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield ?-- i would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure ." " if you mean darcy ," cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins -- but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards ." " i should like balls infinitely better ," she replied , " if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting . : 9.449564205911402
it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day ." " much more rational , my dear caroline , i dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball ." miss bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room . : 10.594779907503648
her figure was elegant , and she walked well ;-- but darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious . : 14.599077162329225
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to elizabeth , said , " miss eliza bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room .-- i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude ." elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately . : 11.230615955269068
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; mr . : 15.971548362809793
darcy looked up . : 54.62243413386829
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book . : 13.280034732144138
he was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would interfere . : 9.055917152984636
" what could he mean ? : 39.094932438420905
she was dying to know what could be his meaning "-- and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ? : 11.981600423490251
darcy in any thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives . : 16.296089405953687
" i have not the smallest objection to explaining them ," said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak . : 12.310233741703641
" you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ' s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ;-- if the first , i should be completely in your way ;-- and if the second , i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire ." " oh ! : 9.620133316916935
shocking !" cried miss bingley . : 17.0863290858173
" i never heard any thing so abominable . : 19.17748398698579
how shall we punish him for such a speech ?" " nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination ," said elizabeth . : 13.517925154223898
" we can all plague and punish one another . : 11.373385730950165
teaze him -- laugh at him .-- intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done ." " but upon my honour i do _not_ . : 11.510745728110052
i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_ . : 14.861959815830346
no , no -- i feel he may defy us there . : 15.598509626810678
darcy may hug himself ." " mr . : 16.21593112430224
" that is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon i hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance . : 14.530310602679293
the wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke ." " certainly ," replied elizabeth --" there are such people , but i hope i am not one of _them_ . : 11.641844004821658
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good . : 15.96397641035758
follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me , i own , and i laugh at them whenever i can .-- but these , i suppose , are precisely what you are without ." " perhaps that is not possible for any one . : 9.522929663094066
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule ." " such as vanity and pride ." " yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . : 9.172565113864577
" your examination of mr . : 22.674007284408958
darcy is over , i presume ," said miss bingley ;--" and pray what is the result ?" " i am perfectly convinced by it that mr . : 11.853736495916399
darcy has no defect . : 36.43990790061857
he owns it himself without disguise ." " no "-- said darcy , " i have made no such pretension . : 12.268704467758605
i have faults enough , but they are not , i hope , of understanding . : 23.828552831914383
my temper i dare not vouch for .-- it is i believe too little yielding -- certainly too little for the convenience of the world . : 10.562924011799357
i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought , nor their offences against myself . : 9.223921431758258
my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them . : 10.850055275533132
my temper would perhaps be called resentful .-- my good opinion once lost is lost for ever ." " _that_ is a failing indeed !"-- cried elizabeth . : 7.3252955139419225
but you have chosen your fault well .-- i really cannot _laugh_ at it . : 11.973350417689115
hurst ." her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano - forte was opened , and darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it . : 11.944711971744596
but mrs . : 68.91231980555446
bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday , which would exactly finish jane ' s week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before . : 11.02569222518691
her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to elizabeth ' s wishes , for she was impatient to get home . : 19.77554802624353
bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if mr . : 14.937652495375639
bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well .-- against staying longer , however , elizabeth was positively resolved -- nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged jane to borrow mr . : 8.864646040435554
bingley ' s carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made . : 12.43582147909105
the communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane ; and till the morrow , their going was deferred . : 10.392788775068192
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her -- that she was not enough recovered ; but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right . : 14.15129646622946
darcy it was welcome intelligence -- elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough . : 17.438792376491232
she attracted him more than he liked -- and miss bingley was uncivil to _her_ , and more teazing than usual to himself . : 12.712321333765848
steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her . : 10.689641043765947
on sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place . : 15.170001498172732
miss bingley ' s civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former .-- elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits . : 11.271818140319978
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother . : 11.643099332261954
bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure jane would have caught cold again .-- but their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle . : 13.276213517657359
the evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of jane and elizabeth . : 15.049902010449697
they found mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread - bare morality to listen to . : 8.332619285852113
catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort . : 16.10634800753389
much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been flogged , and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married . : 12.538715264200082
chapter xiii . : 36.386558963427106
" i hope , my dear ," said mr . : 17.227976891402193
bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , " that you have ordered a good dinner to - day , because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party ." " who do you mean , my dear ? : 12.78481463011508
i know of nobody that is coming i am sure , unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in , and i hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her . : 10.402092159777187
i do not believe she often sees such at home ." " the person of whom i speak , is a gentleman and a stranger ." mrs . : 11.936331595475625
bennet ' s eyes sparkled .--" a gentleman and a stranger ! : 12.378385088390107
it is mr . : 42.8303465035257
bingley i am sure . : 39.09682582799649
why jane -- you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing ! : 11.336836724983613
well , i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr . : 12.816213740001876
how unlucky ! : 75.33314413972215
lydia , my love , ring the bell . : 16.928545189377854
i must speak to hill , this moment ." " it is _not_ mr . : 17.072483127716392
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained . : 15.980635297713263
it is from my cousin , mr . : 24.318317260810336
collins , who , when i am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases ." " oh ! : 11.931430180703144
my dear ," cried his wife , " i cannot bear to hear that mentioned . : 12.407664200131967
pray do not talk of that odious man . : 18.578712119241914
i do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and i am sure if i had been you , i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it ." jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail . : 11.366871111555474
they had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which mrs . : 15.570705494816034
bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about . : 8.385802232372376
bennet , " and nothing can clear mr . : 20.917127678047024
i hate such false friends . : 22.83105259574877
why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ?" " why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear ." _hunsford , near westerham , kent , <NUM> th october . _ dear sir , the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since i have had the misfortune to lose him , i have frequently wished to heal the breach ; but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance .--" there , mrs . : 9.460405427413074
bennet ."-- my mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received ordination at easter , i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh , widow of sir lewis de bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england . : 7.072454259083108
as a clergyman , moreover , i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good - will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch . : 7.6038766019284525
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends ,-- but of this hereafter . : 10.525726038926443
if you should have no objection to receive me into your house , i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , monday , november <NUM> th , by four o ' clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se ' night following , which i can do without any inconvenience , as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day . : 9.754746172642937
i remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well - wisher and friend , william collins ." " at four o ' clock , therefore , we may expect this peace - making gentleman ," said mr . : 7.664181809391798
bennet , as he folded up the letter . : 22.930013399986642
" he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ; and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again ." " there is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he is disposed to make them any amends , i shall not be the person to discourage him ." " though it is difficult ," said jane , " to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit ." elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required . : 9.209899935173024
" he must be an oddity , i think ," said she . : 22.243886345645862
" i cannot make him out .-- there is something very pompous in his style .-- and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail ?-- we cannot suppose he would help it , if he could .-- can he be a sensible man , sir ?" " no , my dear ; i think not . : 9.739510163311191
i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse . : 12.844751111389488
there is a mixture of servility and self - importance in his letter , which promises well . : 11.916884806548017
i am impatient to see him ." " in point of composition ," said mary , " his letter does not seem defective . : 15.713107946628865
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet i think it is well expressed ." to catherine and lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting . : 9.943127112530679
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour . : 13.135540845393594
as for their mother , mr . : 33.351990161871406
collins ' s letter had done away much of her ill - will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters . : 14.375086471916182
collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family . : 16.709719494166244
bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and mr . : 14.373011999802593
collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself . : 11.604019687569716
he was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty . : 12.333101421865692
his air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal . : 15.250869533295512
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs . : 13.24401492962806
bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage . : 10.74128591743466
bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily , " you are very kind , sir , i am sure ; and i wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough . : 10.112499853701816
things are settled so oddly ." " you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate ." " ah ! : 11.70099451749737
sir , i do indeed . : 33.142236606376855
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess . : 16.791466080054374
not that i mean to find fault with _you_ , for such things i know are all chance in this world . : 14.43120995078267
there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed ." " i am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins ,-- and could say much on the subject , but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate . : 9.247668952773482
but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them . : 15.281348933838233
at present i will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted ----" he was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other . : 12.283639585502076
they were not the only objects of mr . : 18.70030551727488
collins ' s admiration . : 30.16540316587373
bennet ' s heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property . : 16.2292846683545
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its cookery was owing . : 12.13914282125152
bennet , who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen . : 15.14284290159837
he begged pardon for having displeased her . : 17.43442399993567
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour . : 10.177157995530266
chapter xiv . : 36.386558963427106
during dinner , mr . : 20.113753143290882
bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness . : 12.732195577972044
lady catherine de bourgh ' s attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable . : 12.21973355314229
bennet could not have chosen better . : 27.714878689075167
collins was eloquent in her praise . : 22.06318704481777
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank -- such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from lady catherine . : 10.264771814871418
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her . : 11.047906785504011
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings , and had sent for him only the saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening . : 10.594337603723803
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew , but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her . : 9.245701270991864
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations . : 13.053459692178931
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself ,-- some shelves in the closets up stairs . : 8.658214625724618
" that is all very proper and civil , i am sure ," said mrs . : 10.607226061705246
bennet , " and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman . : 16.89585784783476
does she live near you , sir ?" " the garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from rosings park , her ladyship ' s residence ." " i think you said she was a widow , sir ? : 10.186716541382763
has she any family ?" " she has one only daughter , the heiress of rosings , and of very extensive property ." " ah !" cried mrs . : 10.659768037567494
bennet , shaking her head , " then she is better off than many girls . : 13.35565477589154
and what sort of young lady is she ? : 24.638428807204807
is she handsome ?" " she is a most charming young lady indeed . : 17.157151101193968
lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth . : 9.558796103607982
she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them . : 8.613805574968898
but she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies ." " has she been presented ? : 10.48172414812344
i do not remember her name among the ladies at court ." " her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ; and by that means , as i told lady catherine myself one day , has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament . : 8.67020294313332
her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies . : 10.324465291667888
i have more than once observed to lady catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her .-- these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay ." " you judge very properly ," said mr . : 8.99370425696093
bennet ' s expectations were fully answered . : 14.480918215456391
by tea - time however the dose had been enough , and mr . : 13.79317572260579
bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing - room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies . : 12.511789921677268
collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , ( for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library ,) he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read novels .-- kitty stared at him , and lydia exclaimed .-- other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose fordyce ' s sermons . : 8.694238712714922
lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , " do you know , mama , that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard , and if he does , colonel forster will hire him . : 9.602707463623135
my aunt told me so herself on saturday . : 19.168490642949003
i shall walk to meryton to - morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when mr . : 14.11654905487956
collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , " i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit . : 7.737765472837745
it amazes me , i confess ;-- for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction . : 12.368602725716974
but i will no longer importune my young cousin ." then turning to mr . : 9.315798297595087
bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon . : 13.198832541304656
bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements . : 8.408925507091467
bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia ' s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but mr . : 12.660254405718934
bennet , and prepared for backgammon . : 24.790149335710502
chapter xv . : 36.386558963427106
collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance . : 8.355307750631303
the subjection in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self - conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity . : 9.534392028653473
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self - importance and humility . : 9.523989958067592
this was his plan of amends -- of atonement -- for inheriting their father ' s estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part . : 9.105251430138056
his plan did not vary on seeing them .-- miss bennet ' s lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice . : 9.93156160701433
the next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour ' s tête - à - tête with mrs . : 10.206224767406322
bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage - house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very jane he had fixed on .--" as to her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say -- she could not positively answer -- but she did not _know_ of any prepossession ;-- her _eldest_ daughter , she must just mention -- she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged ." mr . : 10.063104401932021
bennet was stirring the fire . : 21.147457557300836
elizabeth , equally next to jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course . : 12.132978864323919
bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good graces . : 14.18770278909891
lydia ' s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten ; every sister except mary agreed to go with her ; and mr . : 11.299240812043024
collins was to attend them , at the request of mr . : 19.008739109294535
bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither mr . : 14.315610359744099
collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to mr . : 10.419320880216464
bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at hunsford . : 15.570811151665467
such doings discomposed mr . : 22.135346785656676
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting mr . : 11.657740509628756
collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and mr . : 15.92185097995714
collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go . : 11.045820377601004
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_ . : 18.552142885000745
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them . : 10.315894523422362
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman - like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way . : 12.705736183072709
denny , concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed . : 9.289206865701756
all were struck with the stranger ' s air , all wondered who he could be , and kitty and lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot . : 8.816191447525881
denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , mr . : 10.061420468218852
wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps . : 13.067032148172768
this was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming . : 15.468454189002758
his appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address . : 17.156602291809076
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation -- a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street . : 7.429283349076759
on distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities . : 15.076028089499257
bingley was the principal spokesman , and miss bennet the principal object . : 23.084243604775658
he was then , he said , on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her . : 18.860994973477016
darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting . : 13.245839226172876
both changed colour , one looked white , the other red . : 13.081138936898427
wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat -- a salutation which mr . : 7.7572847649408345
darcy just deigned to return . : 25.6552602776021
what could be the meaning of it ?-- it was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know . : 15.497221674471687
in another minute mr . : 30.975469850576218
denny and mr . : 19.438643482990244
wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr . : 19.615946486416167
philips ' s house , and then made their bows , in spite of miss lydia ' s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of mrs . : 11.716082016374123
philips ' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation . : 11.095550706364152
philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see mr . : 11.577857565722278
jones ' s shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards mr . : 9.724147069118375
she received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice . : 11.956597975916145
philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that mr . : 8.537113465090147
denny had brought him from london , and that he was to have a lieutenant ' s commission in the ---- shire . : 15.576803359800321
she had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had mr . : 15.105813367204389
wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become " stupid , disagreeable fellows ." some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr . : 9.107279842250597
wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from longbourn would come in the evening . : 14.855641530295774
this was agreed to , and mrs . : 27.884379607464606
the prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits . : 13.400845289133072
collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless . : 8.637420639766928
as they walked home , elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister . : 11.41355095379582
collins on his return highly gratified mrs . : 18.66885443323204
bennet by admiring mrs . : 22.708935003808293
philips ' s manners and politeness . : 18.40452959977152
he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before . : 11.454037641408071
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life . : 16.78132450851253
as no objection was made to the young people ' s engagement with their aunt , and all mr . : 17.639399930668056
collins ' s scruples of leaving mr . : 14.663939879538827
bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing - room , that mr . : 9.24646603009898
wickham had accepted their uncle ' s invitation , and was then in the house . : 20.108178091906673
when this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , mr . : 12.772863753685453
collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when mrs . : 9.704827703963428
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in mrs . : 10.665105773996656
philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could . : 10.824531411827573
to the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle - piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long . : 12.18301285666116
it was over at last however . : 32.04326378762492
wickham walked into the room , elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration . : 13.455345195699048
the officers of the ---- shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman - like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but mr . : 14.378979306140085
wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as _they_ were superior to the broad - faced stuffy uncle philips , breathing port wine , who followed them into the room . : 9.35547761902093
wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread - bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker . : 8.544684898639076
with such rivals for the notice of the fair , as mr . : 21.092946209048144
collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs . : 9.406526399126598
philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin . : 10.754481255348193
when the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist . : 11.456462220429335
" i know little of the game , at present ," said he , " but i shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life ----" mrs . : 14.584298315359673
philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason . : 16.85783580521403
wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia . : 12.520462566082378
allowing for the common demands of the game , mr . : 13.25047092155269
wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with mr . : 14.446837437484414
she dared not even mention that gentleman . : 19.118103294108902
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved . : 19.941303373884278
wickham began the subject himself . : 34.060947119953276
he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long mr . : 9.032090228903078
darcy had been staying there . : 30.15391249678539
a clear ten thousand per annum . : 20.038790940918748
you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself -- for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy ." elizabeth could not but look surprised . : 10.18174343510345
" you may well be surprised , miss bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday .-- are you much acquainted with mr . : 10.797191971300306
darcy ?" " as much as i ever wish to be ," cried elizabeth warmly ,--" i have spent four days in the same house with him , and i think him very disagreeable ." " i have no right to give _my_ opinion ," said wickham , " as to his being agreeable or otherwise . : 13.541396395319305
i am not qualified to form one . : 16.536932330687918
i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge . : 14.052754967130843
it is impossible for _me_ to be impartial . : 26.26060747049768
i hope your plans in favour of the ---- shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood ." " oh ! : 14.262406419420758
no -- it is not for _me_ to be driven away by mr . : 16.728277162236047
if _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_ , he must go . : 16.557785408454492
we are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but i have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what i might proclaim to all the world ; a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is . : 10.938930369189489
his father , miss bennet , the late mr . : 25.719782833824816
darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend i ever had ; and i can never be in company with this mr . : 13.429989149729126
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father ." elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry . : 10.901997214811896
i knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them . : 10.386229614391658
society , i own , is necessary to me . : 26.47695179852351
i have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude . : 17.538473333894615
i _must_ have employment and society . : 17.28210443436969
a military life is not what i was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible . : 18.090450189957345
darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift . : 19.916181047792527
he was my godfather , and excessively attached to me . : 18.774177543354384
i cannot do justice to his kindness . : 25.056184732693872
he meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere ." " good heavens !" cried elizabeth ; " but how could _that_ be ?-- how could his will be disregarded ?-- why did not you seek legal redress ?" " there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law . : 10.158727334036644
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but mr . : 15.415788063556983
certain it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as i was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it . : 11.72059855957533
i have a warm , unguarded temper , and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him , and _to_ him , too freely . : 12.004502255317012
i can recal nothing worse . : 24.31151974846186
" but what ," said she , after a pause , " can have been his motive ?-- what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ?" " a thorough , determined dislike of me -- a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy . : 9.424314159178099
had the late mr . : 28.912379794545163
darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father ' s uncommon attachment to me , irritated him i believe very early in life . : 11.216930330370717
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood -- the sort of preference which was often given me ." " i had not thought mr . : 10.142269720044142
darcy so bad as this -- though i have never liked him , i had not thought so very ill of him -- i had supposed him to be despising his fellow - creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this !" after a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " i _do_ remember his boasting one day , at netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper . : 9.451782271746598
his disposition must be dreadful ." " i will not trust myself on the subject ," replied wickham , " _i_ can hardly be just to him ." elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , " to treat in such a manner , the god - son , the friend , the favourite of his father !"-- she could have added , " a young man too , like _you_ , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable "-- but she contented herself with " and one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as i think you said , in the closest manner !" " we were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care . : 10.767014802330522
_my_ father began life in the profession which your uncle , mr . : 10.420855973410825
philips , appears to do so much credit to -- but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr . : 13.075598461402926
darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property . : 23.776288226844926
he was most highly esteemed by mr . : 16.553644216666026
darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend . : 18.70987485251397
darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ , as of affection to myself ." " how strange !" cried elizabeth . : 11.290017257203367
" how abominable !-- i wonder that the very pride of this mr . : 20.275719563240017
darcy has not made him just to you !-- if from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest ,-- for dishonesty i must call it ." " it _is_ wonderful ,"-- replied wickham ,--" for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ;-- and pride has often been his best friend . : 7.3046830839977535
it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling . : 11.072659611085752
it has often led him to be liberal and generous ,-- to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor . : 11.001824282861785
family pride , and _filial_ pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this . : 21.028129295117907
not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the pemberley house , is a powerful motive . : 14.000209280229418
he has also _brotherly_ pride , which with _some_ brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers ." " what sort of a girl is miss darcy ?" he shook his head .--" i wish i could call her amiable . : 8.696617510141103
but she is too much like her brother ,-- very , very proud .-- as a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement . : 12.162644440945263
but she is nothing to me now . : 43.3000312234005
she is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and i understand highly accomplished . : 12.644433019956619
since her father ' s death , her home has been london , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education ." after many pauses and many trials of other subjects , elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying , " i am astonished at his intimacy with mr . : 9.808959856189945
bingley ! : 270.49228740368727
bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , i really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? : 16.07672280400797
how can they suit each other ?-- do you know mr . : 13.90797406960018
darcy is ." " probably not ;-- but mr . : 18.37674308199096
darcy can please where he chuses . : 19.041100274050777
he does not want abilities . : 28.954002678978057
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while . : 12.352331929075362
his pride never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal - minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable ,-- allowing something for fortune and figure ." the whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and mr . : 7.744274818621423
collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs . : 11.830626060366193
philips .-- the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter . : 16.23724430718746
it had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when mrs . : 17.852203214284597
philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy . : 11.461014471179992
" i know very well , madam ," said he , " that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things ,-- and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object . : 9.982049129066295
there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh , i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters ." mr . : 9.007550387103555
wickham ' s attention was caught ; and after observing mr . : 14.220261056222258
collins for a few moments , he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh . : 10.961840231070607
" lady catherine de bourgh ," she replied , " has very lately given him a living . : 13.292676989639546
i hardly know how mr . : 30.0296614020974
collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long ." " you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr . : 11.033791413861733
darcy ." " no , indeed , i did not .-- i knew nothing at all of lady catherine ' s connections . : 17.312193906168602
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday ." " her daughter , miss de bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates ." this information made elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor miss bingley . : 12.347466462465505
she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class ." elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr . : 9.344104437583727
wickham ' s attentions . : 32.19291364116662
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs . : 16.775303092140177
philips ' s supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body . : 16.477849411130887
whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done gracefully . : 15.778633988696837
elizabeth went away with her head full of him . : 29.405541211120426
she could think of nothing but of mr . : 20.796940270355485
collins were once silent . : 22.908074865311917
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and mr . : 11.775380041561775
collins , in describing the civility of mr . : 14.13665239394509
philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house . : 8.915832788303728
elizabeth related to jane the next day , what had passed between mr . : 14.784877779784395
wickham and herself . : 35.89581672574794
jane listened with astonishment and concern ;-- she knew not how to believe that mr . : 10.528275794073158
bingley ' s regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham .-- the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained . : 10.281893042764514
" they have both ," said she , " been deceived , i dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea . : 12.595516266536976
it is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side ." " very true , indeed ;-- and now , my dear jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ?-- do clear _them_ too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody ." " laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . : 9.950310710299057
my dearest lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr . : 9.97176245675742
darcy , to be treating his father ' s favourite in such a manner ,-- one , whom his father had promised to provide for .-- it is impossible . : 12.666244089479418
no man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it . : 15.663332609366677
can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? : 13.922516867373906
no ." " i can much more easily believe mr . : 20.48420142255106
bingley ' s being imposed on , than that mr . : 14.792466347447665
wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony .-- if it be not so , let mr . : 8.521140268798636
darcy contradict it . : 40.71088584596566
besides , there was truth in his looks ." " it is difficult indeed -- it is distressing .-- one does not know what to think ." " i beg your pardon ;-- one knows exactly what to think ." but jane could think with certainty on only one point ,-- that mr . : 8.08861531518759
bingley , if he _had been_ imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public . : 12.70648541204293
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; mr . : 12.186378645289853
bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield , which was fixed for the following tuesday . : 13.997450858972641
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation . : 9.843245717993835
to the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding mrs . : 11.159790633621897
bennet as much as possible , saying not much to elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others . : 20.383482341131934
they were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs . : 8.728218727386338
bennet ' s civilities . : 35.688377551023386
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family . : 18.700764585076406
bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr . : 10.797863338559775
bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card . : 24.887212331128087
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr . : 13.065071390887391
wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr . : 15.70267979432706
darcy ' s looks and behaviour . : 21.11564570508922
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr . : 9.732788004006602
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it . : 15.295757622240929
" while i can have my mornings to myself ," said she , " it is enough .-- i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . : 10.585068074063198
collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr . : 12.443182141248862
bingley ' s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ' s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop , or lady catherine de bourgh , by venturing to dance . : 10.361255046433136
" i am by no means of opinion , i assure you ," said he , " that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours , miss elizabeth , for the two first dances especially ,-- a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her ." elizabeth felt herself completely taken in . : 10.445038396220996
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances :-- and to have mr . : 9.061788489308436
collins instead ! : 72.57703709539152
her liveliness had been never worse timed . : 22.520798915079585
there was no help for it however . : 22.921191374167655
wickham ' s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and mr . : 11.531540690788846
collins ' s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could . : 11.63337475548735
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more .-- it now first struck her , that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors . : 8.468761064652163
the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_ . : 10.458647352863837
elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply . : 12.753154841374473
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once . : 12.990856155872633
no aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ;-- the very shoe - roses for netherfield were got by proxy . : 8.093408788357019
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr . : 9.877175646121014
wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday and monday , endurable to kitty and lydia . : 8.970376548212286
chapter xviii . : 40.26276396708214
till elizabeth entered the drawing - room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr . : 9.335069380414744
wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her . : 10.151110421985589
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her . : 10.098773030669578
she had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening . : 12.668749466248158
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr . : 10.402029199120104
darcy ' s pleasure in the bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr . : 14.229475451557535
denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , " i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here ." this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham ' s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .-- attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham . : 9.151793284861684
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr . : 11.681150118968723
bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her . : 14.445723425868232
collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give . : 8.137846253753588
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy . : 24.507818752886248
darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him . : 18.218222149073206
he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; charlotte tried to console her . : 11.186901429404694
elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr . : 10.849938607370603
darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it . : 10.108149230227422
he replied , and was again silent . : 33.74269200306578
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with " it is _your_ turn to say something now , mr . : 10.219418137376511
darcy .-- _i_ talked about the dance , and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples ." he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said . : 12.643647281104164
" very well .-- that reply will do for the present .-- perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones .-- but _now_ we may be silent ." " do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ?" " sometimes . : 8.39895686144372
one must speak a little , you know . : 28.601862238711522
" how near it may be to _mine_ , i cannot pretend to say .-- _you_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly ." " i must not decide on my own performance ." he made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton . : 11.141076351275014
she answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance ." the effect was immediate . : 10.819934787013834
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on . : 12.475963849031057
at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , " mr . : 16.207870433309214
wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends -- whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them , is less certain ." " he has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship ," replied elizabeth with emphasis , " and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life ." darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject . : 9.631893400650306
darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner . : 9.493952632606687
" i have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir . : 17.895765074174463
such very superior dancing is not often seen . : 21.351476461908767
it is evident that you belong to the first circles . : 25.071051480810713
what congratulations will then flow in ! : 17.957249077357055
i appeal to mr . : 30.231900409114242
darcy :-- but let me not interrupt you , sir .-- you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me ." the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy ; but sir william ' s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane , who were dancing together . : 8.850739626955434
recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " sir william ' s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of ." " i do not think we were speaking at all . : 10.798383221372305
" books -- oh ! : 31.79649955133693
no .-- i am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings ." " i am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject .-- we may compare our different opinions ." " no -- i cannot talk of books in a ball - room ; my head is always full of something else ." " the _present_ always occupies you in such scenes -- does it ?" said he , with a look of doubt . : 9.735729497080756
" yes , always ," she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , " i remember hearing you once say , mr . : 11.831880637539786
darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable . : 11.249498857430645
you are very cautious , i suppose , as to its _being created_ ." " i am ," said he , with a firm voice . : 12.26656229421077
" i do not get on at all . : 18.202052315599023
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly ." " i can readily believe ," answered he gravely , " that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either ." " but if i do not take your likeness now , i may never have another opportunity ." " i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours ," he coldly replied . : 8.917372476736872
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , " so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham !-- your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old wickham , the late mr . : 11.440624098275661
darcy ' s steward . : 33.06243297340963
let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to mr . : 15.399749076871549
darcy ' s using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated mr . : 11.452673852289
darcy in a most infamous manner . : 31.20153212004296
i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr . : 15.180548199337768
darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . : 13.50051218623692
his coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it . : 15.856551298839122
i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ' s guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better ." " his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same ," said elizabeth angrily ; " for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr . : 11.465628214516103
darcy ' s steward , and of _that_ , i can assure you , he informed me himself ." " i beg your pardon ," replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer . : 12.80678039658151
" excuse my interference .-- it was kindly meant ." " insolent girl !" said elizabeth to herself .--" you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . : 10.87337250850201
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr . : 12.397254704764572
darcy ." she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley . : 13.797725522217007
" i want to know ," said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ' s , " what you have learnt about mr . : 13.795109418087383
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon ." " no ," replied jane , " i have not forgotten him ; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you . : 11.853180740692535
bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr . : 14.167780091331991
darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that mr . : 17.980191540276348
wickham has deserved much less attention from mr . : 9.950379296811906
wickham is by no means a respectable young man . : 15.242355813012704
bingley does not know mr . : 27.98666775625736
wickham himself ?" " no ; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton ." " this account then is what he has received from mr . : 13.207285745013477
i am perfectly satisfied . : 36.589547999128605
but what does he say of the living ?" " he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from mr . : 13.535782839794788
bingley ' s sincerity ," said elizabeth warmly ; " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . : 10.364180597236606
bingley ' s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before ." she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment . : 10.57229763549717
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley ' s regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it . : 11.08509287904505
on their being joined by mr . : 21.337838664004906
collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery . : 13.65374162779068
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh , and of her mother lady catherine . : 11.53510080142775
who would have thought of my meeting with -- perhaps -- a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly !-- i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . : 9.646601366449689
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology ." " you are not going to introduce yourself to mr . : 11.198617373933747
darcy ?" " indeed i am . : 39.154377949843806
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . : 11.391157626176614
i believe him to be lady catherine ' s _nephew_ . : 27.341549310134102
it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se ' night ." elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that mr . : 9.548191714610017
darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to mr . : 9.433875009318916
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty . : 11.498473957784428
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself ." and with a low bow he left her to attack mr . : 7.181151567634167
darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident . : 11.799357125768893
darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last mr . : 14.708711463730895
collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility . : 12.279735088860793
collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and mr . : 14.129903692159944
darcy ' s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way . : 11.665507145407988
collins then returned to elizabeth . : 32.85912818458161
" i have no reason , i assure you ," said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception . : 14.422683741458753
darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . : 23.48861549791622
he answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of lady catherine ' s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily . : 12.059336069760336
it was really a very handsome thought . : 25.440869478545743
she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like bingley ' s two sisters . : 10.732263171232594
her mother ' s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much . : 10.43029335288946
when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( lady lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr . : 9.211870579208671
bingley .-- it was an animating subject , and mrs . : 20.940733356463834
bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match . : 12.105028970966691
his being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self - gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do . : 13.931322398354888
it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane ' s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked . : 11.626566110601495
bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life . : 13.559488460017988
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it . : 10.092604639847309
darcy , who sat opposite to them . : 19.781516700438186
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical . : 16.812340648816946
" what is mr . : 39.326486475308926
darcy to me , pray , that i should be afraid of him ? : 25.285657259030277
i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear ." " for heaven ' s sake , madam , speak lower .-- what advantage can it be to you to offend mr . : 9.381186653646385
darcy ?-- you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing ." nothing that she could say , however , had any influence . : 15.064504367554317
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone . : 19.476620993901506
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation . : 9.714156926509244
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr . : 9.927701503772191
darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her . : 14.134165778951566
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity . : 10.754187218331221
at length however mrs . : 25.534195992445238
elizabeth now began to revive . : 29.102389459377513
by many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance ,-- but in vain ; mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song . : 9.058044525130043
elizabeth ' s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another . : 9.92639671942321
she looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave . : 11.151829426826255
she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night . : 10.516352735583697
he took the hint , and when mary had finished her second song , said aloud , " that will do extremely well , child . : 11.609371283338684
you have delighted us long enough . : 21.223985363277983
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit ." mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father ' s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good .-- others of the party were now applied to . : 12.399842550913935
" if i ," said mr . : 27.66572096131259
he must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible . : 11.198977402742962
and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . : 8.934545194522043
darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .-- many stared .-- many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than mr . : 9.532521847085176
to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . : 12.166197765615669
that his two sisters and mr . : 24.142044203929903
collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others . : 13.917914089894984
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room . : 15.459585792642617
he assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening . : 12.866175253071587
there was no arguing upon such a project . : 19.818787987542215
collins ' s conversation to herself . : 19.702590327080944
she was at least free from the offence of mr . : 17.396337627447576
darcy ' s farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak . : 11.956474855517211
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr . : 15.784212301730603
wickham , and rejoiced in it . : 30.3008183392586
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manoeuvre of mrs . : 14.855242366811785
bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family . : 10.33452419701974
they repulsed every attempt of mrs . : 15.957446680701466
bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr . : 11.645701617278213
collins , who was complimenting mr . : 17.616338481490203
bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests . : 12.414152191431139
darcy said nothing at all . : 27.954670037179085
bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other . : 17.557451669226364
hurst or miss bingley ; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of " lord , how tired i am !" accompanied by a violent yawn . : 9.125290286766651
when at length they arose to take leave , mrs . : 11.982786411390796
bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation . : 14.19045519949722
bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield , in the course of three or four months . : 8.971566440515845
of having another daughter married to mr . : 17.00374186333851
collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure . : 14.778763902093159
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_ , the worth of each was eclipsed by mr . : 12.518692921333193
chapter xix . : 36.386558963427106
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn . : 14.001195552090138
collins made his declaration in form . : 14.876655340490398
having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business . : 11.906567490785505
on finding mrs . : 42.75349342981523
bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , " may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ?" before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , mrs . : 11.438197976403957
bennet instantly answered , " oh dear !-- yes -- certainly .-- i am sure lizzy will be very happy -- i am sure she can have no objection .-- come , kitty , i want you up stairs ." and gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when elizabeth called out , " dear ma ' am , do not go .-- i beg you will not go .-- mr . : 9.595504732452959
collins must excuse me .-- he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear . : 15.655258895740365
i am going away myself ." " no , no , nonsense , lizzy .-- i desire you will stay where you are ."-- and upon elizabeth ' s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , " lizzy , i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing mr . : 8.733353977228541
collins ." elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction -- and a moment ' s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion . : 9.753071288343184
collins began . : 72.17252867454295
you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother ' s permission for this address . : 9.737502461942983
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . : 9.18669369693607
almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life . : 10.887609879692173
collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : " my reasons for marrying are , first , that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish . : 7.835330687195039
secondly , that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly -- which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness . : 9.394863079199329
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too !) on this subject ; and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford -- between our pools at quadrille , while mrs . : 6.767627681070502
jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh ' s foot - stool , that she said , ' mr . : 9.203874666802026
a clergyman like you must marry .-- chuse properly , chuse a gentlewoman for _my_ sake ; and for your _own_ , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . : 8.447994243242341
this is my advice . : 37.44245054191547
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where i assure you there are many amiable young women . : 8.120167034036006
but the fact is , that being , as i am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , ( who , however , may live many years longer ,) i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place -- which , however , as i have already said , may not be for several years . : 10.376817959223
this has been my motive , my fair cousin , and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . : 15.01043149813313
and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . : 15.781586783427015
which will not be yours till after your mother ' s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to . : 15.405918804322365
on that head , therefore , i shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married ." it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now . : 8.234258283690979
" you forget that i have made no answer . : 22.334919176331617
let me do it without farther loss of time . : 13.260084235221438
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me . : 16.14446309678202
collins , with a formal wave of the hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time . : 8.930596360086788
i am perfectly serious in my refusal .-- you could not make _me_ happy , and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so .-- nay , were your friend lady catherine to know me , i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation ." " were it certain that lady catherine would think so ," said mr . : 11.100024729664666
collins very gravely --" but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you . : 13.331479283022016
collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary . : 22.193973866475247
you must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what i say . : 12.635593937262838
i wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise . : 11.949726933173595
in making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self - reproach . : 10.581089254586637
this matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled ." and rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not mr . : 14.24539133146052
collins thus addressed her , " when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character ." " really , mr . : 10.46446366339294
collins ," cried elizabeth with some warmth , " you puzzle me exceedingly . : 15.747373324633086
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one ." " you must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course . : 9.949354538036506
my reasons for believing it are briefly these :-- it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable . : 8.375325849515205
my situation in life , my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . : 10.28286202156048
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . : 8.209882908895358
i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere . : 15.620030094950394
i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible . : 13.300866008675461
my feelings in every respect forbid it . : 16.421692941285354
can i speak plainer ? : 27.975148036556245
do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart ." " you are uniformly charming !" cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; " and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable ." to such perseverance in wilful self - deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female . : 8.412870233920517
chapter xx . : 47.86087507640933
collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for mrs . : 15.01900713118236
collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character . : 9.250089627321989
this information , however , startled mrs . : 19.906541803328587
bennet ;-- she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so . : 12.118110539314698
collins ," she added , " that lizzy shall be brought to reason . : 13.151168981745856
i will speak to her about it myself directly . : 26.377844299221692
she is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but i will _make_ her know it ." " pardon me for interrupting you , madam ," cried mr . : 12.857652643336822
collins ; " but if she is really headstrong and foolish , i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . : 13.378846409023263
if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity ." " sir , you quite misunderstand me ," said mrs . : 8.9766697289301
" lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these . : 13.9919034897269
in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived . : 16.442412869835277
i will go directly to mr . : 21.17421824011985
bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , i am sure ." she would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , " oh ! : 13.684135622369494
bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar . : 18.22788834521226
you must come and make lizzy marry mr . : 15.820428905064643
collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_ ." mr . : 12.352118691634502
bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication . : 13.634870721081853
" of what are you talking ?" " of mr . : 23.6623193738107
collins and lizzy . : 42.13868347001597
lizzy declares she will not have mr . : 20.14857224855233
collins , and mr . : 28.047106197041874
collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy ." " and what am i to do on the occasion ?-- it seems an hopeless business ." " speak to lizzy about it yourself . : 12.12200011020511
tell her that you insist upon her marrying him ." " let her be called down . : 12.851839142179122
she shall hear my opinion ." mrs . : 18.216093746999597
bennet rang the bell , and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library . : 21.078804861127512
" come here , child ," cried her father as she appeared . : 19.353955336513913
" i have sent for you on an affair of importance . : 15.083068267244107
is it true ?" elizabeth replied that it was . : 21.257775708437006
" very well -- and this offer of marriage you have refused ?" " i have , sir ." " very well . : 15.19759652568746
we now come to the point . : 36.1024751878875
is not it so , mrs . : 29.19472132166141
bennet ?" " yes , or i will never see her again ." " an unhappy alternative is before you , elizabeth . : 16.33413477124122
collins , and i will never see you again if you _do_ ." elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but mrs . : 12.810143669553955
bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed . : 13.978689169548245
bennet , by talking in this way ? : 26.64187472579022
you promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him ." " my dear ," replied her husband , " i have two small favours to request . : 11.099216140617157
first , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room . : 18.515415835008373
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be ." not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did mrs . : 14.743662184987688
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest , but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering ;-- and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks . : 9.176226405856179
though her manner varied however , her determination never did . : 16.339070997321173
collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed . : 11.38014572674144
his regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother ' s reproach prevented his feeling any regret . : 13.854720330728753
while the family were in this confusion , charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them . : 16.143163216997632
she was met in the vestibule by lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , " i am glad you are come , for there is such fun here !-- what do you think has happened this morning ?-- mr . : 10.793879023698006
collins has made an offer to lizzy , and she will not have him ." charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast - room , where mrs . : 13.741272621776046
bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on miss lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family . : 12.08364421274062
" pray do , my dear miss lucas ," she added in a melancholy tone , " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , i am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves ." charlotte ' s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth . : 9.459748035193075
" aye , there she comes ," continued mrs . : 14.225514713523426
bennet , " looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at york , provided she can have her own way .-- but i tell you what , miss lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all -- and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead .-- _i_ shall not be able to keep you -- and so i warn you .-- i have done with you from this very day .-- i told you in the library , you know , that i should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word . : 10.33068200222206
i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children .-- not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body . : 9.811114013521388
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking . : 9.292035838363292
nobody can tell what i suffer !-- but it is always so . : 15.958976190841849
those who do not complain are never pitied ." her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation . : 6.1470376223641825
collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , " now , i do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let mr . : 14.753628273872062
collins and me have a little conversation together ." elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and charlotte , detained first by the civility of mr . : 11.176925096468233
collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear . : 12.295543398583806
in a doleful voice mrs . : 20.385111291952327
bennet thus began the projected conversation .--" oh ! : 11.816234382877123
collins !"-- " my dear madam ," replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point . : 13.579381348692296
far be it from me ," he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter . : 9.302301923750587
resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment ; and i trust i am resigned . : 9.988877675895544
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . : 7.360080375578835
you will not , i hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter ' s favour , without having paid yourself and mr . : 9.60961677877759
bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf . : 10.811346267856042
but we are all liable to error . : 21.283064803522407
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair . : 17.688542217465873
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible , i here beg leave to apologise ." chapter xxi . : 11.192333178985592
the discussion of mr . : 37.25325447009264
collins ' s offer was now nearly at an end , and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother . : 10.379672018547073
he scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend . : 14.134513701004478
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs . : 13.661814884618153
bennet ' s ill humour or ill health . : 13.692386585044789
collins was also in the same state of angry pride . : 17.744043521244645
he was always to have gone on saturday , and to saturday he still meant to stay . : 16.813104276066
after breakfast , the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr . : 13.305247435447026
wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball . : 16.2835895815434
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt ' s , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over .-- to elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed . : 10.353955561867156
darcy ;-- that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than i could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself ." she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her . : 12.819366278418798
his accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother . : 12.257199985046501
soon after their return , a letter was delivered to miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and was opened immediately . : 14.322072034612601
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady ' s fair , flowing hand ; and elizabeth saw her sister ' s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages . : 8.810225406470263
when they had gained their own room , jane taking out the letter , said , " this is from caroline bingley ; what it contains , has surprised me a good deal . : 10.90146746296278
the whole party have left netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again . : 13.332095586500444
you shall hear what she says ." she then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street , where mr . : 10.089227096057016
hurst had a house . : 35.06796375683964
the next was in these words . : 35.732332459889605
" i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence . : 9.333681836335838
i depend on you for that ." to these high flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr . : 9.59692609436862
bingley ' s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his . : 15.432340008042049
" it is unlucky ," said she , after a short pause , " that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country . : 11.613304096426353
but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ?-- mr . : 9.348122966311061
bingley will not be detained in london by them ." " caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter . : 10.488325800812639
i will read it to you -- " when my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to london , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel . : 10.857577385720665
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you ." " it is evident by this ," added jane , " that he comes back no more this winter ." " it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he _should_ ." " why will you think so ? : 9.89698916304025
it must be his own doing .-- he is his own master . : 24.374762463814868
but you do not know _all_ . : 29.349403478374306
i _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me . : 10.495669193913026
i will have no reserves from _you_ ." " mr . : 17.899362599114333
darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again . : 11.081940195179957
i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister . : 9.224717626300444
i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but i will not leave the country without confiding them , and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable . : 10.538474637071035
my brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister ' s partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman ' s heart . : 9.794070924376307
with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am i wrong , my dearest jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ?" " what think you of _this_ sentence , my dear lizzy ?"-- said jane as she finished it . : 9.843163761041692
" is it not clear enough ?-- does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ' s indifference , and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly !) to put me on my guard ? : 9.436075639974588
can there be any other opinion on the subject ?" " yes , there can ; for mine is totally different .-- will you hear it ?" " most willingly ." " you shall have it in few words . : 10.519852674135839
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry miss darcy . : 17.177214327585812
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you ." jane shook her head . : 14.00827425341918
" indeed , jane , you ought to believe me .-- no one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection . : 15.994456476283515
miss bingley i am sure cannot . : 24.15371909607273
she is not such a simpleton . : 42.54221385249252
could she have seen half as much love in mr . : 17.598940702529944
darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes . : 19.998318526915572
but the case is this . : 39.62055233133505
we are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and i dare say it would succeed , if miss de bourgh were out of the way . : 10.676183158803301
but , my dearest jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend ." " if we thought alike of miss bingley ," replied jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quite easy . : 10.797666715725702
but i know the foundation is unjust . : 25.704182048327606
a thousand things may arise in six months !" the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt . : 9.543894332191494
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline ' s interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one . : 9.526596331484106
jane ' s temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart . : 11.420317885137093
they agreed that mrs . : 29.107500936632988
bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ' s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together . : 10.431107212614243
after lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that mr . : 11.09334875969165
bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses . : 13.783523234883903
chapter xxii . : 47.86087507640933
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr . : 14.572938759403089
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her . : 18.270605141893807
this was very amiable , but charlotte ' s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of ;-- its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of mr . : 10.484022350455138
collins ' s addresses , by engaging them towards herself . : 12.786146103618407
such was miss lucas ' s scheme ; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon . : 11.108664911677739
but here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet . : 11.497170739691201
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday . : 9.679098471847595
his reception however was of the most flattering kind . : 23.83650408902619
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane . : 11.856586216788658
but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there . : 12.018055277388205
in as short a time as mr . : 20.030754850642165
collins ' s long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness . : 11.896791463997076
collins ' s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair . : 9.862502821778925
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer mr . : 9.414590203200957
bennet was likely to live ; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever mr . : 16.082619703294828
collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st . : 10.247367358430603
james ' s . : 23.76755932826439
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion . : 14.225437080725907
the younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte ' s dying an old maid . : 7.783018593390832
charlotte herself was tolerably composed . : 14.800262221711847
her reflections were in general satisfactory . : 32.26191270874085
collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary . : 12.423952751853594
this preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty - seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it . : 12.341632165191793
the least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person . : 14.582296831139312
elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation . : 13.266770406942513
she resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged mr . : 20.2238547996558
collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . : 13.786783100921328
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self - denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love . : 8.506331700362677
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave - taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and mrs . : 11.397506992444862
bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them . : 11.125724785967725
" my dear madam ," he replied , " this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible ." they were all astonished ; and mr . : 11.60194353166434
bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , " but is there not danger of lady catherine ' s disapprobation here , my good sir ?-- you had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness ." " my dear sir ," replied mr . : 8.076019089797576
collins , " i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship ' s concurrence ." " you cannot be too much on your guard . : 9.984034429134889
risk any thing rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which i should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence ." " believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire . : 9.581290282689947
as for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin elizabeth ." with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return . : 7.90394292851867
bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him . : 13.739452092678732
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her ' s , he might become a very agreeable companion . : 9.72281625578833
but on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away . : 20.10360907425542
miss lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before . : 13.186830990576567
the possibility of mr . : 34.23412523319595
collins ' s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " engaged to mr . : 10.255587860345715
collins ! : 179.78247481655706
my dear charlotte ,-- impossible !" the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied , " why should you be surprised , my dear eliza ?-- do you think it incredible that mr . : 8.109976816672372
collins should be able to procure any woman ' s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ?" but elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness . : 11.901921524726339
" i see what you are feeling ," replied charlotte ,--" you must be surprised , very much surprised ,-- so lately as mr . : 10.47786934986444
but when you have had time to think it all over , i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done . : 20.40492993069963
i never was . : 59.286640541551556
i ask only a comfortable home ; and considering mr . : 18.65250858312816
collins ' s character , connections , and situation in life , i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state ." elizabeth quietly answered " undoubtedly ;"-- and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family . : 9.475126428945543
charlotte did not stay much longer , and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard . : 15.753005598773784
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match . : 14.537615234536126
the strangeness of mr . : 32.41131651182597
collins ' s making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted . : 10.206544729181628
collins , was a most humiliating picture !-- and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen . : 12.071545505502446
chapter xxiii . : 47.86087507640933
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family . : 10.187964518982687
with many compliments to them , and much self - gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter ,-- to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mrs . : 10.602504781110843
bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , " good lord ! : 10.157031000349068
collins wants to marry lizzy ?" nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but sir william ' s good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy . : 9.990337510384673
elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of mr . : 9.768337647273892
collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london . : 15.491757508272839
bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent . : 10.310260304201664
in the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that mr . : 13.440874692363561
two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ; one , that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day . : 11.173129633496089
nothing could console and nothing appease her .-- nor did that day wear out her resentment . : 7.687276848320195
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter . : 10.736802294914256
bennet ' s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter ! : 13.531111502551457
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for mr . : 11.373467730091
collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton . : 12.524806228270672
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs . : 9.838105667743896
bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs . : 12.680307589982812
bennet ' s sour looks and ill - natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away . : 10.579333646987498
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again . : 8.712970042811413
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return . : 9.999627392913451
the promised letter of thanks from mr . : 17.08013020253999
after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men . : 9.016021444391946
collins ' s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs . : 11.405356575383756
bennet . : 129.10810026154508
on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .-- it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome .-- she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable . : 10.40807272203444
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs . : 13.003392254152155
bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr . : 16.38526312172915
bingley ' s continued absence . : 22.703581806384523
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject . : 9.851123467768339
bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . : 14.614854619422536
even elizabeth began to fear -- not that bingley was indifferent -- but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away . : 12.115866784435617
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane ' s happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring . : 10.616112339245948
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment . : 14.28602245490795
as for jane , _her_ anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than elizabeth ' s ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to . : 13.668513806157213
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used . : 11.001364593445954
it needed all jane ' s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity . : 9.195535365858776
collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight , but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction . : 12.728956927636878
he was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love - making relieved them from a great deal of his company . : 14.340514335325604
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge , and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed . : 13.471489832843167
bennet was really in a most pitiable state . : 26.613942920238284
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of . : 11.175213103416253
as her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence . : 16.654361807607344
collins , was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as mr . : 15.958410284916598
bennet were dead . : 40.309882917002504
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband . : 26.196855215233906
" indeed , mr . : 35.165429438324146
bennet ," said she , " it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that i should be forced to make way for _her_ , and live to see her take my place in it !" " my dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . : 10.368816466427228
let us hope for better things . : 11.843650441521802
bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , " i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate . : 16.84414231146793
if it was not for the entail i should not mind it ." " what should not you mind ?" " i should not mind any thing at all ." " let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility ." " i never can be thankful , mr . : 12.6276611052957
bennet , for any thing about the entail . : 36.080082462131436
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ' s own daughters i cannot understand ; and all for the sake of mr . : 11.18415527508867
collins too !-- why should _he_ have it more than anybody else ?" " i leave it to yourself to determine ," said mr . : 10.759292122116781

miss bingley ' s letter arrived , and put an end to doubt . : 14.445196779368272
the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter , and concluded with her brother ' s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country . : 11.599161656146858
hope was over , entirely over ; and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort . : 11.626912355701165
miss darcy ' s praise occupied the chief of it . : 13.085271089286039
her many attractions were again dwelt on , and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter . : 10.985918408767457
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother ' s being an inmate of mr . : 13.632448971046749
darcy ' s house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture . : 10.67797337140971
elizabeth , to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation . : 12.289659220923893
her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others . : 15.919962013706467
to caroline ' s assertion of her brother ' s being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit . : 14.002272229668465
that he was really fond of jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations . : 11.884263605818338
had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister ' s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself . : 12.993425077251825
it was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing . : 18.452502497119934
she could think of nothing else , and yet whether bingley ' s regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ' interference ; whether he had been aware of jane ' s attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister ' s situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded . : 9.851192706372398
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth ; but at last on mrs . : 13.809112590301217
that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . : 11.809485702355763
but i will not repine . : 31.342642423285458
" you doubt me ," cried jane , slightly colouring ; " indeed you have no reason . : 16.324873869534308
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all . : 18.655886380796815
i have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with . : 16.370047098655547
thank god ! : 39.444116149480614
i have not _that_ pain . : 24.18043220124738
a little time therefore .-- i shall certainly try to get the better ." with a stronger voice she soon added , " i have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself ." " my dear jane !" exclaimed elizabeth , " you are too good . : 10.661527691477026
your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; i do not know what to say to you . : 11.922740928660465
i feel as if i had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve ." miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister ' s warm affection . : 10.341596910994767
" nay ," said elizabeth , " this is not fair . : 19.95205457276757
_you_ wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if i speak ill of any body . : 18.351111858507913
_i_ only want to think _you_ perfect , and you set yourself against it . : 12.019842054977302
do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will . : 10.07010372240427
you need not . : 61.4544573673937
there are few people whom i really love , and still fewer of whom i think well . : 14.369752099920865
the more i see of the world , the more am i dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense . : 13.02240630711719
it is unaccountable ! : 49.87590589772972
in every view it is unaccountable !" " my dear lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . : 13.249061648466448
they will ruin your happiness . : 19.873070325503985
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper . : 11.477798885884544
collins ' s respectability , and charlotte ' s prudent , steady character . : 16.326008268246614
remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for every body ' s sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin ." " to oblige you , i would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him , i should only think worse of her understanding , than i now do of her heart . : 12.629831634970568
my dear jane , mr . : 24.554161398254585
collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow - minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as i do ; and you must feel , as well as i do , that the woman who marries him , cannot have a proper way of thinking . : 11.010826300186116
you shall not defend her , though it is charlotte lucas . : 24.414885611302832
you shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness ." " i must think your language too strong in speaking of both ," replied jane , " and i hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together . : 8.981852152313445
you alluded to something else . : 28.28032502976362
i cannot misunderstand you , but i intreat you , dear lizzy , not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . : 11.694118380966977
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured . : 11.66779691057817
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect . : 13.259163160177362
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us . : 11.037463270133104
bingley ' s conduct to design ," said elizabeth ; " but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery . : 12.392154571792744
thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people ' s feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business ." " and do you impute it to either of those ?" " yes ; to the last . : 12.639232441666774
but if i go on , i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem . : 13.656007269369743
stop me whilst you can ." " you persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him ." " yes , in conjunction with his friend ." " i cannot believe it . : 11.494450199500703
why should they try to influence him ? : 12.924593743798495
they can only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it ." " your first position is false . : 11.348454986917885
they have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better . : 9.687983650740076
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? : 12.525304443203993
if they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed . : 13.730486232054522
by supposing such an affection , you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy . : 14.66015182792855
do not distress me by the idea . : 25.997879457733546
i am not ashamed of having been mistaken -- or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . : 12.376201572711855
let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood ." elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time mr . : 15.285742979275309
bingley ' s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them . : 12.77822777789436
bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity . : 9.911432869726038
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day . : 12.983895285152718
bennet ' s best comfort was , that mr . : 16.268353736529132
bingley must be down again in the summer . : 28.615240241637384
bennet treated the matter differently . : 27.678633267818757
i congratulate her . : 56.67859325971228
next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then . : 15.579975089128443
it is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . : 17.58057141688101
when is your turn to come ? : 29.026727049929587
you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane . : 19.313180160185148
now is your time . : 43.89576971828208
here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . : 11.25224099282524
let wickham be _your_ man . : 16.565959748477177
bennet , " but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it ." mr . : 11.260248047280237
wickham ' s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom , which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family . : 7.830154907030815
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard , his claims on mr . : 17.417819479495908
darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr . : 12.45783700080451
darcy before they had known any thing of the matter . : 30.166290673411183
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of hertfordshire ; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes -- but by everybody else mr . : 7.289436938453774
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , mr . : 8.984664791542532
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks . : 9.480413240266321
bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn . : 12.717966343795323
gardiner was a sensible , gentleman - like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education . : 11.555073535744127
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable . : 13.159695046172232
gardiner , who was several years younger than mrs . : 11.532374972279985
bennet and mrs . : 37.5036663817954
philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces . : 14.325996938466268
between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard . : 12.09674446750832
they had frequently been staying with her in town . : 20.819373678613474
gardiner ' s business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions . : 9.439485848183596
when this was done , she had a less active part to play . : 18.23641640025516
it became her turn to listen . : 25.466948971964918
bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of . : 16.114215243393403
they had all been very ill - used since she last saw her sister . : 12.32214272234531
two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it . : 20.057724891234475
" i do not blame jane ," she continued , " for jane would have got mr . : 14.718643279677579
bingley , if she could . : 45.289209910173035
but , lizzy ! : 59.91821041711016
collins ' s wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness . : 17.8688379485774
he made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him . : 18.283398109601826
the consequence of it is , that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have , and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever . : 17.12603551415439
the lucases are very artful people indeed , sister . : 16.497561573134174
they are all for what they can get . : 26.927017992556117
i am sorry to say it of them , but so it is . : 27.38366291423178
it makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else . : 11.071703129186556
however , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and i am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves ." mrs . : 11.298100779753835
gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of jane and elizabeth ' s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation . : 13.997983271755787
when alone with elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject . : 16.157017208992933
" i am sorry it went off . : 15.197466539123035
but these things happen so often ! : 22.392013225897724
a young man , such as you describe mr . : 21.378316086861116
bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent ." " an excellent consolation in its way ," said elizabeth , " but it will not do for _us_ . : 10.45940383592863
we do not suffer by _accident_ . : 18.367250375399205
it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before ." " but that expression of ' violently in love ' is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea . : 9.227535841254559
it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half - hour ' s acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment . : 12.54551438989364
pray , how _violent was_ mr . : 12.371439344885447
bingley ' s love ?" " i never saw a more promising inclination . : 14.058079418434819
he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . : 13.359034762126505
every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable . : 14.492619063722584
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and i spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer . : 12.469508625937323
could there be finer symptoms ? : 19.314718194821157
is not general incivility the very essence of love ?" " oh , yes !-- of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt . : 12.916612116563908
poor jane ! : 41.63943490681743
i am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately . : 18.986033193988852
it had better have happened to _you_ , lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . : 15.44102624419298
but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? : 19.244709268937225
gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her . : 12.142579162948605
we live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her ." " and _that_ is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and mr . : 11.757821912449751
my dear aunt , how could you think of it ? : 24.169561637947112
darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as gracechurch street , but he would hardly think a month ' s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , mr . : 8.982848047674402
bingley never stirs without him ." " so much the better . : 14.22948145695927
i hope they will not meet at all . : 24.832111982735334
_she_ will not be able to help calling ." " she will drop the acquaintance entirely ." but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley ' s being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless . : 10.025262172434841
it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re - animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane ' s attractions . : 14.067082288620938
miss bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure ; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by caroline ' s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him . : 13.241538090642134
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn ; and what with the philipses , the lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement . : 15.97324859400552
bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner . : 13.80224237131673
wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , mrs . : 15.427182561686108
to mrs . : 72.48696085529807
about ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire , to which he belonged . : 12.482271005348291
they had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy ' s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring . : 12.924525792441331
gardiner had seen pemberley , and known the late mr . : 18.184315944241465
darcy by character perfectly well . : 21.859725158553935
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse . : 12.987944180548999
in comparing her recollection of pemberley , with the minute description which wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself . : 9.325200430600082
on being made acquainted with the present mr . : 23.062689434786943
darcy ' s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman ' s reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard mr . : 10.506247685312214
fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill - natured boy . : 10.670623245544212
gardiner ' s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : " you are too sensible a girl , lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , i am not afraid of speaking openly . : 9.948892087782479
seriously , i would have you be on your guard . : 21.027474193061828
do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . : 11.744450175850305
i have nothing to say against _him_ ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , i should think you could not do better . : 15.14538623908871
but as it is -- you must not let your fancy run away with you . : 17.02951196848893
you have sense , and we all expect you to use it . : 18.325791485399055
your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct , i am sure . : 11.283806829145291
you must not disappoint your father ." " my dear aunt , this is being serious indeed ." " yes , and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise ." " well , then , you need not be under any alarm . : 12.470372645652644
i will take care of myself , and of mr . : 21.599824165415075
he shall not be in love with me , if i can prevent it ." " elizabeth , you are not serious now ." " i beg your pardon . : 16.873235908680833
i will try again . : 34.06053462881222
at present i am not in love with mr . : 22.188353123212096
wickham ; no , i certainly am not . : 32.299035100206325
but he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man i ever saw -- and if he becomes really attached to me -- i believe it will be better that he should not . : 13.55000962530064
i see the imprudence of it .-- oh ! : 24.80289683323307
_that_ abominable mr . : 24.03257144898492
darcy !-- my father ' s opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and i should be miserable to forfeit it . : 11.740916530139174
my father , however , is partial to mr . : 22.295155829564766
in short , my dear aunt , i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted , or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ? : 9.648867530113673
all that i can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry . : 25.479661093489266
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object . : 15.655349161853042
when i am in company with him , i will not be wishing . : 19.825730237776153
at least , you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him ." " as i did the other day ," said elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; " very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_ . : 11.732682365127753
but do not imagine that he is always here so often . : 22.575285546165457
it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . : 15.262570044519661
you know my mother ' s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends . : 16.838736433391762
collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane ; but as he took up his abode with the lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs . : 12.784319325213797
his marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill - natured tone that she " _wished_ they might be happy ." thursday was to be the wedding day , and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , elizabeth , ashamed of her mother ' s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room . : 10.457834926895018
as they went down stairs together , charlotte said , " i shall depend on hearing from you very often , eliza ." " _that_ you certainly shall ." " and i have another favour to ask . : 11.629175941716117
will you come and see me ?" " we shall often meet , i hope , in hertfordshire ." " i am not likely to leave kent for some time . : 14.966280068300888
promise me , therefore , to come to hunsford ." elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit . : 13.861641463078932
" my father and maria are to come to me in march ," added charlotte , " and i hope you will consent to be of the party . : 16.194805284006176
elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible . : 12.676311522311567
elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was . : 11.943102996888326
charlotte ' s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like lady catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen . : 11.126198878947402
she wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise . : 12.226911986564561
it was mr . : 50.4151034275179
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london ; and when she wrote again , elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys . : 14.021418293369793
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is . : 12.143642946366912
jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from caroline . : 13.521145520616292
" my aunt ," she continued , " is going to - morrow into that part of the town , and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor - street ." she wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen miss bingley . : 11.945195174043404
" i did not think caroline in spirits ," were her words , " but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london . : 12.631494294580722
i was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her . : 14.486682875541206
he was well , but so much engaged with mr . : 24.711280088007744
darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him . : 26.186943742096968
i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner . : 28.53478213499631
my visit was not long , as caroline and mrs . : 24.037179868063188
hurst were going out . : 17.872426944058148
i dare say i shall soon see them here ." elizabeth shook her head over this letter . : 11.121240060472891
it convinced her , that accident only could discover to mr . : 15.164820268718215
bingley her sister ' s being in town . : 25.30395611863063
four weeks passed away , and jane saw nothing of him . : 18.75107525426931
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley ' s inattention . : 13.096107650023155
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow jane to deceive herself no longer . : 12.576984281669924
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt . : 21.5018371701265
" my dearest lizzy will , i am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expence , when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley ' s regard for me . : 10.698052309172368
i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , i am sure i should be deceived again . : 13.6952849457103
when she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . : 12.19459761874031
she was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; i can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side . : 11.759874053115617
but i pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . : 16.62288462039158
i need not explain myself farther ; and though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable . : 11.548161140133383
i cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago . : 13.76441993205999
he knows of my being in town , i am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy . : 13.492214795692087
i cannot understand it . : 34.956489444301745
if i were not afraid of judging harshly , i should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . : 11.74942592541926
but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . : 12.616995553798173
let me hear from you very soon . : 13.55360522351294
we had better not mention it . : 22.16102241763745
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford . : 10.611929636926613
pray go to see them , with sir william and maria . : 22.532297313022823
i am sure you will be very comfortable there . : 18.14396828609907
" your ' s , & c ." this letter gave elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least . : 10.101638296631506
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over . : 21.920901850798163
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions . : 20.171930071315426
his character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr . : 10.602049985687819
darcy ' s sister , as , by wickham ' s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away . : 17.135710625040584
gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself . : 9.733439872459359
his apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else . : 11.483036866308222
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain . : 15.716051770709523
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ; but elizabeth , less clear - sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte ' s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence . : 10.972505005653554
nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy . : 9.780501355174582
gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on :--" i am now convinced , my dear aunt , that i have never been much in love ; for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion , i should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil . : 9.430891631133598
but my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_ ; they are even impartial towards miss king . : 10.176216386944128
there can be no love in all this . : 20.029303204026334
my watchfulness has been effectual ; and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were i distractedly in love with him , i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance . : 13.36911245293209
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly . : 9.10128087898757
they are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain ." chapter iv . : 11.981388089647687
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family , and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did january and february pass away . : 7.720790514946739
march was to take elizabeth to hunsford . : 19.240077009672742
she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty . : 10.7485778648015
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of mr . : 8.726333762392223
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay . : 13.308474632755585
every thing , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to charlotte ' s first sketch . : 12.269593973960474
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be . : 11.179523429112272
the only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter . : 16.116075943645175
the farewell between herself and mr . : 22.440284381825105
wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more . : 12.92206240610997
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her -- their opinion of every body -- would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . : 9.914148624873246
her fellow - travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable . : 13.963953732896242
sir william lucas , and his daughter maria , a good humoured girl , but as empty - headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise . : 11.17863117848429
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out like his information . : 10.948618923579014
it was a journey of only twenty - four miles , and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch - street by noon . : 10.155111292921939
as they drove to mr . : 21.572785699727284
gardiner ' s door , jane was at a drawing - room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever . : 10.274901022425354
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin ' s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing - room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower . : 9.42162068008813
the day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres . : 12.310909530766876
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt . : 22.8244796801999
gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley ' s visit in gracechurch - street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance . : 10.875932174283976
gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham ' s desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well . : 10.656689901347148
" but , my dear elizabeth ," she added , " what sort of girl is miss king ? : 13.449250539198731
i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary ." " pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? : 10.399688945648803
where does discretion end , and avarice begin ? : 17.112795975524637
last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary ." " if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is , i shall know what to think ." " she is a very good kind of girl , i believe . : 12.595348482563567
i know no harm of her ." " but he paid her not the smallest attention , till her grandfather ' s death made her mistress of this fortune ." " no -- why should he ? : 11.729988763841186
if it was not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections , because i had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ?" " but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event ." " a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe . : 9.651151814290243
if _she_ does not object to it , why should _we_ ?" " _her_ not objecting , does not justify _him_ . : 11.253215054271646
it only shews her being deficient in something herself -- sense or feeling ." " well ," cried elizabeth , " have it as you choose . : 10.793956159290602
_he_ shall be mercenary , and _she_ shall be foolish ." " no , lizzy , that is what i do _not_ choose . : 15.406221081921673
if that is all , i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better . : 13.935532390470687
i am sick of them all . : 28.3442890716113
thank heaven ! : 29.486818629760783
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all ." " take care , lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment ." before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer . : 8.794149342917471
gardiner , " but perhaps to the lakes ." no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful . : 13.33687037007848
" my dear , dear aunt ," she rapturously cried , " what delight ! : 14.344897709193056
what felicity ! : 92.25528954835815
you give me fresh life and vigour . : 15.3005709082906
what are men to rocks and mountains ? : 11.316935451350114
what hours of transport we shall spend ! : 19.019766816508085
and when we _do_ return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing . : 13.308034713112475
we _will_ know where we have gone -- we _will_ recollect what we have seen . : 11.884868099797439
lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation . : 6.566503192323735
let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers ." chapter v . : 6.7149477705235405
every object in the next day ' s journey was new and interesting to elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight . : 11.40837411320126
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford , every eye was in search of the parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view . : 12.193552988602875
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side . : 11.965826569951282
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants . : 21.13781385941788
at length the parsonage was discernible . : 17.901361004032463
the garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , every thing declared they were arriving . : 14.531403318835403
collins and charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party . : 10.747614777872352
in a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other . : 15.718465829253148
collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received . : 13.391864652512508
she saw instantly that her cousin ' s manners were not altered by his marriage ; his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family . : 10.723474325974937
they were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife ' s offers of refreshment . : 10.87449676092817
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him . : 10.379024973422407
but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion . : 9.934363836274322
collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte . : 10.779480366540794
once or twice she could discern a faint blush ; but in general charlotte wisely did not hear . : 10.213656161971711
after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london , mr . : 11.70495848708397
collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself . : 11.998629273446324
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible . : 11.85460235144777
here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind . : 6.015423849625863
it was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground . : 10.609622829576493
from his garden , mr . : 23.063144581004373
collins would have led them round his two meadows , but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back ; and while sir william accompanied him , charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband ' s help . : 9.07418952010754
it was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit . : 9.817911583299493
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country . : 18.966171350355737
collins joining in , observed , " yes , miss elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church , and i need not say you will be delighted with her . : 13.179230926576407
she is all affability and condescension , and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . : 12.438133331550079
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . : 9.51490313425462
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming . : 28.448611889789877
we dine at rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . : 13.461711548309891
she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference ." the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte ' s degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well . : 9.61740031267412
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of mr . : 7.608721134880656
collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings . : 16.987829908328187
a lively imagination soon settled it all . : 18.503732391713527
about the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her . : 11.339154514444198
she opened the door , and met maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , " oh , my dear eliza ! : 12.699723260288085
pray make haste and come into the dining - room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! : 13.792269731682874
i will not tell you what it is . : 32.751299388199136
make haste , and come down this moment ." elizabeth asked questions in vain ; maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining - room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate . : 9.476748242980138
" and is this all ?" cried elizabeth . : 20.62641595513711
my dear ," said maria quite shocked at the mistake , " it is not lady catherine . : 14.410150643401682
the old lady is mrs . : 26.736014642362846
jenkinson , who lives with them . : 17.964783305248094
the other is miss de bourgh . : 26.607302391902973
only look at her . : 40.480454150266446
she is quite a little creature . : 36.11672820769183
who would have thought she could be so thin and small !" " she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind . : 10.761466203077317
why does she not come in ?" " oh ! : 14.728100014397896
charlotte says , she hardly ever does . : 24.44116014278235
it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in ." " i like her appearance ," said elizabeth , struck with other ideas . : 9.598702066185131
" she looks sickly and cross .-- yes , she will do for him very well . : 14.789654249856579
collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and sir william , to elizabeth ' s high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way . : 11.176867945988398
at length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house . : 17.194526486856713
collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day . : 8.681498177161922
" i confess ," said he , " that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship ' s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings . : 11.325336767926082
i rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen . : 22.713767036227704
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? : 21.720738732864252
about the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon ." scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to rosings . : 9.840364066429645
collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them . : 11.587674479101905
when the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to elizabeth , " do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel . : 10.70091480324829
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter . : 8.753935426036032
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed . : 14.297793473647898
she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved ." while they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner .-- such formidable accounts of her ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened maria lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at st . : 10.173755403012548
as the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park .-- every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as mr . : 9.732675025451275
when they ascended the steps to the hall , maria ' s alarm was every moment increasing , and even sir william did not look perfectly calm .-- elizabeth ' s courage did not fail her . : 10.524864844525318
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank , she thought she could witness without trepidation . : 8.083458881311818
from the entrance hall , of which mr . : 21.666086738905378
collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti - chamber , to the room where lady catherine , her daughter , and mrs . : 9.889157285837843
jenkinson were sitting .-- her ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as mrs . : 9.9434259256723
in spite of having been at st . : 23.119894024912895
james ' s , sir william was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look . : 10.231410350124243
she was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self - importance , and brought mr . : 11.901879565612264
wickham immediately to elizabeth ' s mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented . : 18.25324700652349
when , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr . : 10.196342656447465
darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in maria ' s astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small . : 16.024409843919194
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to mrs . : 9.796023188896921
jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes . : 10.970436185553888
after sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , mr . : 12.739224703938147
collins attending them to point out its beauties , and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer . : 11.978150946222083
the dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which mr . : 17.371527411942303
collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyship ' s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater .-- he carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by sir william , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said , in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear . : 9.715435021499117
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them . : 8.945715219669058
the party did not supply much conversation . : 27.881185213370387
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh -- the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time . : 10.512273985926424
when the ladies returned to the drawing - room , there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted . : 10.170210918394009
she enquired into charlotte ' s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her ' s , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry . : 11.616812646925123
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady ' s attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others . : 10.735132952183042
in the intervals of her discourse with mrs . : 18.567775920048344
collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl . : 15.54945835228664
she asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother ' s maiden name ?-- elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly .-- lady catherine then observed , " your father ' s estate is entailed on mr . : 10.92890566073367
collins , i think . : 56.38654453364164
then -- some time or other we shall be happy to hear you . : 17.69763997192546
our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to ---- you shall try it some day .-- do your sisters play and sing ?" " one of them does ." " why did not you all learn ?-- you ought all to have learned . : 8.748642648666568
but i suppose you had no opportunity . : 30.185468653561237
how was that possible ? : 33.34288107611229
five daughters brought up at home without a governess !-- i never heard of such a thing . : 11.488343449296819
" then , who taught you ? : 39.2833863510967
who attended to you ? : 56.74135407076197
we were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary . : 15.181216676901025
those who chose to be idle , certainly might ." " aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if i had known your mother , i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one . : 10.547891182290538
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . : 10.596141020576216
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way . : 11.742028118270182
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out . : 14.344521190912952
four nieces of mrs . : 18.11909426307504
jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that i recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . : 10.096707602516153
collins , did i tell you of lady metcalfe ' s calling yesterday to thank me ? : 11.841782204371775
she finds miss pope a treasure . : 15.662668899335573
' lady catherine ,' said she , ' you have given me a treasure .' are any of your younger sisters out , miss bennet ?" " yes , ma ' am , all ." " all !-- what , all five out at once ? : 10.706331221390434
very odd !-- and you only the second .-- the younger ones out before the elder are married !-- your younger sisters must be very young ?" " yes , my youngest is not sixteen . : 10.727870048929791
perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company . : 15.673616128145998
and to be kept back on _such_ a motive !-- i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind ." " upon my word ," said her ladyship , " you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person .-- pray , what is your age ?" " with three younger sisters grown up ," replied elizabeth smiling , " your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it ." lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence . : 8.551020328393003
collins sat down to quadrille ; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs . : 10.147688463180343
jenkinson to make up her party . : 17.153753582524736
their table was superlatively stupid . : 17.595778069287352
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when mrs . : 10.32030451183013
jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh ' s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light . : 8.604731009563885
a great deal more passed at the other table . : 19.080835988707854
lady catherine was generally speaking -- stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself . : 8.653210745677672
collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many . : 10.261129662028782
sir william did not say much . : 22.114045264581218
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names . : 8.683834671734658
collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered . : 19.409553523936168
the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow . : 13.891632552801356
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr . : 13.067409506559063
collins ' s side , and as many bows on sir william ' s , they departed . : 13.969553896109463
as soon as they had driven from the door , elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings , which , for charlotte ' s sake , she made more favourable than it really was . : 14.146305364688672
but her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy mr . : 10.959708947235459
collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship ' s praise into his own hands . : 15.614895560936557
sir william staid only a week at hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter ' s being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with . : 11.645639496699678
while sir william was with them , mr . : 14.34593367607092
collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road . : 11.397519067535736
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining - parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for mr . : 10.033808237261603
collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement . : 13.054960608314074
collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day . : 10.802595251307746
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage , and had a few minutes ' conversation with charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out . : 12.800941129914714
very few days passed in which mr . : 20.185580699608025
collins did not walk to rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours . : 12.23259696186282
now and then , they were honoured with a call from her ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits . : 12.505211643457296
she examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs . : 9.48864848992233
collins ' s joints of meat were too large for her family . : 10.668750713740483
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr . : 12.138259650261793
collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty . : 7.5651495080809275
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of sir william , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first . : 10.855313294842237
their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the collinses ' reach . : 12.171454989008796
this however was no evil to elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors . : 11.550694529211913
her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine ' s curiosity . : 9.674795570014702
in this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away . : 17.219637980017065
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that mr . : 20.39484687907127
darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley ' s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself . : 10.541220948710162
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage , for mr . : 17.284721438081995
collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great intelligence . : 9.445259837876852
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects . : 9.52597197148817
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them , for mr . : 11.591488330288435
darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party , when mr . : 16.440659793926788
collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him . : 19.156198236591557
charlotte had seen them from her husband ' s room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , " i may thank you , eliza , for this piece of civility . : 11.976650662266383
darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me ." elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door - bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room . : 9.710639341985521
colonel fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman . : 11.574861035147537
collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure . : 16.446805158290374
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word . : 16.570703591968257
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well - bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs . : 8.99420169954401
collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body . : 12.565104784304905
at length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family . : 13.006203548578997
she answered him in the usual way , and after a moment ' s pause , added , " my eldest sister has been in town these three months . : 16.526057752288065
have you never happened to see her there ?" she was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet . : 11.393639333940472
the subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away . : 15.22309274760943
colonel fitzwilliam ' s manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings . : 13.250743162034706
it was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till easter - day , almost a week after the gentlemen ' s arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening . : 10.994374139164599
for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter . : 16.871242094536342
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but mr . : 12.810436644877658
darcy they had only seen at church . : 25.062195582384824
the invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine ' s drawing - room . : 11.679568395190634
her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to darcy , much more than to any other person in the room . : 10.880901741701823
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings ; and mrs . : 12.958543831890422
collins ' s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much . : 9.634831674365088
_his_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , " what is that you are saying , fitzwilliam ? : 12.174586833151645
what is it you are talking of ? : 25.439889096610976
what are you telling miss bennet ? : 28.09210036471041
let me hear what it is ." " we are speaking of music , madam ," said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply . : 12.633386893360782
" of music ! : 74.54945839806383
it is of all subjects my delight . : 22.122319620566966
i must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music . : 21.684837637763575
there are few people in england , i suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste . : 10.335867994125442
if i had ever learnt , i should have been a great proficient . : 19.91272409994573
i am confident that she would have performed delightfully . : 18.574240096293316
how does georgiana get on , darcy ?" mr . : 14.542036832941726
darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister ' s proficiency . : 16.301186850458247
" i am very glad to hear such a good account of her ," said lady catherine ; " and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal ." " i assure you , madam ," he replied , " that she does not need such advice . : 11.788446712201017
she practises very constantly ." " so much the better . : 17.147120072949985
i often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice . : 12.97361738163583
i have told miss bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though mrs . : 12.599314187989377
collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as i have often told her , to come to rosings every day , and play on the piano - forte in mrs . : 15.18410911937574
darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt ' s ill breeding , and made no answer . : 16.41238288195937
he drew a chair near her . : 20.957594724403545
lady catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano - forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ' s countenance . : 9.879779530055018
elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said , " you mean to frighten me , mr . : 15.390455892816712
darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ? : 17.905871596820525
but i will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well . : 11.648519364757828
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others . : 12.301371732354422
my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me ." " i shall not say that you are mistaken ," he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own ." elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to colonel fitzwilliam , " your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word i say . : 10.080662348944172
i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . : 10.95831235076053
indeed , mr . : 25.241933596367453
darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire -- and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too -- for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear ." " i am not afraid of you ," said he , smilingly . : 10.315249387812065
" i should like to know how he behaves among strangers ." " you shall hear then -- but prepare yourself for something very dreadful . : 9.64028897655139
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball -- and at this ball , what do you think he did ? : 17.585309396378083
he danced only four dances ! : 22.122813286207617
he danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . : 11.403950742316272
darcy , you cannot deny the fact ." " i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party ." " true ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room . : 12.445095895965574
well , colonel fitzwilliam , what do i play next ? : 14.75659466262893
my fingers wait your orders ." " perhaps ," said darcy , " i should have judged better , had i sought an introduction , but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers ." " shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ?" said elizabeth , still addressing colonel fitzwilliam . : 9.320897095221087
" shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ?" " i can answer your question ," said fitzwilliam , " without applying to him . : 10.323336739974515
i cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as i often see done ." " my fingers ," said elizabeth , " do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women ' s do . : 11.018441539861747
they have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . : 18.79830197506972
but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault -- because i would not take the trouble of practising . : 14.29267837004417
it is not that i do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman ' s of superior execution ." darcy smiled and said , " you are perfectly right . : 9.696682473772968
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting . : 16.8814516967041
we neither of us perform to strangers ." here they were interrupted by lady catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of . : 11.895606188727966
elizabeth immediately began playing again . : 21.662985690736836
she has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to anne ' s . : 12.70058068208654
anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn ." elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ' s praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_ , had she been his relation . : 9.935290007570131
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth ' s performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste . : 7.1817735885191825
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship ' s carriage was ready to take them all home . : 13.460002681379196
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to jane , while mrs . : 15.518754491245918
collins and maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor . : 12.349753939760044
as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half - finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , mr . : 10.345207383591955
darcy , and mr . : 29.301123942218524
darcy only , entered the room . : 20.641937247723707
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within . : 13.989984750195099
they then sat down , and when her enquiries after rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence . : 9.595843972355269
it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , " how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr . : 10.508979458830344
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr . : 18.880090950595115
he and his sisters were well , i hope , when you left london ." " perfectly so -- i thank you ." she found that she was to receive no other answer -- and , after a short pause , added , " i think i have understood that mr . : 12.730891007543962
he has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing ." " if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there . : 10.476304676424649
but perhaps mr . : 46.141995429724005
bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle ." " i should not be surprised ," said darcy , " if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers ." elizabeth made no answer . : 13.236811434699554
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him . : 13.929571709930126
he took the hint , and soon began with , " this seems a very comfortable house . : 15.262070983818342
lady catherine , i believe , did a great deal to it when mr . : 13.13526774185053
collins first came to hunsford ." " i believe she did -- and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object ." " mr . : 11.66456583490393
collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife ." " yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . : 11.891283198802993
my friend has an excellent understanding -- though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr . : 12.21013704035841
collins as the wisest thing she ever did . : 15.905452378531814
she seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her ." " it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends ." " an easy distance do you call it ? : 12.50468729206731
it is nearly fifty miles ." " and what is fifty miles of good road ? : 13.731237680568055
little more than half a day ' s journey . : 24.388906702184087
yes , i call it a _very_ easy distance ." " i should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match ," cried elizabeth . : 11.933639833303673
" i should never have said mrs . : 21.011860065690378
collins was settled _near_ her family ." " it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire . : 13.710363755330707
any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far ." as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . : 11.950300548530084
the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances . : 18.00095065887451
where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil . : 8.397039677141368
collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys -- and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance ." mr . : 8.08467205637212
darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , " _you_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment . : 12.633887929771278
_you_ cannot have been always at longbourn ." elizabeth looked surprised . : 18.756598525561675
the gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , " are you pleased with kent ?" a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise -- and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk . : 9.489056622237744
the tête - à - tête surprised them . : 12.003167688178777
" my dear eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way ." but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte ' s wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year . : 11.707366989122955
all field sports were over . : 21.074915345264632
they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt . : 12.742839013740834
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam ' s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind . : 12.034229084154036
darcy came so often to the parsonage , it was more difficult to understand . : 20.720581134478266
it could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice -- a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself . : 10.043674414540966
colonel fitzwilliam ' s occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out .-- she watched him whenever they were at rosings , and whenever he came to hunsford ; but without much success . : 11.563089760024438
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable . : 14.251066075509696
it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind . : 9.72656884008138
collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend ' s dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power . : 11.337166360548082
in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam . : 14.50512837618281
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , mr . : 10.807772878285594
darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all . : 16.136587279180276
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet mr . : 9.831613784257513
darcy .-- she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers .-- how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd !-- yet it did , and even a third . : 8.626916492710244
it seemed like wilful ill - nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her . : 9.415075663712514
his words seemed to imply it . : 21.88206762392413
she supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter . : 15.087839130190567
it distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage . : 15.754785074579397
she was engaged one day as she walked , in re - perusing jane ' s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr . : 10.807598538810694
darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her . : 10.076933524769457
are you going much farther ?" " no , i should have turned in a moment ." and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together . : 12.338355330746003
" do you certainly leave kent on saturday ?" said she . : 15.338384645276616
" yes -- if darcy does not put it off again . : 14.030746848275236
but i am at his disposal . : 25.777861171105
he arranges the business just as he pleases ." " and if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice . : 15.040151798319052
i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr . : 9.829313111620092
darcy ." " he likes to have his own way very well ," replied colonel fitzwilliam . : 20.264491426285115
" but so we all do . : 26.237181593866545
i speak feelingly . : 53.35579586565866
now , seriously , what have you ever known of self - denial and dependence ? : 10.22914649255941
but in matters of greater weight , i may suffer from the want of money . : 13.441165328212302
younger sons cannot marry where they like ." " unless where they like women of fortune , which i think they very often do ." " our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money ." " is this ," thought elizabeth , " meant for me ?" and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , " and pray , what is the usual price of an earl ' s younger son ? : 9.421337897982882
unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds ." he answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped . : 11.817300973337575
to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , " i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal . : 8.96431347891276
i wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind . : 14.215317874246008
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy ." " are you , indeed ? : 23.338893428927435
and pray what sort of guardians do you make ? : 20.03965720223407
does your charge give you much trouble ? : 17.08894964887139
young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way ." as she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth . : 10.20951727630989
she directly replied , " you need not be frightened . : 23.674579328276305
i never heard any harm of her ; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world . : 12.877456437991986
she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , mrs . : 17.559626793646235
hurst and miss bingley . : 20.063568313575217
i think i have heard you say that you know them ." " i know them a little . : 22.39498476892071
their brother is a pleasant gentleman - like man -- he is a great friend of darcy ' s ." " oh ! : 12.048051825750758
yes ," said elizabeth drily --" mr . : 14.35480316943436
darcy is uncommonly kind to mr . : 17.892815315031953
from something that he told me in our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him . : 14.015247536802445
it was all conjecture ." " what is it you mean ?" " it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady ' s family , it would be an unpleasant thing ." " you may depend upon my not mentioning it ." " and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley . : 11.524724508432522
what he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer ." " did mr . : 10.31499457587383
darcy give you his reasons for this interference ?" " i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady ." " and what arts did he use to separate them ?" " he did not talk to me of his own arts ," said fitzwilliam smiling . : 10.630768824383235
" he only told me , what i have now told you ." elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation . : 14.577685681998268
after watching her a little , fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful . : 14.61281612878956
" i am thinking of what you have been telling me ," said she . : 17.350625828653584
" your cousin ' s conduct does not suit my feelings . : 18.673081077686838
why was he to be the judge ?" " you are rather disposed to call his interference officious ?" " i do not see what right mr . : 10.57115256938333
darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ' s inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy ." " but ," she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . : 12.365708350999975
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case ." " that is not an unnatural surmise ," said fitzwilliam , " but it is lessening the honour of my cousin ' s triumph very sadly ." this was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr . : 11.224180687068031
there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard . : 13.270608516862545
there could not exist in the world _two_ men , over whom mr . : 12.693760675355328
darcy could have such boundless influence . : 24.14602036898373
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr . : 14.182958751144861
bingley and jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them . : 12.261303022075223
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted . : 10.750881585029662
" there were some very strong objections against the lady ," were colonel fitzwilliam ' s words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in london . : 11.058387411873536
all loveliness and goodness as she is ! : 27.439676215138018
her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating . : 19.5421355360251
neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which mr . : 9.62301370646271
darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach ." when she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with mr . : 11.040146750783794
darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ' s connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining mr . : 11.361850435273974
bingley for his sister . : 41.79707392821928
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr . : 11.971991515110908
darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea . : 12.479755440382203
collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but mr . : 13.506475545838605
collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine ' s being rather displeased by her staying at home . : 11.014568844868744
when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr . : 12.07916435108818
darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent . : 13.081625868842371
they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering . : 6.793769801551033
but in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded . : 11.842691161125632
elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal . : 12.898981820410732
darcy ' s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister ' s sufferings . : 11.031493594037563
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do . : 12.967468633532103
she could not think of darcy ' s leaving kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him . : 14.334460513940186
while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her . : 11.870498898947176
but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr . : 14.765706636686756
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better . : 11.003498160221724
she answered him with cold civility . : 27.45420323706625
elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word . : 19.900194139135003
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , " in vain have i struggled . : 12.719030214798273
it will not do . : 50.07195747783806
my feelings will not be repressed . : 29.881551873017454
she stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent . : 16.41851786074545
this he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed . : 14.750620495744492
he spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride . : 13.821501835404364
his sense of her inferiority -- of its being a degradation -- of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit . : 9.982953613584254
in spite of her deeply - rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man ' s affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger . : 10.24047760501921
she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done . : 16.072237612781677
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand . : 11.23888910238297
as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer . : 19.16385578394497
it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could _feel_ gratitude , i would now thank you . : 15.507193750618892
but i cannot -- i have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . : 13.365359548677974
the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation ." mr . : 10.659459311542037
darcy , who was leaning against the mantle - piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise . : 8.644283447211306
his complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature . : 13.058467072239026
he was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it . : 11.863765033892292
at length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , " and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting ! : 14.235387522523801
i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little _endeavour_ at civility , i am thus rejected . : 14.346683468455543
but it is of small importance ." " i might as well enquire ," replied she , " why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? : 10.52944395467374
was not this some excuse for incivility , if i _was_ uncivil ? : 12.423549593863994
but i have other provocations . : 28.95148294413938
you know i have . : 76.68770862930586
had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ?" as she pronounced these words , mr . : 9.769118768699762
" i have every reason in the world to think ill of you . : 19.377302095577885
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_ . : 6.8340718283023865
you dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind ." she paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse . : 9.040311662542246
" can you deny that you have done it ?" she repeated . : 19.511648069140133
with assumed tranquillity he then replied , " i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that i rejoice in my success . : 12.545035478510895
towards _him_ i have been kinder than towards myself ." elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her . : 8.304103842632012
" but it is not merely this affair ," she continued , " on which my dislike is founded . : 11.80086149212899
long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided . : 18.37477678035775
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr . : 12.289150160309717
on this subject , what can you have to say ? : 31.731863464483123
in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? : 11.157092058775646
or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ?" " you take an eager interest in that gentleman ' s concerns ," said darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour . : 10.55098324017723
" who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ?" " his misfortunes !" repeated darcy contemptuously ; " yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed ." " and of your infliction ," cried elizabeth with energy . : 10.748052675496673
" you have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty . : 13.891965437066524
you have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him . : 15.94590609749874
you have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert . : 14.829426150741213
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule ." " and this ," cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , " is your opinion of me ! : 11.559656105682254
this is the estimation in which you hold me ! : 17.038405704967747
i thank you for explaining it so fully . : 18.44200050240834
my faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed ! : 12.116525091837007
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . : 18.506364610347195
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related . : 21.2611371233761
they were natural and just . : 25.504945597394585
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ? : 20.057393383512913
to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ?" elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , " you are mistaken , mr . : 9.285426270370552
darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman - like manner ." she saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , " you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it ." again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification . : 11.120505226956892
she went on . : 69.55115520309992
" from the very beginning , from the first moment i may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground - work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry ." " you have said quite enough , madam . : 10.453989563307664
i perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . : 24.00874821547217
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness ." and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house . : 9.231463859643126
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great . : 26.83612434850076
her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it . : 13.462482308983212
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend ' s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible ! : 13.184764368088718
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection . : 12.344801221876866
but his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr . : 11.339337500665113
wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited . : 10.36407576132014
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine ' s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte ' s observation , and hurried her away to her room . : 10.797666453013179
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise . : 10.414667973376444
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of mr . : 15.962294246802148
darcy ' s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road . : 11.183881189960935
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park . : 11.869682129090435
she was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being mr . : 9.630206321582023
darcy , she was directly retreating . : 26.184641037330795
but the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name . : 11.30600147754212
she had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be mr . : 16.122904844325284
darcy , she moved again towards the gate . : 19.931957653256255
he had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you . : 11.1240503408392
will you do me the honour of reading that letter ?"-- and then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight . : 11.667182528439625
with no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand .-- the envelope itself was likewise full .-- pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it . : 7.688779001588211
i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . : 11.39580308683868
you must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention ; your feelings , i know , will bestow it unwillingly , but i demand it of your justice . : 11.123856652239866
" two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge . : 12.87630226049589
bingley from your sister ,-- and the other , that i had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of mr . : 9.637953771817925
wickham .-- wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison .-- but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read .-- if , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your ' s , i can only say that i am sorry .-- the necessity must be obeyed -- and farther apology would be absurd .-- i had not been long in hertfordshire , before i saw , in common with others , that bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country .-- but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment .-- i had often seen him in love before .-- at that ball , while i had the honour of dancing with you , i was first made acquainted , by sir william lucas ' s accidental information , that bingley ' s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage . : 10.13858636060766
from that moment i observed my friend ' s behaviour attentively ; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him . : 12.021026706821482
your sister i also watched .-- her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remained convinced from the evening ' s scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .-- if _you_ have not been mistaken here , _i_ must have been in an error . : 9.15874349440084
your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable .-- if it be so , if i have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . : 13.008746052452898
but i shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister ' s countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched .-- that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain ,-- but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears .-- i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it ;-- i believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as i wished it in reason .-- my objections to the marriage were not merely those , which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me .-- but there were other causes of repugnance ;-- causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me .-- these causes must be stated , though briefly .-- the situation of your mother ' s family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father .-- pardon me .-- it pains me to offend you . : 8.424492209572799
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .-- i will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection .-- he left netherfield for london , on the day following , as you , i am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning .-- the part which i acted , is now to be explained .-- his sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london .-- we accordingly went -- and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice .-- i described , and enforced them earnestly .-- but , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving , of your sister ' s indifference . : 9.389924754829842
he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard .-- but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own .-- to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point . : 9.701259757524475
to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment .-- i cannot blame myself for having done thus much . : 12.243365124291065
i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it .-- that they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ;-- but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger .-- perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me .-- it is done , however , and it was done for the best .-- on this subject i have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer . : 11.517913245076034
if i have wounded your sister ' s feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them .-- with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured mr . : 8.273770347134352
wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . : 12.873638789243254
of what he has _particularly_ accused me i am ignorant ; but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity . : 13.230208233361585
my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge ;-- most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ' s education . : 11.487408724314559
as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner . : 17.646954281706982
the vicious propensities -- the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr . : 10.572421722852095
darcy could not have . : 62.009851193798156
here again i shall give you pain -- to what degree you only can tell . : 11.000433983860338
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr . : 18.6544535337813
wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character . : 9.622622682690315
my excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to mr . : 12.012133857811811
wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant . : 11.429039149383208
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds . : 11.936038126345071
his own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , mr . : 13.23349994038021
i knew that mr . : 33.79420162662446
wickham ought not to be a clergyman . : 27.826115261708757
the business was therefore soon settled . : 26.289166448878348
he resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds . : 13.313363129242937
all connection between us seemed now dissolved . : 14.860407326926431
for about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation . : 14.300596958722988
his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad . : 19.3725749054849
he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question -- of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father ' s intentions . : 11.466340478926671
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it . : 8.490970751296699
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances -- and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself . : 15.666409855010599
after this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt . : 12.930852250223268
how he lived i know not . : 21.670451646111477
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . : 14.36806252157008
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being . : 11.602462043279989
having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy . : 16.560971706030248
my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother ' s nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself . : 16.36075218842491
about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went mr . : 12.510602454773489
wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs . : 9.262004535252636
younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement . : 10.332180945734788
she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself . : 12.909159114584444
i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me . : 8.979362181045007
wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs . : 20.70873809379063
younge was of course removed from her charge . : 15.038111653196482
wickham ' s chief object was unquestionably my sister ' s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement . : 10.503058087041515
this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr . : 9.838638050626379
i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at . : 14.187070981073648
ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination . : 13.745994133771497
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night . : 14.822060890005785
but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . : 14.829845614700957
for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father ' s will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions . : 9.789532791015791
if your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . : 9.826911859023163
i will only add , god bless you . : 13.180441587001695
" fitzwilliam darcy ." chapter xiii . : 25.882076799761396
if elizabeth , when mr . : 43.958796266641656
darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents . : 14.202904087275758
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined . : 24.619191267019982
she read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes . : 11.617614072046354
he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty . : 12.420406859017556
it was all pride and insolence . : 22.325941279564244
wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition . : 8.902001063061672
astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her . : 12.652072568791572
she wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " this must be false ! : 12.874913392969532
this cannot be ! : 80.47536808697289
this must be the grossest falsehood !"-- and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again . : 11.95412991091086
in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence . : 11.554139110554162
the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late mr . : 20.80907382474948
darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words . : 11.394212440938293
so far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great . : 13.995363068081295
what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err . : 12.520306390842826
she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality -- deliberated on the probability of each statement -- but with little success . : 10.246244913611052
on both sides it was only assertion . : 23.89509632169538
again she read on . : 33.0839493401649
but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render mr . : 9.95914099617644
darcy ' s conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole . : 12.097061256088002
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr . : 11.525417178892345
wickham ' s charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice . : 12.519952847732888
she had never heard of him before his entrance into the ---- shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance . : 12.220726026176003
as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring . : 16.362088749164283
his countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue . : 23.24390306571172
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of mr . : 6.4756055015814304
darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what mr . : 8.96840820332036
darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance . : 10.562932234017653
but no such recollection befriended her . : 17.207174334783527
she could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess . : 11.449455296001533
after pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read . : 13.677850633480643
the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself -- from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin ' s affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question . : 11.1817468651617
darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin ' s corroboration . : 13.960225111313736
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself , in their first evening at mr . : 14.739328017781242
philips ' s . : 34.39804697781587
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory . : 18.59913406363387
she was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before . : 13.747619490270111
darcy -- that mr . : 34.013964842274184
darcy might leave the country , but that _he_ should stand his ground ; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week . : 9.470188510527574
she remembered also , that till the netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking mr . : 9.984218758462102
darcy ' s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son . : 15.784271502464438
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned ! : 14.788712884523378
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing . : 9.379208367042528
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn . : 10.347887204012089
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther justification of mr . : 7.708614027521515
bingley , when questioned by jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ; that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust -- any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits . : 8.730491796009124
that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued -- that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling . : 9.895751807835007
bingley , was incomprehensible . : 48.83308738594566
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself .-- of neither darcy nor wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd . : 7.907993892397718
" how despicably have i acted !" she cried .--" i , who have prided myself on my discernment !-- i , who have valued myself on my abilities ! : 9.177251832150155
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust .-- how humiliating is this discovery !-- yet , how just a humiliation !-- had i been in love , i could not have been more wretchedly blind . : 8.288656887991165
but vanity , not love , has been my folly .-- pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , i have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned . : 12.627082687834879
till this moment , i never knew myself ." from herself to jane -- from jane to bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr . : 11.732582635462759
darcy ' s explanation _there_ , had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again . : 13.707508965281239
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe . : 12.734635716353077
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers . : 11.643114234850998
it soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self - attracted by the rest of her family ;-- and as she considered that jane ' s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before . : 10.915780038571448
after wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ; re - considering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation . : 8.780729826691577
darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found .-- elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him ; she really rejoiced at it . : 11.14118501646935
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning ; and mr . : 13.934203355662852
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship ' s indignation would have been . : 13.069033783431648
" what would she have said ?-- how would she have behaved ?" were questions with which she amused herself . : 8.428442249444425
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party .--" i assure you , i feel it exceedingly ," said lady catherine ; " i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do . : 11.455464906299063
but i am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me !-- they were excessively sorry to go ! : 14.805619336747752
but so they always are . : 26.592807816253654
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more i think than last year . : 9.994954374103854
his attachment to rosings , certainly increases ." mr . : 12.922815807410737
lady catherine observed , after dinner , that miss bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , " but if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . : 13.88761804034352
collins will be very glad of your company , i am sure ." " i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation ," replied elizabeth , " but it is not in my power to accept it .-- i must be in town next saturday ." " why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . : 12.960431309662022
i told mrs . : 51.673162577646366
collins so before you came . : 27.51683284684115
there can be no occasion for your going so soon . : 15.841455477777972
your father of course may spare you , if your mother can .-- daughters are never of so much consequence to a father . : 13.100974417116838
and if you will stay another _month_ complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london , for i am going there early in june , for a week ; and as dawson does not object to the barouche box , there will be very good room for one of you -- and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , i should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large ." " you are all kindness , madam ; but i believe we must abide by our original plan ." lady catherine seemed resigned . : 10.312138735984481
" mrs . : 93.18839550989752
collins , you must send a servant with them . : 16.771760520121674
you know i always speak my mind , and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . : 11.889391704819227
it is highly improper . : 31.35033609459879
you must contrive to send somebody . : 21.96726524961588
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing .-- young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life . : 8.404342568505978
when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer , i made a point of her having two men servants go with her .-- miss darcy , the daughter of mr . : 11.6185813649147
darcy , of pemberley , and lady anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner .-- i am excessively attentive to all those things . : 13.105077005756517
you must send john with the young ladies , mrs . : 14.736191282527502
where shall you change horses ?-- oh ! : 11.243450590909529
bromley , of course .-- if you mention my name at the bell , you will be attended to ." lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was . : 10.639942970659465
reflection must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections . : 11.379168993298252
she studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different . : 12.16138447910371
when she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion . : 9.671603934510257
his attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again . : 8.945465565867856
in her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin . : 10.584826759870921
they were hopeless of remedy . : 20.58659798641407
her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil . : 11.541246919383555
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother ' s indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ? : 10.018691063070602
catherine , weak - spirited , irritable , and completely under lydia ' s guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and lydia , self - willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing . : 8.200959078317856
they were ignorant , idle , and vain . : 23.22354513742151
while there was an officer in meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn , they would be going there for ever . : 12.89463846745762
anxiety on jane ' s behalf , was another prevailing concern , and mr . : 12.840406232254349
darcy ' s explanation , by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what jane had lost . : 12.749026005622822
his affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend . : 12.315335838317814
how grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family ! : 11.444561154889461
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first . : 13.824759415931762
when they parted , lady catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to hunsford again next year ; and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both . : 9.359024032260907
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr . : 18.48718615813722
collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary . : 8.702041732509578
collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . : 11.321926982306111
we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode . : 17.854919134758873
our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly ." elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness . : 9.321117493059475
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make _her_ feel the obliged . : 12.752660526591196
collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied , " it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably . : 12.167607299313318
we have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome . : 8.898956951654528
you see on what a footing we are . : 23.928937426190462
you see how continually we are engaged there . : 19.181730030359706
in truth i must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings ." words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences . : 10.560025123916288
" you may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire , my dear cousin . : 13.163405555093133
i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so . : 21.93191634648151
collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate -- but on this point it will be as well to be silent . : 11.206695342648308
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us . : 13.08097852705616
we seem to have been designed for each other ." elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts . : 10.299620768059192
she was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung . : 14.292071673906785
poor charlotte !-- it was melancholy to leave her to such society !-- but she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion . : 11.458904641056822
her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms . : 13.470902592531257
at length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready . : 13.030258934939074
after an affectionate parting between the friends , elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr . : 14.559659093277682
collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to mr . : 13.739977561612653
gardiner , though unknown . : 34.37052433881488
" but ," he added , " you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here ." elizabeth made no objection ;-- the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off . : 12.362226099619557
" good gracious !" cried maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but a day or two since we first came !-- and yet how many things have happened !" " a great many indeed ," said her companion with a sigh . : 9.923592850487426
" we have dined nine times at rosings , besides drinking tea there twice !-- how much i shall have to tell !" elizabeth privately added , " and how much i shall have to conceal ." their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving hunsford , they reached mr . : 8.28014083129084
jane looked well , and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them . : 10.789198849204185
but jane was to go home with her , and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation . : 19.619225144847935
darcy ' s proposals . : 33.897143207811474
to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther . : 11.066383318486059
it was the second week in may , in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch - street , for the town of ---- in hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the appointed inn where mr . : 9.207391348036952
bennet ' s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman ' s punctuality , both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining - room up stairs . : 12.531428136994009
after welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , " is not this nice ? : 7.56809158682015
is not this an agreeable surprise ?" " and we mean to treat you all ," added lydia ; " but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there ." then shewing her purchases : " look here , i have bought this bonnet . : 9.21166607342634
i do not think it is very pretty ; but i thought i might as well buy it as not . : 15.311120041945433
i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home , and see if i can make it up any better ." and when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , " oh ! : 11.865371210264541
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and when i have bought some prettier - coloured satin to trim it with fresh , i think it will be very tolerable . : 9.657475158864605
besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the ---- shire have left meryton , and they are going in a fortnight ." " are they indeed ?" cried elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction . : 10.205514594151522
" they are going to be encamped near brighton ; and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! : 14.26042623580198
it would be such a delicious scheme , and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all . : 12.808290550757171
only think what a miserable summer else we shall have !" " yes ," thought elizabeth , " _that_ would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once . : 11.294983962766555
brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of meryton ." " now i have got some news for you ," said lydia , as they sat down to table . : 9.943628586441363
it is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like ." jane and elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay . : 11.285141650532172
lydia laughed , and said , " aye , that is just like your formality and discretion . : 15.996222944164888
you thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! : 22.054422547377715
i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say . : 10.607555113453174
i am glad he is gone . : 29.40582690835772
i never saw such a long chin in my life . : 18.170183047830587
there is no danger of wickham ' s marrying mary king . : 13.717088221103849
she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool ; gone to stay . : 17.271771843445276
wickham is safe ." " and mary king is safe !" added elizabeth ; " safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune ." " she is a great fool for going away , if she liked him ." " but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side ," said jane . : 9.781060889865735
" i am sure there is not on _his_ . : 19.492845569169276
who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing ?" elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself , the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal ! : 8.611494288569203
" how nicely we are crammed in !" cried lydia . : 13.728609188793296
" i am glad i bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox ! : 10.994619067189186
well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home . : 11.821526142197897
and in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away . : 16.534752448819695
have you seen any pleasant men ? : 18.626044157150037
have you had any flirting ? : 42.14375576712219
jane will be quite an old maid soon , i declare . : 18.772001786341143
she is almost three and twenty ! : 21.529598796748108
lord , how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty ! : 10.734816846349126
my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands , you can ' t think . : 12.419948263706052
she says lizzy had better have taken mr . : 15.479369221729378
collins ; but _i_ do not think there would have been any fun in it . : 15.356417763975728
lord ! : 50.74466440582709
how i should like to be married before any of you ; and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls . : 16.107605479179547
dear me ! : 59.68743763198893
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster ' s . : 14.194317932137182
forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; ( by the bye , mrs . : 12.983635526527333
forster and me are _such_ friends !) and so she asked the two harringtons to come , but harriet was ill , and so pen was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? : 10.516845079616344
when denny , and wickham , and pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least . : 20.715175357961062
how i laughed ! : 38.53588405039828
and so did mrs . : 35.45940310303531
forster . : 134.35710631232098
i thought i should have died . : 28.566170298376786
and _that_ made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter ." with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes , did lydia , assisted by kitty ' s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn . : 9.265438687413257
elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham ' s name . : 13.593256583539356
their reception at home was most kind . : 24.004833514488272
bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did mr . : 11.323308747585115
as we went along , kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and i should have gone so all the way , if kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the george , i do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . : 11.239617869243267
and then when we came away it was such fun ! : 21.14033170372375
i thought we never should have got into the coach . : 21.28322245200584
i was ready to die of laughter . : 18.28977781247748
and then we were so merry all the way home ! : 21.29394208320264
we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off !" to this , mary very gravely replied , " far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures . : 9.48395758012406
they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds . : 10.129027867524446
but i confess they would have no charms for _me_ . : 19.497884212803182
i should infinitely prefer a book ." but of this answer lydia heard not a word . : 11.441775417767793
she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to mary at all . : 12.942972338068422
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on ; but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme . : 10.919917236782412
it should not be said , that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers . : 19.677690017807116
there was another reason too for her opposition . : 16.266372448201526
she dreaded seeing wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible . : 15.515437633142453
the comfort to _her_ , of the regiment ' s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression . : 18.590911105615195
in a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account . : 17.646868159693458
she had not been many hours at home , before she found that the brighton scheme , of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents . : 11.574112589835307
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last . : 9.910590782358495
darcy and herself . : 42.060545043299676
miss bennet ' s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings . : 8.321917151190881
darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ' s refusal must have given him . : 10.770857689301632
" his being so sure of succeeding , was wrong ," said she ; " and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment ." " indeed ," replied elizabeth , " i am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . : 10.761281495308703
you do not blame me , however , for refusing him ?" " blame you ! : 19.223786068757203
oh , no ." " but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham ." " no -- i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did ." " but you _will_ know it , when i have told you what happened the very next day ." she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham . : 10.655683143246922
what a stroke was this for poor jane ! : 11.97544771005868
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here collected in one individual . : 8.759117573981671
nor was darcy ' s vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery . : 12.270027273440443
" this will not do ," said elizabeth . : 26.695843995512835
take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . : 19.372400792700365
for my part , i am inclined to believe it all mr . : 17.833432098354255
" wickham so very bad ! : 33.63932055684021
it is almost past belief . : 24.050348485298137
such a disappointment ! : 42.79558677487547
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too ! : 23.816725866871124
and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! : 30.766096058989564
it is really too distressing . : 26.374978268316134
i am sure you must feel it so ." " oh ! : 16.68776234477755
no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both . : 13.57716651114847
i know you will do him such ample justice , that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . : 10.717406700758609
such an openness and gentleness in his manner ." " there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men . : 10.811982090618704
one has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it ." " i never thought mr . : 16.801143314656485
it is such a spur to one ' s genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind . : 12.723686455440335
one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty ." " lizzy , when you first read that letter , i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now ." " indeed i could not . : 11.157759412042585
i was uncomfortable enough . : 34.42133296856537
i was very uncomfortable , i may say unhappy . : 22.189541712347168
and with no one to speak to , of what i felt , no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had ! : 14.562132762663113
how i wanted you !" " how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr . : 8.496236382280971
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging . : 13.765030528401827
there is one point , on which i want your advice . : 20.37543769050898
i want to be told whether i ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham ' s character ." miss bennet paused a little and then replied , " surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . : 11.044226560828564
darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public . : 16.218546323874296
on the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? : 13.166187429249332
the general prejudice against mr . : 24.325725725083228
i am not equal to it . : 26.287506758588933
wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is . : 13.63674804953414
sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . : 8.211925746461217
to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . : 12.278149263953212
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re - establish a character . : 13.226350492923345
she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either . : 13.332646615391152
but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure . : 11.026681593074242
she dared not relate the other half of mr . : 16.295294970863296
darcy ' s letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend . : 14.227070018247785
here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery . : 7.243193965414404
" and then ," said she , " if that very improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . : 10.328077972631712
jane was not happy . : 49.73290676567072
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley . : 19.461149901043203
having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity . : 10.553951930797338
" well , lizzy ," said mrs . : 23.219713622130183
bennet one day , " what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of jane ' s ? : 16.99036842453128
i told my sister philips so the other day . : 18.949291074560364
but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london . : 19.025909130207623
there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer ; and i have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know ." " i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more ." " oh , well ! : 13.66785543938405
it is just as he chooses . : 32.32375652079971
nobody wants him to come . : 26.21255731934233
well , my comfort is , i am sure jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done ." but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer . : 12.48294903095495
well , well , i only hope it will last . : 22.305466440309868
and what sort of table do they keep ? : 15.705977672845025
there is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping , i dare say ." " no , nothing at all ." " a great deal of good management , depend upon it . : 9.86350822394162
_they_ will take care not to outrun their income . : 10.889633064376282
_they_ will never be distressed for money . : 12.19045424882719
well , much good may it do them ! : 13.509721003701154
it would have been strange if they had . : 23.35276846173593
but i make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves . : 16.95142866753909
well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better . : 15.8517867022525
the second began . : 66.69160273949308
it was the last of the regiment ' s stay in meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace . : 17.240576346168417
the dejection was almost universal . : 29.70650774569514
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments . : 12.558007697906197
" good heaven ! : 46.75946203625351
what is to become of us ! : 27.42628289404918
" how can you be smiling so , lizzy ?" their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago . : 7.791639464690166
" i am sure ," said she , " i cried for two days together when colonel millar ' s regiment went away . : 8.63847261504609
i thought i should have broke my heart ." " i am sure i shall break _mine_ ," said lydia . : 12.038182468289975
" if one could but go to brighton !" observed mrs . : 11.882979451591245
" oh , yes !-- if one could but go to brighton ! : 12.14299182638676
but papa is so disagreeable ." " a little sea - bathing would set me up for ever ." " and my aunt philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good ," added kitty . : 8.662327925638552
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn - house . : 9.497344940417335
she felt anew the justice of mr . : 13.234285664531486
darcy ' s objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend . : 14.306034632305122
forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to brighton . : 20.707758603681306
this invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married . : 20.736059694263805
the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of mrs . : 15.498235958355986
forster , the delight of mrs . : 17.68102707075389
bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be described . : 18.895576053514034
wholly inattentive to her sister ' s feelings , lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one ' s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish . : 7.293036433596571
" i cannot see why mrs . : 19.100350871213394
forster should not ask _me_ as well as lydia ," said she , " though i am _not_ her particular friend . : 11.374779814043803
i have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for i am two years older ." in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and jane to make her resigned . : 15.306025807978122
as for elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia , that she considered it as the death - warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go . : 12.389076842664839
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia ' s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs . : 13.56419074207487
forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home . : 11.197305011260644
he heard her attentively , and then said , " lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances ." " if you were aware ," said elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of lydia ' s unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , i am sure you would judge differently in the affair ." " already arisen !" repeated mr . : 10.33055338921132
" what , has she frightened away some of your lovers ? : 19.169175549592786
poor little lizzy ! : 27.020978757530976
come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia ' s folly ." " indeed you are mistaken . : 11.023765541659646
it is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which i am now complaining . : 16.129721342118742
our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia ' s character . : 10.429081999161626
excuse me -- for i must speak plainly . : 18.427880252446993
if you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . : 11.461385322003812
her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous . : 15.619837590719623
she will follow wherever lydia leads . : 16.85518192265987
vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled ! : 12.928326110113359
my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ?" mr . : 11.879474629901527
bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , " do not make yourself uneasy , my love . : 13.489437150735311
wherever you and jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of -- or i may say , three very silly sisters . : 8.481847083335497
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton . : 13.301296499161262
let her go then . : 20.419666694924775
colonel forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body . : 11.119758005740527
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here . : 14.144444266097063
the officers will find women better worth their notice . : 12.752284703270004
let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance . : 14.274372101757457
at any rate , she cannot grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life ." with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry . : 10.481796995182972
it was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them . : 13.643193227625572
she was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition . : 11.53129372723263
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility . : 10.501929422724688
in lydia ' s imagination , a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness . : 12.267817542580053
she saw with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers . : 9.891256176785616
she saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown . : 16.200936161854383
she saw all the glories of the camp ; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet ; and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once . : 6.908569928468881
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ? : 11.206837418338456
lydia ' s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband ' s never intending to go there himself . : 12.786049412765287
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia ' s leaving home . : 11.880645391247658
elizabeth was now to see mr . : 28.37676135619509
wickham for the last time . : 41.6279281716546
having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the agitations of former partiality entirely so . : 6.650663810407432
she had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary . : 9.825312960149514
in his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her . : 9.756802302334464
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal . : 9.758953191251893
he looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment ' s recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and after observing that he was a very gentleman - like man , asked her how she had liked him . : 12.237879632767335
her answer was warmly in his favour . : 22.44451849563725
darcy improves on acquaintance ." " indeed !" cried wickham with a look which did not escape her . : 12.713411008109412
" and pray may i ask ?" but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , " is it in address that he improves ? : 13.288508205117552
has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ? : 11.289441355725396
" in essentials , i believe , he is very much what he ever was ." while she spoke , wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning . : 9.864122757517494
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added , " when i said that he improved on acquaintance , i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood ." wickham ' s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents , " you , who so well know my feelings towards mr . : 9.453303857926256
darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right . : 10.57439813538106
his pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by . : 15.15780889710059
i only fear that the sort of cautiousness , to which you , i imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe . : 11.50196068950423
his fear of her , has always operated , i know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh , which i am certain he has very much at heart ." elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head . : 13.194993574083945
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him . : 15.506295977104134
the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_ , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again . : 10.966734366633975
when the party broke up , lydia returned with mrs . : 14.576583236854425
forster to meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning . : 13.32303970740371
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic . : 14.741162348491983
bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard . : 10.491302433141913
had elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort . : 10.768406440404663
her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her . : 8.930012165991323
respect , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown . : 12.803090387344746
but mr . : 54.92192885776586
bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice . : 8.926185702039145
he was fond of the country and of books ; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments . : 13.633712768417483
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement . : 11.882862443398437
elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ' s behaviour as a husband . : 18.16424712147045
she had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible . : 11.017761683953163
but she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill - judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife . : 7.32092404544716
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham ' s departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment . : 13.525954617231204
their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp . : 7.856961949346433
upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself . : 11.740750338499971
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment . : 8.814556537910281
were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . : 20.338515784219055
but here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister ' s absence , i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized . : 12.706219053237183
a scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation ." when lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short . : 9.755316871744768
those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as mrs . : 9.934750854188113
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re - appear at longbourn . : 10.587910021571398
everything wore a happier aspect . : 7.986286281613215
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose . : 13.71844434654709
bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope , that by the following christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war - office , another regiment should be quartered in meryton . : 8.433876192029942
gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent . : 9.695282143211305
gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july , and must be in london again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than derbyshire . : 10.402152103994212
in that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to mrs . : 16.550416031978664
the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of matlock , chatsworth , dovedale , or the peak . : 10.937582521053224
elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough . : 11.778363541491782
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner . : 14.861877212069302
" but surely ," said she , " i may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me ." the period of expectation was now doubled . : 8.504232929091279
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt ' s arrival . : 13.375764850008208
but they did pass away , and mr . : 23.4058063311536
gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at longbourn . : 16.379415734903063
the children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way -- teaching them , playing with them , and loving them . : 9.77270189630114
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn , and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement . : 11.217384441530193
one enjoyment was certain -- that of suitableness as companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences -- cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure -- and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad . : 5.587964910881911
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; oxford , blenheim , warwick , kenelworth , birmingham , & c . : 6.592774612967902
are sufficiently known . : 41.06645007207568
a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern . : 24.424387204384544
gardiner ' s former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of lambton , elizabeth found from her aunt , that pemberley was situated . : 10.338640421244015
it was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it . : 15.806519092776115
in talking over their route the evening before , mrs . : 17.170774610369733
gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again . : 14.366110872947676
" my love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ?" said her aunt . : 20.764231851156453
" a place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected . : 20.567628035954105
wickham passed all his youth there , you know ." elizabeth was distressed . : 18.746240581913998
she felt that she had no business at pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it . : 11.866946225968501
she must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains . : 9.049493473324228
" if it were merely a fine house richly furnished ," said she , " i should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful . : 9.858220107947478
they have some of the finest woods in the country ." elizabeth said no more -- but her mind could not acquiesce . : 17.237031882353833
the possibility of meeting mr . : 28.581533427634675
it would be dreadful ! : 42.1313500902109
she blushed at the very idea ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk . : 18.321681636600818
accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer . : 11.47496846954696
a most welcome negative followed the last question -- and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme . : 10.905642464398083
to pemberley , therefore , they were to go . : 30.789565928916065
end of the second volume . : 28.23237410539746
[ illustration : dove - dale ] pride & prejudice . : 4.625756147889965
elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter . : 11.229492569015754
the park was very large , and contained great variety of ground . : 20.338281628425175
they entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent . : 8.52965727875274
they gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound . : 8.623645995439954
it was a large , handsome , stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills ;-- and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance . : 6.857124268296122
its banks were neither formal , nor falsely adorned . : 10.077826580245558
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste . : 10.006833936419584
they descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned . : 10.300476979930915
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken . : 19.278043598187175
on applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was . : 16.60739769071209
the housekeeper came ; a respectable - looking , elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her . : 11.971747371612503
they followed her into the dining - parlour . : 17.872991656714465
it was a large , well - proportioned room , handsomely fitted up . : 11.968706263085258
elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect . : 13.99866728511303
the hill , crowned with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object . : 10.514611394387556
as they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different positions ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen . : 8.145288161716735
the rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ; with less of splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings . : 10.863399336500724
with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted ! : 16.81351365439298
instead of viewing them as a stranger , i might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt .-- but no ,"-- recollecting herself ,--" that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me : i should not have been allowed to invite them ." this was a lucky recollection -- it saved her from something like regret . : 8.78343927616823
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it . : 13.257355545547695
at length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while mrs . : 14.221620616306849
reynolds replied , that he was , adding , " but we expect him to - morrow , with a large party of friends ." how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! : 9.57710861554466
her aunt now called her to look at a picture . : 22.25105487234385
wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle - piece . : 7.5491836341870755
her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it . : 20.146533228611077
the housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master ' s steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence .--" he is now gone into the army ," she added , " but i am afraid he has turned out very wild ." mrs . : 10.946409105249812
gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but elizabeth could not return it . : 18.1724906463217
" and that ," said mrs . : 31.041640752297454
reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master -- and very like him . : 12.39972672659346
it was drawn at the same time as the other -- about eight years ago ." " i have heard much of your master ' s fine person ," said mrs . : 11.422853668674906
gardiner , looking at the picture ; " it is a handsome face . : 17.394467321045123
but , lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not ." mrs . : 13.74401463703928
reynolds ' s respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master . : 12.811729541982563
" does that young lady know mr . : 17.713991324420597
darcy ?" elizabeth coloured , and said --" a little ." " and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , ma ' am ?" " yes , very handsome ." " i am sure _i_ know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . : 10.012175228715904
this room was my late master ' s favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . : 13.691345940070827
he was very fond of them ." this accounted to elizabeth for mr . : 15.920847005289145
" and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother ?" said mr . : 18.674751069202106
yes -- the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished !-- she plays and sings all day long . : 7.266416186928454
gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks ; mrs . : 6.860995679188927
reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister . : 10.744677041593967
" is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year ?" " not so much as i could wish , sir ; but i dare say he may spend half his time here ; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months ." " except ," thought elizabeth , " when she goes to ramsgate ." " if your master would marry , you might see more of him ." " yes , sir ; but i do not know when _that_ will be . : 11.251757239164307
gardiner smiled . : 59.31599655044757
elizabeth could not help saying , " it is very much to his credit , i am sure , that you should think so ." " i say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him ," replied the other . : 14.137819201574933
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , " i have never had a cross word from him in my life , and i have known him ever since he was four years old ." this was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas . : 10.782840609013045
that he was not a good - tempered man , had been her firmest opinion . : 16.64056010119906
you are lucky in having such a master ." " yes , sir , i know i am . : 17.432020049128372
if i was to go through the world , i could not meet with a better . : 25.759285604668644
darcy !" thought she . : 36.157429399256145
" his father was an excellent man ," said mrs . : 18.446024082149417
" yes , ma ' am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him -- just as affable to the poor ." elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more . : 11.21538243332992
reynolds could interest her on no other point . : 12.470479024177214
gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase . : 9.642374986578936
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name . : 15.79206833183362
some people call him proud ; but i am sure i never saw any thing of it . : 11.477060195399844
" this fine account of him ," whispered her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend ." " perhaps we might be deceived ." " that is not very likely ; our authority was too good ." on reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting - room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to miss darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at pemberley . : 9.4247294859569
" he is certainly a good brother ," said elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows . : 18.08000204134528
reynolds anticipated miss darcy ' s delight , when she should enter the room . : 13.198836386276193
" and this is always the way with him ," she added .--" whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment . : 14.16393616921847
there is nothing he would not do for her ." the picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed - rooms , were all that remained to be shewn . : 14.646221184738211
in the former were many good paintings ; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy ' s , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible . : 10.185912589671371
in the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger . : 14.517467405935264
elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her . : 16.04357259586057
at last it arrested her -- and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr . : 9.867276527858222
darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her . : 18.395168861008383
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery . : 14.26340503464001
there was certainly at this moment , in elizabeth ' s mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance . : 13.992625853564006
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs . : 22.734985969755282
reynolds was of no trifling nature . : 14.796842119565275
what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ? : 13.8404443668457
as a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people ' s happiness were in his guardianship !-- how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow !-- how much of good or evil must be done by him ! : 12.841821779083984
every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression . : 11.671250469817574
as they walked across the lawn towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables . : 10.701823512945438
they were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight . : 10.272865987241637
their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush . : 12.385723551257154
he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility . : 12.956190689836978
she had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome . : 12.067914391987962
had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr . : 11.782489226667543
darcy , the gardener ' s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it . : 13.549969094881327
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life . : 11.9579172750318
nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts . : 12.128764041790385
at length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave . : 11.556692949472012
the others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence . : 13.234112482972964
her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill - judged thing in the world ! : 23.060686684624503
how strange must it appear to him ! : 21.06614470409411
in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man ! : 10.96630179359852
why did she come ? : 28.879551162214145
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? : 20.154093612319972
had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage . : 11.712397657931644
and his behaviour , so strikingly altered ,-- what could it mean ? : 15.181435893455268
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting . : 10.204445046940219
she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it . : 17.16508180076303
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr . : 12.816702570151953
darcy then was . : 54.16854393809723
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him . : 13.537163097575489
perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been _that_ in his voice , which was not like ease . : 13.805695032535468
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure . : 13.985743032637583
at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself . : 11.335800812543734
they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream . : 9.582196548048277
with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round . : 16.58706177194702
it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts . : 11.936959099855276
they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice - wood which bordered it . : 7.438966983937784
gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible . : 12.607182902075103
her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr . : 12.180260335068759
gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little . : 12.761810838101445
whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth ' s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr . : 12.612137684235329
darcy approaching them , and at no great distance . : 25.05405707649728
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met . : 15.553457940505728
elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them . : 12.602337199546641
for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path . : 13.835645679479372
this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them . : 10.01722438438159
her colour changed , and she said no more . : 27.917698151912195
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself . : 10.0642102579249
" what will be his surprise ," thought she , " when he knows who they are ! : 18.966193857514433
he takes them now for people of fashion ." the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions . : 10.33304647992226
that he was _surprised_ by the connexion was evident ; he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with mr . : 10.34376738775687
elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph . : 16.625768142732827
it was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush . : 11.401884045115587
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners . : 13.702183881708152
the conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard mr . : 16.852439951607078
darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport . : 10.820541750094891
gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder . : 11.675881766210225
elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself . : 16.31559881972662
her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , " why is he so altered ? : 15.735576539219092
from what can it proceed ? : 31.387368104314795
it cannot be for _me_ , it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened . : 13.860355699792184
my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this . : 17.147599433613394
it is impossible that he should still love me ." after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water - plant , there chanced to be a little alteration . : 10.087651857029526
it originated in mrs . : 31.298631050484868
gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeth ' s arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband ' s . : 11.720761663225824
darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together . : 17.39681818202092
after a short silence , the lady first spoke . : 16.470933075129725
she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected --" for your housekeeper ," she added , " informed us that you would certainly not be here till to - morrow ; and indeed , before we left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country ." he acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling . : 10.635641448028528
" they will join me early to - morrow ," he continued , " and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you ,-- mr . : 8.530046276186134
bingley and his sisters ." elizabeth answered only by a slight bow . : 16.12269868738352
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr . : 15.732193375473784
bingley ' s name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , _his_ mind was not very differently engaged . : 11.28590795606933
" there is also one other person in the party ," he continued after a pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you ,-- will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ?" the surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it . : 10.668594817032842
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her . : 13.9745465462835
they now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought . : 13.210311777561211
elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased . : 18.44798304470295
his wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind . : 23.695329751564202
they soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , mr . : 16.15341723254026
gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind . : 18.841803571757342
he then asked her to walk into the house -- but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn . : 15.704186414440011
at such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward . : 23.039865081903013
she wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject . : 14.937963879479668
yet time and her aunt moved slowly -- and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête - à - tête was over . : 8.455815123311556
on mr . : 52.364380854233964
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected . : 16.09755464313493
" he is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming ," said her uncle . : 16.605645312799357
" there _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure ," replied her aunt , " but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming . : 16.088360980486073
i can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , _i_ have seen nothing of it ." " i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . : 10.40272548622883
it was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . : 15.995557937023488
" but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities ," replied her uncle . : 19.780693650886366
" your great men often are ; and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds ." elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing . : 11.394351178204785
" from what we have seen of him ," continued mrs . : 20.651002004970902
gardiner , " i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor wickham . : 14.098875904556847
he has not an ill - natured look . : 19.468262441333085
on the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks . : 10.554727923310097
and there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . : 16.235803816822077
but to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most flaming character ! : 15.117443669701819
but he is a liberal master , i suppose , and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue ." elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor wickham ' s so amiable , as they had been considered in hertfordshire . : 11.985915016526452
in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on . : 12.464291581408743
fatigued as she had been by the morning ' s walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance . : 12.20142241069354
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of mr . : 12.961670755831312
darcy ' s civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister . : 23.694095583185156
elizabeth had settled it that mr . : 17.36897810838871
darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . : 15.100856219994112
they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street . : 12.149441660692371
elizabeth immediately recognising the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected . : 11.339898882690541
her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business . : 15.459232928911275
nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece . : 11.539844760728734
while these newly - born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of elizabeth ' s feelings was every moment increasing . : 7.984016605819415
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her . : 10.319663247774136
miss darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place . : 18.58837016520366
with astonishment did elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself . : 14.361829681409045
since her being at lambton , she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy . : 14.090200170100472
she was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle . : 13.678889683928395
elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr . : 10.788814236090701
darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings . : 13.743218966876642
they had not been long together , before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when bingley ' s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . : 12.233673002137074
all elizabeth ' s anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again . : 11.899615631431894
gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself . : 14.290774926909155
the whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention . : 15.855029669530179
of the lady ' s sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough . : 10.808978515673113
elizabeth , on her side , had much to do . : 35.581076300600245
bingley was ready , georgiana was eager , and darcy determined , to be pleased . : 17.509279113599167
in seeing bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh ! : 20.81815955232493
how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner . : 15.642421697660046
but , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy , who had been set up as a rival of jane . : 14.025785842669553
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard . : 10.638734418392794
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister . : 15.295611854571641
on this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared . : 10.256598329951995
he observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ;" and , before she could reply , he added , " it is above eight months . : 13.925585430544896
we have not met since the <NUM> th of november , when we were all dancing together at netherfield ." elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether _all_ her sisters were at longbourn . : 13.261481043104748
there was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning . : 17.19272807200461
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr . : 16.493950580188695
darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day . : 10.510773739560962
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible . : 9.96408349541332
their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , mr . : 10.831999613616793
darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr . : 16.524873637104502
gardiner , and miss bennet , to dinner at pemberley , before they left the country . : 20.30355726508832
miss darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed . : 10.221852317684696
gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how _she_ , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head . : 9.146496533683486
presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on . : 11.09051803370287
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends . : 11.917984675589523
eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley , and then hurried away to dress . : 10.653231983573162
but she had no reason to fear mr . : 18.715940512798554
gardiner ' s curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication . : 12.918852808090088
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr . : 20.42876266590344
they saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry . : 19.6142289429629
darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find . : 13.66831400444778
they could not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant ' s report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have recognised it for mr . : 12.455188524187728
there was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected . : 12.067539019647574
neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight . : 13.093716884535999
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market - town , where the family did not visit . : 11.628023613614221
it was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor . : 15.764400431615998
with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which mr . : 10.542438168818073
darcy afterwards discharged . : 41.63582246800504
as for elizabeth , her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out . : 11.31006348326261
she certainly did not hate him . : 29.731564885098972
the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced . : 11.119626578730278
it was gratitude .-- gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection . : 9.371188822750531
he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister . : 9.15154925232344
such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude -- for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined . : 11.300785146615869
it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy ' s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning . : 11.722743105737544
gardiner left them soon after breakfast . : 22.849070101360432
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley ' s dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady ' s side , the acquaintance would now be renewed . : 10.499285712656123
on reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer . : 8.512325087908488
its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn . : 7.668909534886435
in this room they were received by miss darcy , who was sitting there with mrs . : 14.489585072222425
georgiana ' s reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved . : 10.593570486878436
gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her . : 19.22859540419823
hurst and miss bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments . : 9.753654676324638
it was first broken by mrs . : 17.91961426586978
annesley , a genteel , agreeable - looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and mrs . : 9.582146900325885
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard . : 12.512949725230555
this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much . : 12.089022119618052
her own thoughts were employing her . : 20.927784223836873
she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room . : 14.130542206711425
she wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine . : 14.462134712854628
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing miss bingley ' s voice , elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family . : 9.794692697342201
she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more . : 13.482377899337884
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs . : 7.579986493755882
annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post . : 18.31714400518036
there was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table . : 10.217653521332451
while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr . : 9.765616721110622
darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came . : 15.789524110026656
he had been some time with mr . : 22.69642188883885
gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning . : 12.154108239205417
no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ;-- a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . : 9.749743702709086
in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley ' s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr . : 9.201247018722034
darcy were by no means over . : 22.8923150122035
miss darcy , on her brother ' s entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side . : 13.366872585739696
while she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes . : 8.75864376215366
had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy ' s opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps . : 10.170755618278111
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy ' s meditated elopement . : 14.510642347603811
to no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to elizabeth ; and from all bingley ' s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own . : 11.070276791143849
he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend . : 12.319800043536455
elizabeth ' s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more . : 9.202535110642856
her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully . : 11.923965422415563
but georgiana would not join her . : 26.81980042288116
her brother ' s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable . : 10.11831142151493
when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister . : 14.424243490567951
" how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , mr . : 13.585264335617877
darcy ," she cried ; " i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter . : 15.390527890851343
she is grown so brown and coarse ! : 12.442684649289152
louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again ." however little mr . : 10.825014940589668
darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned ,-- no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer . : 8.913574408727593
" for my own part ," she rejoined , " i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her . : 15.692857786194647
her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . : 12.46481812448975
her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines . : 12.594077559816224
her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them . : 12.228364769860788
they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self - sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable ." persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected . : 10.293271652170754
he was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , " i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , ' _she_ a beauty !-- i should as soon call her mother a wit .' but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time ." " yes ," replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , " but _that_ was only when i first knew her , for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance ." he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself . : 9.744439832862964
gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both . : 12.170230640859506
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention . : 12.054686837249623
they talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of every thing but himself ; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs . : 17.47688268873736
gardiner thought of him , and mrs . : 25.535295081673663
gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece ' s beginning the subject . : 16.614948395926792
chapter iv . : 40.26276396708214
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane , on their first arrival at lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere . : 11.663383934761779
elizabeth was not surprised at it , as jane had written the direction remarkably ill . : 14.632965580348486
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves . : 10.790917527951654
the one missent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago . : 13.17853742268857
the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence . : 9.732187694207028
it was to this effect : " since writing the above , dearest lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but i am afraid of alarming you -- be assured that we are all well . : 8.012534376752262
what i have to say relates to poor lydia . : 17.866516254883642
an express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from colonel forster , to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with wickham !-- imagine our surprise . : 10.356075939343654
to kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . : 22.084866102344375
i am very , very sorry . : 26.029618001687776
so imprudent a match on both sides !-- but i am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . : 13.40549391294373
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart . : 7.238517526174214
his choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . : 16.69122947938073
our poor mother is sadly grieved . : 13.057411276511402
how thankful am i , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves . : 12.910806967934155
they were off saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . : 9.32092771028067
the express was sent off directly . : 20.07679480188385
my dear lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . : 14.663218022650897
i must conclude , for i cannot be long from my poor mother . : 18.79736650111503
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but i hardly know what i have written ." without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , elizabeth on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first . : 10.07413672868043
" by this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; i wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent . : 12.306513492124337
dearest lizzy , i hardly know what i would write , but i have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed . : 15.342380664847386
imprudent as a marriage between mr . : 16.629816581220908
wickham and our poor lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland . : 12.85821527082911
though lydia ' s short letter to mrs . : 17.841699082754587
never intended to go there , or to marry lydia at all , which was repeated to colonel f . : 16.629057911616627
who instantly taking the alarm , set off from b . : 11.271983534192017
intending to trace their route . : 11.105891822006226
all that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the london road . : 13.440395550330928
i know not what to think . : 27.834329214802064
after making every possible enquiry on that side london , colonel f . : 11.902543136946791
with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . : 11.672414210161948
but no one can throw any blame on them . : 12.783509848008288
our distress , my dear lizzy , is very great . : 22.46722026956973
my father and mother believe the worst , but i cannot think so ill of him . : 11.665014781976847
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of lydia ' s connections , which is not likely , can i suppose her so lost to every thing ?-- impossible . : 9.494179232568353
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when i expressed my hopes , and said he feared w . : 10.9492578896337
was not a man to be trusted . : 38.66314616687701
my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room . : 10.544072017356712
could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , i never in my life saw him so affected . : 16.402960372855784
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder . : 8.85809577184065
i am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient . : 18.57540165058934
adieu . : 67.93655511058085
i take up my pen again to do , what i have just told you i would not , but circumstances are such , that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible . : 12.42815762425825
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that i am not afraid of requesting it , though i have still something more to ask of the former . : 16.748216582325476
my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly , to try to discover her . : 13.703018549143563
what he means to do , i am sure i know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to - morrow evening . : 11.409437831371855
in such an exigence my uncle ' s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what i must feel , and i rely upon his goodness ." " oh ! : 11.912786930629716
where , where is my uncle ?" cried elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and mr . : 13.092791860726873
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia ' s situation , hastily exclaimed , " i beg your pardon , but i must leave you . : 9.443817667945623
i must find mr . : 35.18160064482238
gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ; i have not an instant to lose ." " good god ! : 13.066667544602641
you are not well enough ;-- you cannot go yourself ." elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them . : 9.893304489865585
calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly . : 8.482970460476938
on his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , " let me call your maid . : 10.069672991046714
" there is nothing the matter with me . : 20.820347494441133
i am quite well . : 39.07176497146042
i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn ." she burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word . : 10.678989382408432
darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence . : 12.936043320567643
at length , she spoke again . : 30.827512201472782
" i have just had a letter from jane , with such dreadful news . : 17.239290649580575
it cannot be concealed from any one . : 23.649931635845554
they are gone off together from brighton . : 16.082008847833393
_you_ know him too well to doubt the rest . : 15.617897692923302
she has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to -- she is lost for ever ." darcy was fixed in astonishment . : 12.616142871482646
" when i consider ," she added , in a yet more agitated voice , " that _i_ might have prevented it !-- _i_ who knew what he was . : 11.840851913009997
had i but explained some part of it only -- some part of what i learnt , to my own family ! : 15.588683925786466
had his character been known , this could not have happened . : 20.054407159847436
but it is all , all too late now ." " i am grieved , indeed ," cried darcy ; " grieved -- shocked . : 12.8453868394732
but is it certain , absolutely certain ?" " oh yes !-- they left brighton together on sunday night , and were traced almost to london , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to scotland ." " and what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ?" " my father is gone to london , and jane has written to beg my uncle ' s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , i hope , in half an hour . : 10.46357934335058
but nothing can be done ; i know very well that nothing can be done . : 19.06173045709917
how is such a man to be worked on ? : 24.111408760881552
how are they even to be discovered ? : 29.722161526233876
" when _my_ eyes were opened to his real character .-- oh ! : 13.334512904311566
had i known what i ought , what i dared , to do ! : 25.686312329946546
wretched , wretched , mistake !" darcy made no answer . : 6.732584305238851
he seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ; his brow contracted , his air gloomy . : 10.945102491063913
her power was sinking ; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace . : 10.46794858348502
she could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self - conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress . : 9.123404963429866
it was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain . : 12.570697724012357
but self , though it would intrude , could not engross her . : 18.757822710303156
lydia -- the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , " i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern . : 9.919314178479876
would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress .-- but i will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . : 8.540165809899671
this unfortunate affair will , i fear , prevent my sister ' s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to - day ." " oh , yes . : 11.821882659335197
be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy . : 16.879348717825334
say that urgent business calls us home immediately . : 8.59949004840636
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible .-- i know it cannot be long ." he readily assured her of his secrecy -- again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away . : 9.344863498300159
as he quitted the room , elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire ; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination . : 7.744539708476099
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , elizabeth ' s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty . : 9.850988360300379
but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill - success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment . : 8.46352495815371
be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what lydia ' s infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business . : 10.792488981482483
never , since reading jane ' s second letter , had she entertained a hope of wickham ' s meaning to marry her . : 13.32912768881882
no one but jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation . : 18.888726601546058
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement . : 22.99608068780809
while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise -- all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible . : 10.153782626529642
for such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey . : 8.460270223525557
she had never perceived , while the regiment was in hertfordshire , that lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body . : 12.816225790085554
sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion . : 11.813714887790319
her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object . : 16.96634241327167
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl .-- oh ! : 10.772162717616231
how acutely did she now feel it . : 18.931137667882496
gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant ' s account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ;-- but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy .-- though lydia had never been a favourite with them , mr . : 9.079614645542764
gardiner could not but be deeply affected . : 15.840550827157694
gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power .-- elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled . : 8.203030358482245
" john told us mr . : 22.743666725037386
darcy was here when you sent for us ;-- was it so ?" " yes ; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . : 11.051647646785915
_that_ is all settled ." " that is all settled ;" repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare . : 13.034478433771325
" and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth ! : 13.875082050144284
oh , that i knew how it was !" but wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour . : 9.893894175452775
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure . : 10.982067871233061
an hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and mr . : 15.661342262611807
gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to longbourn . : 12.722428257727925
" i have been thinking it over again , elizabeth ," said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; " and really , upon serious consideration , i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter . : 12.698705987305924
it appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel ' s family , that i am strongly inclined to hope the best . : 10.943582912480116
could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? : 20.028979088297767
his temptation is not adequate to the risk ." " do you really think so ?" cried elizabeth , brightening up for a moment . : 13.813248748234187
" upon my word ," said mrs . : 16.82293220797311
gardiner , " i begin to be of your uncle ' s opinion . : 21.5647054887097
i cannot think so very ill of wickham . : 25.43735803141973
can you , yourself , lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ?" " not perhaps of neglecting his own interest . : 14.296603309288956
but of every other neglect i can believe him capable . : 20.71857136694875
if , indeed , it should be so ! : 35.15621782074868
but i dare not hope it . : 28.654687136480426
why should they not go on to scotland , if that had been the case ?" " in the first place ," replied mr . : 15.8957947570774
gardiner , " there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland ." " oh ! : 11.130760582650433
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption ! : 12.592427888947093
they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose . : 19.20525755215748
it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in london , than in scotland ." " but why all this secrecy ? : 9.864547685453418
why any fear of detection ? : 17.811434985558936
no , no , this is not likely . : 29.35307190922873
his most particular friend , you see by jane ' s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her . : 16.57301133309038
wickham will never marry a woman without some money . : 16.02327026568539
he cannot afford it . : 31.94217216721277
and what claims has lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ? : 10.004615261452832
but as to your other objection , i am afraid it will hardly hold good . : 16.988576246877987
lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father ' s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that _he_ would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter ." " but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ?" " it does seem , and it is most shocking indeed ," replied elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , " that a sister ' s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . : 11.911077186100853
but , really , i know not what to say . : 24.306794499875686
perhaps i am not doing her justice . : 19.235131648041403
but she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . : 12.785865869676437
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . : 12.182680768216708
susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . : 11.325029042531554
and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman ." " but you see that jane ," said her aunt , " does not think so ill of wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt ." " of whom does jane ever think ill ? : 12.606228553963653
and who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? : 13.569452367255753
but jane knows , as well as i do , what wickham really is . : 16.892371635575213
we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word . : 20.122105193970164
that he has neither integrity nor honour . : 17.567125716583277
that he is as false and deceitful , as he is insinuating ." " and do you really know all this ?" cried mrs . : 12.265987272762791
" i do , indeed ," replied elizabeth , colouring . : 21.145499940774382
" i told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to mr . : 21.231754932176667
darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . : 12.301414006715856
and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty -- which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless . : 11.316364344930452
from what he said of miss darcy , i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl . : 13.063590041304176
yet he knew to the contrary himself . : 26.404899979799488
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her ." " but does lydia know nothing of this ? : 13.374643439221064
can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand ?" " oh , yes !-- that , that is the worst of all . : 14.143459568242996
till i was in kent , and saw so much both of mr . : 19.75942670934156
darcy and his relation , colonel fitzwilliam , i was ignorant of the truth myself . : 20.335975236636926
and when i returned home , the ---- shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight ' s time . : 16.03949335273395
as that was the case , neither jane , to whom i related the whole , nor i , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? : 11.733348676329873
and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs . : 16.90039402788355
forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . : 12.687454740846078
that _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . : 16.800133506952367
that such a consequence as _this_ should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts ." " when they all removed to brighton , therefore , you had no reason , i suppose , to believe them fond of each other ." " not the slightest . : 11.413343811056128
i can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away . : 12.491835367151962
when first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . : 13.570015749702128
from elizabeth ' s thoughts it was never absent . : 25.583920907616378
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness . : 8.47702914265162
they travelled as expeditiously as possible ; and sleeping one night on the road , reached longbourn by dinner - time the next day . : 8.769771820719834
the little gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome . : 9.99442177350032
elizabeth jumped out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where jane , who came running down stairs from her mother ' s apartment , immediately met her . : 9.479920245479363
elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives . : 10.80984425336792
" not yet ," replied jane . : 35.34606984980408
" but now that my dear uncle is come , i hope every thing will be well ." " is my father in town ?" " yes , he went on tuesday as i wrote you word ." " and have you heard from him often ?" " we have heard only once . : 14.347629897601873
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which i particularly begged him to do . : 13.763558725254757
he merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention ." " and my mother -- how is she ? : 14.646493455578641
she is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all . : 21.144987819256716
mary and kitty , thank heaven ! : 13.844813068328598
are quite well ." " but you -- how are you ?" cried elizabeth . : 16.403302437995336
" you look pale . : 38.03543641225088
how much you must have gone through !" her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while mr . : 15.02558970479114
gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party . : 14.262850510860654
jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears . : 12.381731986057915
when they were all in the drawing - room , the questions which elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give . : 14.587767119402095
the sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and perhaps announce the marriage . : 11.374842293889888
bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing . : 7.412347317505719
why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight ? : 12.289419419903226
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after . : 14.224139816510213
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but i was over - ruled , as i always am . : 15.758234264583495
poor dear child ! : 26.90958750171772
and now here ' s mr . : 35.04552048187758
the collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , i do not know what we shall do ." they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and mr . : 11.347548415376895
gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in london the very next day , and would assist mr . : 14.32388023366226
" do not give way to useless alarm ," added he , " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . : 14.023254884249942
it is not quite a week since they left brighton . : 17.597742347315684
in a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost . : 12.805970226866464
as soon as i get to town , i shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to gracechurch street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done ." " oh ! : 13.70940637084597
my dear brother ," replied mrs . : 23.211432723546416
bennet , " that is exactly what i could most wish for . : 17.949528516723078
and as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married . : 14.55841180432633
and , above all things , keep mr . : 16.82564163771254
bennet from fighting . : 37.62462686231319
tell him what a dreadful state i am in ,-- that i am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that i can get no rest by night nor by day . : 10.11309301919036
and tell my dear lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses . : 14.19071449822557
oh , brother , how kind you are ! : 22.733189861082266
i know you will contrive it all ." but mr . : 19.708867317266446
gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters . : 13.649797005157778
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that _one_ only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject . : 10.10578925271655
in the dining - room they were soon joined by mary and kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before . : 10.716464971233616
one came from her books , and the other from her toilette . : 22.09708412829583
the faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of kitty . : 11.508741688939569
as for mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , " this is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of . : 12.886490945545741
but we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other , the balm of sisterly consolation ." then , perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " unhappy as the event must be for lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable -- that one false step involves her in endless ruin -- that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful ,-- and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex ." elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply . : 7.968799985843873
mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them . : 10.664561668566588
in the afternoon , the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which jane was equally eager to satisfy . : 11.408081774899859
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which elizabeth considered as all but certain , and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , " but tell me all and every thing about it , which i have not already heard . : 13.016352114512669
give me farther particulars . : 24.338212150335536
what did colonel forster say ? : 27.67340385420986
had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ? : 16.041003927117032
they must have seen them together for ever ." " colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on lydia ' s side , but nothing to give him any alarm . : 11.567884242558074
i am so grieved for him . : 21.402252932954365
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost . : 22.200570742415543
he _was_ coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey ." " and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry ? : 11.202119215915381
did he know of their intending to go off ? : 23.450292204168836
had colonel forster seen denny himself ?" " yes ; but when questioned by _him_ denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it . : 10.220509307059816
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying -- and from _that_ , i am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before ." " and till colonel forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , i suppose , of their being really married ?" " how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains ! : 10.751194047481274
my father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be . : 12.60634514822344
kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in lydia ' s last letter , she had prepared her for such a step . : 12.560282726534908
she had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks ." " but not before they went to brighton ?" " no , i believe not ." " and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself ? : 14.558219782934367
does he know his real character ?" " i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did . : 12.76081195011902
and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left meryton greatly in debt ; but i hope this may be false ." " oh , jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened !" " perhaps it would have been better ;" replied her sister . : 10.571123697128437
" but to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . : 12.454476257538346
we acted with the best intentions ." " could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia ' s note to his wife ?" " he brought it with him for us to see ." jane then took it from her pocket - book , and gave it to elizabeth . : 12.097551271566276
these were the contents : " my dear harriet , " you will laugh when you know where i am gone , and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to - morrow morning , as soon as i am missed . : 12.648087556382757
i am going to gretna green , and if you cannot guess with who , i shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world i love , and he is an angel . : 12.755631018050932
i should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off . : 21.227509034648364
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when i write to them , and sign my name lydia wickham . : 13.508597838302745
what a good joke it will be ! : 26.154355969854773
i can hardly write for laughing . : 20.40228505693526
pray make my excuses to pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to - night . : 11.078623681920106
good bye . : 70.11881345759213
give my love to colonel forster , i hope you will drink to our good journey . : 13.237808022689975
" your affectionate friend , " lydia bennet ." " oh ! : 21.11293399848079
" what a letter is this , to be written at such a moment . : 26.15402542832142
but at least it shews , that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey . : 19.496729277248434
my poor father ! : 47.62023968199433
how he must have felt it !" " i never saw any one so shocked . : 16.657628675644222
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes . : 16.83908716900305
my mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion !" " oh ! : 13.934384927227436
jane ," cried elizabeth , " was there a servant belonging to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ?" " i do not know .-- i hope there was .-- but to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult . : 14.585370909106183
my mother was in hysterics , and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done ! : 14.67473026482109
you do not look well . : 33.702336322308284
that i had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone ." " mary and kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , i am sure , but i did not think it right for either of them . : 12.47982701453159
kitty is slight and delicate , and mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on . : 10.848994298633418
my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till thursday with me . : 15.322202041052273
she was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us ." " she had better have stayed at home ," cried elizabeth ; " perhaps she _meant_ well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one ' s neighbours . : 12.26342044884104
assistance is impossible ; condolence , insufferable . : 10.134161446074476
let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied ." she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter . : 11.13709138694516
" he meant , i believe ," replied jane , " to go to epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them . : 12.813314293072246
his principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham . : 13.924701626643477
it had come with a fare from london ; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady ' s removing from one carriage into another , might be remarked , he meant to make enquiries at clapham . : 10.703059558450148
if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach . : 9.258786707875316
i do not know of any other designs that he had formed : but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this ." chapter vi . : 12.86491564934535
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr . : 20.662236675507422
bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him . : 11.284939540858652
they were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain . : 12.736876572894268
gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off . : 15.031662668330615
when he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on mr . : 12.933553121854526
bennet to return to longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband ' s not being killed in a duel . : 15.211056761379805
she shared in their attendance on mrs . : 18.793094653768176
bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom . : 21.70132759629146
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man , who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light . : 11.529492962943634
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman ' s family . : 11.192453604977464
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness . : 14.861176417907112
elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister ' s ruin still more certain ; and even jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them . : 10.199663018807174
gardiner left longbourn on sunday ; on tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street . : 12.831731570252956
that mr . : 46.01110800021741
bennet had been to epsom and clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town , as mr . : 11.232012845031122
bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to london , before they procured lodgings . : 15.709507661317957
gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it . : 11.638674005642146
he added , that mr . : 32.74204555981193
bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present , to leave london , and promised to write again very soon . : 14.548950062708204
there was also a postscript to this effect . : 13.928347656556362
if there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence . : 15.412959553785846
at present we have nothing to guide us . : 20.528914792759625
but , on second thoughts , perhaps lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person ." elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved . : 9.936383691612823
it was possible , however , that some of his companions in the ---- shire , might be able to give more information ; and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to . : 14.077072698396423
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected . : 15.063081654751619
the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning ' s impatience . : 19.064029293345754
through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance . : 10.128626210974017
but before they heard again from mr . : 16.619684338476727
collins ; which , as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . : 11.947107010775174
it was as follows : " my dear sir , " i feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire . : 10.744303449369156
be assured , my dear sir , that mrs . : 24.163526255992764
no arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent ' s mind . : 9.663460934658776
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . : 17.113161716502113
and it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and mrs . : 12.331955371143987
bennet , i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age . : 12.173244658899888
collins , but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter , to whom i have related the affair . : 17.652807876106134
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others , for who , as lady catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family . : 11.542208681309758
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november , for had it been otherwise , i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . : 8.310101449873656
let me advise you then , my dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence . : 9.452820089441122
" i am , dear sir , & c . : 16.319126583336697
& c ." mr . : 12.255147338459516
gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from colonel forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send . : 16.203542083252447
it was not known that wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living . : 12.574001005518964
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him . : 14.691817940710465
and in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia ' s relations , for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him , to a very considerable amount . : 11.76219864958716
he owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable . : 17.800272450306682
gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family ; jane heard them with horror . : 11.764082687988841
" this is wholly unexpected . : 27.345749133820814
i had not an idea of it ." mr . : 25.062728889591526
gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was saturday . : 17.697757399087834
rendered spiritless by the ill - success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother - in - law ' s intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit . : 10.94058693633698
when mrs . : 53.67653276298213
bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before . : 13.780689498009911
" what , is he coming home , and without poor lydia !" she cried . : 16.944858752389557
" sure he will not leave london before he has found them . : 18.843802481886836
who is to fight wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ?" as mrs . : 14.02225502972083
bennet came from it . : 39.6854281050023
the coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to longbourn . : 13.237132152060502
gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world . : 14.755459276295314
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half - expectation which mrs . : 11.814997906657798
gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing . : 14.368415407598961
elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from pemberley . : 14.004583551164968
the present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from _that_ , though elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of darcy , she could have borne the dread of lydia ' s infamy somewhat better . : 11.404599789007444
who should suffer but myself ? : 21.9669553126595
it has been my own doing , and i ought to feel it ." " you must not be too severe upon yourself ," replied elizabeth . : 15.096378552532906
" you may well warn me against such an evil . : 17.037474747375153
no , lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame . : 15.62968133684294
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . : 17.546642009874795
it will pass away soon enough ." " do you suppose them to be in london ?" " yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ?" " and lydia used to want to go to london ," added kitty . : 12.09329998582263
" she is happy , then ," said her father , drily ; " and her residence there will probably be of some duration ." then , after a short silence , he continued , " lizzy , i bear you no ill - will for being justified in your advice to me last may , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind ." they were interrupted by miss bennet , who came to fetch her mother ' s tea . : 10.002401847987038
" this is a parade ," cried he , " which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune ! : 11.04497392447896
another day i will do the same ; i will sit in my library , in my night cap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as i can ,-- or , perhaps , i may defer it , till kitty runs away ." " i am not going to run away , papa ," said kitty , fretfully ; " if _i_ should ever go to brighton , i would behave better than lydia ." " _you_ go to brighton !-- i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds ! : 9.645190352193719
no officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village . : 12.171195520700326
balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters . : 11.574065478494239
and you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner ." kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry . : 11.33443451406279
if you are a good girl for the next ten years , i will take you to a review at the end of them ." chapter vii . : 15.375359321845826
two days after mr . : 22.589020329965727
bennet ' s return , as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to miss bennet , " i beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so i took the liberty of coming to ask ." " what do you mean , hill ? : 10.839339228956518
we have heard nothing from town ." " dear madam ," cried mrs . : 14.190867858352327
hill , in great astonishment , " don ' t you know there is an express come for master from mr . : 10.49663732502212
gardiner ? : 178.5739886791417
he has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter ." away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech . : 10.879727109042207
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from thence to the library ;-- their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said , " if you are looking for my master , ma ' am , he is walking towards the little copse ." upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock . : 9.146473907713014
jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , " oh , papa , what news ? : 10.549443915222852
what news ? : 77.8875870253437
good or bad ?" " what is there of good to be expected ?" said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; " but perhaps you would like to read it ." elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand . : 12.331217153463143
jane now came up . : 30.17057314705158
the particulars , i reserve till we meet . : 26.619482217266345
it is enough to know they are discovered , i have seen them both ----" " then it is , as i always hoped ," cried jane ; " they are married !" elizabeth read on ; " i have seen them both . : 13.639015491876009
all that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum . : 9.789470863054182
these are conditions , which , considering every thing , i had no hesitation in complying with , as far as i thought myself privileged , for you . : 13.114320006618392
you will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that mr . : 17.049349230979313
wickham ' s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be . : 16.463476712358204
the world has been deceived in that respect ; and i am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune . : 13.539418517521428
if , as i conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement . : 8.806167093163978
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore , stay quietly at longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care . : 12.503074170312335
send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly . : 11.513188004921485
we have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which i hope you will approve . : 15.660449009729689
she comes to us to - day . : 31.915842667804057
i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on . : 13.977019416840202
your ' s , & c . : 18.194154582394322
" edw . : 109.53593306026099
gardiner ." " is it possible !" cried elizabeth , when she had finished . : 21.381665877181213
" can it be possible that he will marry her ?" " wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ;" said her sister . : 15.276796812216046
" my dear father , i congratulate you ." " and have you answered the letter ?" said elizabeth . : 16.08617133335398
" no ; but it must be done soon ." most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote . : 13.040738544113786
my dear father ," she cried , " come back , and write immediately . : 17.478802682166602
" and may i ask ?" said elizabeth , " but the terms , i suppose , must be complied with ." " complied with ! : 15.98164586512485
i am only ashamed of his asking so little ." " and they _must_ marry ! : 17.34709884440658
yet he is _such_ a man !" " yes , yes , they must marry . : 19.164728412573886
there is nothing else to be done . : 25.28963144326759
but there are two things that i want very much to know :-- one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ; and the other , how i am ever to pay him ." " money ! : 13.679866991870233
his debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! : 25.77384828727239
it must be my uncle ' s doings ! : 28.2569108177334
generous , good man , i am afraid he has distressed himself . : 13.729308653475318
a small sum could not do all this ." " no ," said her father , " wickham ' s a fool , if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds . : 13.837337792704457
i should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship ." " ten thousand pounds ! : 15.500468971620995
how is half such a sum to be repaid ?" mr . : 14.084945657300523
bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house . : 10.876126387949702
their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast - room . : 14.06031987236396
" and they are really to be married !" cried elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves . : 18.54644660072126
" how strange this is ! : 36.79363522009033
and for _this_ we are to be thankful . : 28.916252013612898
that they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! : 12.04423111640344
oh , lydia !" " i comfort myself with thinking ," replied jane , " that he certainly would not marry lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . : 13.919900726615685
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced . : 11.1859125114274
he has children of his own , and may have more . : 26.02426595416786
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds ?" " if we are ever able to learn what wickham ' s debts have been ," said elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what mr . : 10.476750589234854
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited . : 17.153838337742705
their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge . : 11.491250134590764
by this time she is actually with them ! : 24.471170713065998
if such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! : 19.011744866210666
what a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt !" " we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side ," said jane : " i hope and trust they will yet be happy . : 10.826720291606772
his consenting to marry her is a proof , i will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking . : 16.291624054836316
their mutual affection will steady them ; and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten ." " their conduct has been such ," replied elizabeth , " as neither you , nor i , nor any body , can ever forget . : 9.47658425518558
it is useless to talk of it ." it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened . : 13.435638506148512
they went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her . : 17.02304096368188
he was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " just as you please ." " may we take my uncle ' s letter to read to her ?" " take whatever you like , and get away ." elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together . : 12.80866630546643
mary and kitty were both with mrs . : 11.949699286409485
bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all . : 16.667170872047798
after a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud . : 14.180230589862294
bennet could hardly contain herself . : 23.640326839444725
as soon as jane had read mr . : 18.012479553780278
gardiner ' s hope of lydia ' s being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance . : 11.414946023125648
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation . : 10.224264626037002
to know that her daughter would be married was enough . : 28.818088673072676
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct . : 13.716842715040569
how i long to see her ! : 23.160996264713557
and to see dear wickham too ! : 35.76164667451343
but the clothes , the wedding clothes ! : 29.893454767454493
lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . : 16.798435510499864
stay , stay , i will go myself . : 20.98682748236657
ring the bell , kitty , for hill . : 14.926689673076638
i will put on my things in a moment . : 20.413639913659672
my dear , dear lydia !-- how merry we shall be together when we meet !" her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr . : 8.233870537428878
gardiner ' s behaviour laid them all under . : 15.228413498008672
" for we must attribute this happy conclusion ," she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness . : 15.575908621661446
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr . : 14.675606013786364
if he had not had a family of his own , i and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents . : 16.61580841134345
well ! : 195.53882200464318
i am so happy . : 32.95639829595065
wickham ! : 180.9746784216464
how well it sounds . : 22.595054786188978
my dear jane , i am in such a flutter , that i am sure i can ' t write ; so i will dictate , and you write for me . : 13.151514482911622
one day ' s delay she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual . : 14.919377162370123
" i will go to meryton ," said she , " as soon as i am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister philips . : 15.580238529818367
and as i come back , i can call on lady lucas and mrs . : 19.93285857344036
kitty , run down and order the carriage . : 12.10127465755845
an airing would do me a great deal of good , i am sure . : 13.812930442193936
girls , can i do any thing for you in meryton ? : 27.22837939984674
here comes hill . : 29.34405285632731
miss lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch , to make merry at her wedding ." mrs . : 11.36004578868908
hill began instantly to express her joy . : 12.134237418921686
poor lydia ' s situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful . : 14.540421049742466
she felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ; in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained . : 10.48097869901065
he now wished it more than ever . : 28.04076417259336
had he done his duty in that respect , lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her . : 11.535633367128208
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband , might then have rested in its proper place . : 9.249707226635731
he was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother - in - law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could . : 12.610664881281272
when first mr . : 38.17180322561591
bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son . : 13.967115745428144
five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and mrs . : 13.746187778331976
this event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving . : 14.866946965557254
bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband ' s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income . : 9.386825318859305
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs . : 8.688265445080843
bennet and the children . : 70.04027978525701
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents . : 14.346168871891855
this was one point , with regard to lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and mr . : 18.539795361281577
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him . : 9.656028791171678
he had never before supposed that , could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement . : 14.753767247195444
he would scarcely be ten pounds a - year the loser , by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother ' s hands , lydia ' s expences had been very little within that sum . : 9.697560181355122
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence . : 9.120850715535626
his letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution . : 11.38511337407177
the good news quickly spread through the house ; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood . : 15.011438018271699
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy . : 18.703546765678063
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had miss lydia bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house . : 11.944337629143613
bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high . : 15.854974379119156
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph . : 14.388337229674548
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance . : 9.400308181180575
" haye - park might do ," said she , " if the gouldings would quit it , or the great house at stoke , if the drawing - room were larger ; but ashworth is too far off ! : 8.681267046232264
i could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for purvis lodge , the attics are dreadful ." her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained . : 10.865361215499576
bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding . : 13.493258809907694
into _one_ house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance . : 16.37440155911858
i will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at longbourn ." a long dispute followed this declaration ; but mr . : 9.705900217839341
bennet was firm : it soon led to another ; and mrs . : 12.400424656741
bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter . : 11.856234010321995
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion . : 12.606294917185252
bennet could hardly comprehend it . : 22.397663343911002
that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible . : 8.99758097835585
she was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham , a fortnight before they took place . : 10.675913866838247
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make mr . : 17.1699829741841
darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot . : 11.256547536667673
she had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means . : 14.338587054019053
not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , individually to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them . : 11.018620747453896
had lydia ' s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that mr . : 14.144848514247677
darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned . : 11.17685095210623
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink . : 20.37574185288048
the wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this . : 12.431150606818901
she was humbled , she was grieved ; she repented , though she hardly knew of what . : 15.335600597617045
she became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it . : 17.579777777033858
she wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence . : 18.197122019151063
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they should meet . : 16.773229003893288
what a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received ! : 11.30037538311007
he was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex . : 21.04986702409494
but while he was mortal , there must be a triumph . : 25.089177714418216
his understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes . : 18.1930809735874
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance . : 13.026400914762032
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was . : 6.3469101312492535
an union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family . : 18.2386634304592
* * * * * mr . : 8.716667983836368
gardiner soon wrote again to his brother . : 21.782291833989138
bennet ' s acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again . : 12.52151542090943
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that mr . : 20.80959411779479
wickham had resolved on quitting the militia . : 14.52289515464384
" it was greatly my wish that he should do so ," he added , " as soon as his marriage was fixed on . : 13.592757283460102
wickham ' s intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . : 10.250095567679612
he has the promise of an ensigncy in general ----' s regiment , now quartered in the north . : 11.479510810714357
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . : 21.4234664285299
he promises fairly , and i hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . : 10.793951462022054
i have written to colonel forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr . : 11.164391211399247
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton , of whom i shall subjoin a list , according to his information . : 9.402345481279108
he has given in all his debts ; i hope at least he has not deceived us . : 15.3057207560595
haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week . : 14.128415652426295
they will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to longbourn ; and i understand from mrs . : 11.905127785257951
gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the south . : 13.090061105373543
she is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother .-- your ' s , & c . : 16.071274925629645
" e . : 111.37063362048212
gardiner ." mr . : 28.686438743531696
bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham ' s removal from the ---- shire , as clearly as mr . : 12.9844909699801
lydia ' s being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites . : 11.484210082308692
" she is so fond of mrs . : 24.992961683536166
forster ," said she , " it will be quite shocking to send her away ! : 11.885916107485743
and there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much . : 18.85782427989537
the officers may not be so pleasant in general ----' s regiment ." his daughter ' s request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the north , received at first an absolute negative . : 11.78440929145796
but jane and elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ' s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . : 11.445471968845817
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the north . : 15.130055708338752
bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to longbourn . : 14.141534578981473
their sister ' s wedding day arrived ; and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself . : 16.286413852684635
the carriage was sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return in it , by dinner - time . : 14.555314057391257
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets ; and jane more especially , who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had _she_ been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure . : 11.994874587686134
they came . : 98.20166553792234
the family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them . : 25.673280144342034
smiles decked the face of mrs . : 9.689735213434423
lydia ' s voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room . : 11.723043830878726
their reception from mr . : 24.419358854465298
bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial . : 16.510932963713632
the easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him . : 19.787711991109152
elizabeth was disgusted , and even miss bennet was shocked . : 23.002195536679025
lydia was lydia still ; untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless . : 7.28649132626809
she turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there . : 11.163407495898799
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all . : 12.080299045449317
_she_ blushed , and jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour . : 9.485147722156475
there was no want of discourse . : 22.256915958126417
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and wickham , who happened to sit near elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies . : 12.081912782598973
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world . : 17.32545226924011
nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world . : 12.392718405969335
" only think of its being three months ," she cried , " since i went away ; it seems but a fortnight i declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time . : 13.337671425284915
good gracious ! : 51.21564198210567
when i went away , i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again ! : 14.255334525341388
though i thought it would be very good fun if i was ." her father lifted up his eyes . : 16.156132079067334
jane was distressed . : 39.542867935270024
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , " oh ! : 11.834791357391977
mamma , do the people here abouts know i am married to - day ? : 11.118877320091965
i was afraid they might not ; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle , so i was determined he should know it , and so i let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then i bowed and smiled like any thing ." elizabeth could bear it no longer . : 9.962552898194497
she got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining - parlour . : 15.304542335305017
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother ' s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , " ah ! : 14.250316668834937
jane , i take your place now , and you must go lower , because i am a married woman ." it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first . : 11.197644951242479
she longed to see mrs . : 36.66729241941284
wickham ," by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to mrs . : 11.614653503947883
hill and the two housemaids . : 26.1482285488006
" well , mamma ," said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , " and what do you think of my husband ? : 15.968629083331107
i am sure my sisters must all envy me . : 12.08596737914008
i only hope they may have half my good luck . : 15.89746186239524
they must all go to brighton . : 22.704129829795622
that is the place to get husbands . : 31.19100211104389
what a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go ." " very true ; and if i had my will , we should . : 17.083031980568745
but my dear lydia , i don ' t at all like your going such a way off . : 17.575262787277197
yes ;-- there is nothing in that . : 25.010368343213994
i shall like it of all things . : 33.437454577136606
you and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us . : 19.84150119175099
we shall be at newcastle all the winter , and i dare say there will be some balls , and i will take care to get good partners for them all ." " i should like it beyond any thing !" said her mother . : 10.901705271600303
" and then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over ." " i thank you for my share of the favour ," said elizabeth ; " but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands ." their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them . : 10.196355536687378
wickham ' s affection for lydia , was just what elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to lydia ' s for him . : 14.668101902242295
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion . : 11.202048050079078
lydia was exceedingly fond of him . : 24.16487181240122
he was her dear wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him . : 12.161345604525756
one morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to elizabeth , " lizzy , i never gave _you_ an account of my wedding , i believe . : 14.735096315606858
you were not by , when i told mamma , and the others , all about it . : 20.23271527885884
are not you curious to hear how it was managed ?" " no really ," replied elizabeth ; " i think there cannot be too little said on the subject ." " la ! : 12.832547844238201
but i must tell you how it went off . : 18.031205254058026
we were married , you know , at st . : 24.05868799236179
clement ' s , because wickham ' s lodgings were in that parish . : 15.863697341996977
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o ' clock . : 9.552933205134707
my uncle and aunt and i were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church . : 18.286015853588207
well , monday morning came , and i was in such a fuss ! : 17.552498515172086
i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then i should have gone quite distracted . : 13.527463629020149
and there was my aunt , all the time i was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . : 15.052248880564331
however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham . : 14.996244107533826
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat . : 21.723522404399677
" well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ; i thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them . : 11.927565314902678
if you ' ll believe me , i did not once put my foot out of doors , though i was there a fortnight . : 11.293753816711781
to be sure london was rather thin , but however the little theatre was open . : 12.433649874497775
well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr . : 12.327581895453186
stone . : 53.923827724386356
and then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . : 16.947910926475174
but , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out . : 15.59303762156037
however , i recollected afterwards , that if he _had_ been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for mr . : 13.48050876580593
darcy might have done as well ." " mr . : 21.529395388033613
darcy !" repeated elizabeth , in utter amazement . : 27.03407096219808
" oh , yes !-- he was to come there with wickham , you know . : 17.505431667231946
but gracious me ! : 50.88137870030808
i quite forgot ! : 56.70246760441503
i ought not to have said a word about it . : 21.300612008091957
i promised them so faithfully ! : 25.76672669917313
what will wickham say ? : 27.88725577018368
it was to be such a secret !" " if it was to be secret ," said jane , " say not another word on the subject . : 16.72198903285162
certainly ," said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions ." " thank you ," said lydia , " for if you did , i should certainly tell you all , and then wickham would be angry ." on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away . : 11.783927703667977
darcy had been at her sister ' s wedding . : 27.60285497270426
it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go . : 14.432409497202197
those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable . : 11.472264767525148
she could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended . : 9.546780095338724
" you may readily comprehend ," she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . : 11.092596851807803
pray write instantly , and let me understand it -- unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary ; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance ." " not that i _shall_ though ," she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out ." jane ' s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall ; elizabeth was glad of it ;-- till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante . : 9.88668405078406
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could . : 16.785163431486932
she was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial . : 14.737041799000611
" gracechurch - street , sept . : 21.06194869906721
" my dear niece , " i have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as i foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise what i have to tell you . : 10.402948699214557
i must confess myself surprised by your application ; i did not expect it from _you_ . : 13.618170838623957
if you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . : 13.718235217281725
your uncle is as much surprised as i am -- and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done . : 15.918903486145794
but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit . : 18.50169579116534
darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours . : 19.623547599572984
it was all over before i arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _your ' s_ seems to have been . : 9.003456264755702
he came to tell mr . : 32.573225344252386
wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , wickham repeatedly , lydia once . : 14.58176360622933
from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them . : 14.789490668556414
the motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham ' s worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him . : 12.012009907048363
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world . : 12.797034481929453
he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself . : 14.666437914629832
if he _had another_ motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him . : 11.849161534081542
younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . : 10.582483827855349
this mrs . : 81.8305719665595
younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . : 15.0554867367118
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . : 17.764347361871113
she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . : 11.432079305332874
wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . : 13.068714461782237
at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished - for direction . : 8.236389171999189
they were in ---- street . : 22.774378826718774
he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia . : 18.87532960216926
his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go . : 15.39488898575319
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . : 13.203120404740199
she cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving wickham . : 16.489460632319254
she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . : 16.317957385425757
since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt , had never been _his_ design . : 13.708050209329583
he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill - consequences of lydia ' s flight , on her own folly alone . : 12.129601511435734
he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . : 12.47419569226608
he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . : 18.1609916168838
darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once . : 16.763038415212744
though mr . : 67.60636459720699
bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . : 15.999818514442618
but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country . : 12.61303766429031
under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . : 11.124905341901691
they met several times , for there was much to be discussed . : 24.449991940442512
wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . : 16.172270060030378
every thing being settled between _them_ , mr . : 11.546613962418377
darcy ' s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch - street the evening before i came home . : 11.82378437924035
gardiner could not be seen , and mr . : 24.143913928423768
darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . : 15.158613286565986
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former . : 13.941701264703685
on saturday he came again . : 30.250297799076954
your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they had a great deal of talk together . : 16.593111382871356
they met again on sunday , and then _i_ saw him too . : 17.947015967021102
it was not all settled before monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn . : 12.397335133921928
but our visitor was very obstinate . : 24.79443487844692
i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all . : 19.194260457335332
he has been accused of many faults at different times ; but _this_ is the true one . : 10.76599886865058
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though i am sure ( and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it ,) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . : 11.319182494077113
they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved . : 13.28646190119909
but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due . : 10.257671522163115
but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most . : 14.065264698248589
you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people . : 19.5062888652188
his debts are to be paid , amounting , i believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_ , and his commission purchased . : 11.437404218662932
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above . : 20.372456279644194
it was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that wickham ' s character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . : 15.443500187410427
perhaps there was some truth in _this_ ; though i doubt whether _his_ reserve , or _anybody ' s_ reserve , can be answerable for the event . : 10.220662292022666
but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for _another interest_ in the affair . : 10.545877037683747
when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish . : 13.995616099837894
i believe i have now told you every thing . : 24.49467735404039
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . : 12.777621586413483
lydia came to us ; and wickham had constant admission to the house . : 20.21200947925815
_he_ was exactly what he had been , when i knew him in hertfordshire ; but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with _her_ behaviour while she staid with us , if i had not perceived , by jane ' s letter last wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what i now tell you , can give you no fresh pain . : 11.136618980003089
if she heard me , it was by good luck , for i am sure she did not listen . : 18.51606166260787
i was sometimes quite provoked , but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . : 13.06211904342086
darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding . : 18.12511494688277
he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday . : 14.65596713947153
will you be very angry with me , my dear lizzy , if i take this opportunity of saying ( what i was never bold enough to say before ) how much i like him . : 10.910498439649345
his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire . : 13.69167561071203
i thought him very sly ;-- he hardly ever mentioned your name . : 10.892408322459998
but slyness seems the fashion . : 20.184745787317414
pray forgive me , if i have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from p . : 12.180189006488282
i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park . : 16.454544847747542
but i must write no more . : 29.709119275622093
the children have been wanting me this half hour . : 19.274013802942846
your ' s , very sincerely , " m . : 27.50121234190133
gardiner ." the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share . : 9.490764655522645
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr . : 10.062100789510884
darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! : 10.830559110570878
he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce . : 10.23265960356333
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem . : 15.148869793459719
but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham . : 9.985106702146282
brother - in - law of wickham ! : 14.208708766463154
every kind of pride must revolt from the connection . : 18.797312037694965
but he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief . : 12.065324200312691
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned . : 11.671429982716544
it was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return . : 13.940956061946482
they owed the restoration of lydia , her character , every thing to him . : 20.23030955992648
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him . : 8.599467035266358
for herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him . : 21.619803059602877
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself . : 13.479809880991535
she read over her aunt ' s commendation of him again and again . : 19.783405911896576
it was hardly enough ; but it pleased her . : 19.350754844849632
she was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr . : 9.54515151601539
" you certainly do ," she replied with a smile ; " but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome ." " i should be sorry indeed , if it were . : 13.96516355697887
are the others coming out ?" " i do not know . : 17.863299161245394
bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton . : 23.321357530809102
and so , my dear sister , i find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen pemberley ." she replied in the affirmative . : 16.462722317913368
" i almost envy you the pleasure , and yet i believe it would be too much for me , or else i could take it in my way to newcastle . : 16.29883865371688
and you saw the old housekeeper , i suppose ? : 28.9142711993973
poor reynolds , she was always very fond of me . : 18.389278442188488
but of course she did not mention my name to you ." " yes , she did ." " and what did she say ?" " that you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had -- not turned out well . : 12.539485012727834
at such a distance as _that_ , you know , things are strangely misrepresented ." " certainly ," he replied , biting his lips . : 9.803912338144121
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ; but he soon afterwards said , " i was surprised to see darcy in town last month . : 15.046264071851411
we passed each other several times . : 22.74542605494582
i wonder what he can be doing there ." " perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh ," said elizabeth . : 13.298778299368713
did you see him while you were at lambton ? : 23.48610060041138
i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had ." " yes ; he introduced us to his sister ." " and do you like her ?" " very much ." " i have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two . : 13.362666963272657
when i last saw her , she was not very promising . : 21.25255877141081
i am very glad you liked her . : 18.518292270183853
i hope she will turn out well ." " i dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age ." " did you go by the village of kympton ?" " i do not recollect that we did ." " i mention it , because it is the living which i ought to have had . : 12.242514050304452
it would have suited me in every respect ." " how should you have liked making sermons ?" " exceedingly well . : 12.655120327796824
i should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing . : 17.82375361363846
one ought not to repine ;-- but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! : 19.513432536787167
the quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! : 18.602111985376073
but it was not to be . : 37.938700271290855
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in kent ?" " i _have_ heard from authority , which i thought _as good_ , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron ." " you have . : 11.745813051255459
yes , there was something in _that_ ; i told you so from the first , you may remember ." " i _did_ hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon - making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly ." " you did ! : 12.422309348901768
and it was not wholly without foundation . : 24.367354164503322
you may remember what i told you on that point , when first we talked of it ." they were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister ' s sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good - humoured smile , " come , mr . : 13.046342306082684
wickham , we are brother and sister , you know . : 22.236146810872373
do not let us quarrel about the past . : 17.456639799239408
in future , i hope we shall be always of one mind ." she held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house . : 11.593149550294717
wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet . : 12.681234575305922
the day of his and lydia ' s departure soon came , and mrs . : 18.357267912303758
bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth . : 11.253085655491903
my dear lydia ," she cried , " when shall we meet again ?" " oh , lord ! : 12.506539963110306
i don ' t know . : 24.57196979767401
not these two or three years perhaps ." " write to me very often , my dear ." " as often as i can . : 18.277626610292774
but you know married women have never much time for writing . : 13.280170607970389
my sisters may write to _me_ . : 20.617050086435135
they will have nothing else to do ." mr . : 22.23175530261778
wickham ' s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife ' s . : 13.029161133334808
" he is as fine a fellow ," said mr . : 15.19338168810902
bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , " as ever i saw . : 17.976364063624615
he simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all . : 25.20339068662139
i am prodigiously proud of him . : 20.821419973850407
i defy even sir william lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son - in - law ." the loss of her daughter made mrs . : 10.675628672750408
bennet very dull for several days . : 15.83327172542694
" i often think ," said she , " that there is nothing so bad as parting with one ' s friends . : 12.329268319166024
one seems so forlorn without them ." " this is the consequence you see , madam , of marrying a daughter ," said elizabeth . : 10.25674570557925
lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband ' s regiment happens to be so far off . : 14.557518735699901
if that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon ." but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation . : 12.417841658196291
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks . : 12.721838244283067
bennet was quite in the fidgets . : 35.93285351515667
she looked at jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns . : 19.34930234852777
" well , well , and so mr . : 31.40873663681876
philips first brought her the news .) " well , so much the better . : 10.393218435970397
he is nothing to us , you know , and i am sure _i_ never want to see him again . : 16.72918766660297
but , however , he is very welcome to come to netherfield , if he likes it . : 17.351911949245558
but that is nothing to us . : 38.90802860464493
you know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it . : 13.704532345622592
and so , is it quite certain he is coming ?" " you may depend on it ," replied the other , " for mrs . : 16.784745193212956
nicholls was in meryton last night ; i saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true . : 11.674376413878399
he comes down on thursday at the latest , very likely on wednesday . : 13.292324181841519
she was going to the butcher ' s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks , just fit to be killed ." miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour . : 12.11461842755124
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , " i saw you look at me to - day , lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and i know i appeared distressed . : 13.657801507080535
but don ' t imagine it was from any silly cause . : 15.429105689538105
i was only confused for the moment , because i felt that i _should_ be looked at . : 18.52548756266688
i am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . : 14.023593040662352
not that i am afraid of _myself_ , but i dread other people ' s remarks ." elizabeth did not know what to make of it . : 14.019143301199028
had she not seen him in derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend ' s permission , or being bold enough to come without it . : 11.883487997538635
i _will_ leave him to himself ." in spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it . : 16.026806777263463
they were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them . : 12.907725242448034
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again . : 11.305986768257334
bingley comes , my dear ," said mrs . : 14.65959616076929
bennet , " you will wait on him of course ." " no , no . : 20.453974662964452
you forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if i went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . : 16.60896929157456
but it ended in nothing , and i will not be sent on a fool ' s errand again ." his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to netherfield . : 11.576445424773969
"' tis an etiquette i despise ," said he . : 7.452573388263237
" if he wants our society , let him seek it . : 14.572225106973969
he knows where we live . : 29.25529249534994
i will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again ." " well , all i know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him . : 10.643401321837894
we must have mrs . : 33.267000076513895
long and the gouldings soon . : 32.43712707507326
that will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him ." consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ' s incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr . : 10.554389643949477
bingley in consequence of it , before _they_ did . : 21.99781618818083
as the day of his arrival drew near , " i begin to be sorry that he comes at all ," said jane to her sister . : 18.728601166105467
" it would be nothing ; i could see him with perfect indifference , but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . : 13.497965873532136
my mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much i suffer from what she says . : 15.153830893156266
happy shall i be , when his stay at netherfield is over !" " i wish i could say any thing to comfort you ," replied elizabeth ; " but it is wholly out of my power . : 13.142943984326434
you must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much ." mr . : 12.633361428055812
bingley arrived . : 82.49684326525662
bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could . : 10.513446211777481
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before . : 8.48309784703942
jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window -- she looked ,-- she saw mr . : 12.751011548784886
darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister . : 22.98520280450635
" there is a gentleman with him , mamma ," said kitty ; " who can it be ?" " some acquaintance or other , my dear , i suppose ; i am sure i do not know ." " la !" replied kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . : 12.020788033583242
what ' s his name . : 46.58725585806778
that tall , proud man ." " good gracious ! : 16.944820064653662
darcy !-- and so it does i vow . : 21.254949978710965
well , any friend of mr . : 16.17754613178443
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter . : 11.818546292198372
each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of mr . : 17.258340224742632
darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr . : 20.05314541623163
bingley ' s friend , without being heard by either of them . : 16.904384010229702
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs . : 11.270393868985607
gardiner ' s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him . : 13.529098429791881
to jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what jane felt for bingley . : 13.14097656538451
her astonishment at his coming -- at his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire . : 12.586938513645016
but she would not be secure . : 33.169761577588
" let me first see how he behaves ," said she ; " it will then be early enough for expectation ." she sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door . : 9.395075184282723
jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than elizabeth had expected . : 12.548989004992277
on the gentlemen ' s appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance . : 9.450904771650533
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command . : 13.811346200946046
she had ventured only one glance at darcy . : 15.75408087301263
he looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at pemberley . : 15.534518195406479
but , perhaps he could not in her mother ' s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt . : 16.394124593508867
it was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture . : 16.521394065506342
bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed . : 11.170721441630386
bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend . : 11.174162014540562
elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied . : 10.092792014630994
gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing . : 14.902399972940358
he was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in derbyshire . : 17.916404950299434
there he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself . : 30.02076404973543
but now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground . : 10.367692366622776
more thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed . : 13.81337220698117
" could i expect it to be otherwise !" said she . : 19.563836174707024
she enquired after his sister , but could do no more . : 23.446917183952888
" it is a long time , mr . : 21.004611632956745
bingley , since you went away ," said mrs . : 14.427681154050713
he readily agreed to it . : 30.943003137450486
" i began to be afraid you would never come back again . : 22.88943798809984
people _did_ say , you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas ; but , however , i hope it is not true . : 12.865348553590445
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away . : 12.420360409973503
miss lucas is married and settled . : 14.949902882228812
and one of my own daughters . : 49.12151426519272
i suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers . : 23.30292563335902
it was only said , ' lately , george wickham , esq . : 15.283355481077443
to miss lydia bennet ,' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing . : 13.531331173099609
it was my brother gardiner ' s drawing up too , and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . : 15.14224515886521
did you see it ?" bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations . : 17.309101222634425
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes . : 16.765708436358125
how mr . : 57.24122008241211
darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell . : 22.111621791233105
" it is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married ," continued her mother , " but at the same time , mr . : 14.647436894253351
bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me . : 15.767085664906299
they are gone down to newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , i do not know how long . : 15.008346543158781
he has _some_ friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves ." elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at mr . : 14.974189876668431
darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat . : 15.808704558464978
it drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present . : 13.868910954238281
a few weeks , he believed . : 33.349108835143525
" when you have killed all your own birds , mr . : 14.141480724000644
bingley ," said her mother , " i beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on mr . : 13.594881602358932
bennet ' s manor . : 34.95666641342561
i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you ." elizabeth ' s misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention ! : 12.004461349536086
were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion . : 11.739549627273691
at that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion . : 12.48121446345881
their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! : 14.227289938025054
when first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . : 17.99146640558272
he found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty . : 13.98838101785047
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever . : 15.437337129120289
but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . : 17.653982679139737
when the gentlemen rose to go away , mrs . : 17.2407342140777
bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time . : 12.313652263410265
" you are quite a visit in my debt , mr . : 15.429236904439874
bingley ," she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned . : 13.1416861708577
i have not forgot , you see ; and i assure you , i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement ." bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business . : 11.427280501252367
bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a - year . : 10.707388723459585
as soon as they were gone , elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more . : 8.212037564933864
darcy ' s behaviour astonished and vexed her . : 11.923833520147353
" why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent ," said she , " did he come at all ?" she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . : 13.473251141132664
if he fears me , why come hither ? : 16.430138473464517
if he no longer cares for me , why silent ? : 16.145288605645245
teazing , teazing , man ! : 11.632606814639393
i will think no more about him ." her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than elizabeth . : 12.605189654160252
" now ," said she , " that this first meeting is over , i feel perfectly easy . : 12.826884661898916
i know my own strength , and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming . : 20.034059188214645
i am glad he dines here on tuesday . : 13.72260136775318
it will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance ." " yes , very indifferent indeed ," said elizabeth , laughingly . : 9.340795016326217
" oh , jane , take care ." " my dear lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now ." " i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever ." * * * * * they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday ; and mrs . : 10.307285930221646
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn ; and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time . : 12.4792069612429
when they repaired to the dining - room , elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister . : 13.533310030030155
her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself . : 12.222446071687108
on entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided . : 16.122126805099583
he placed himself by her . : 34.08054547529363
elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend . : 11.85433195616681
he bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr . : 11.605566064075482
darcy , with an expression of half - laughing alarm . : 14.557633795537036
his behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , jane ' s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured . : 12.56051759256484
though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour . : 12.61637665662671
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour . : 15.823206501117
darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them . : 18.448822974204177
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage . : 14.031959225108139
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did . : 12.103274893554174
her mother ' s ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth ' s mind ; and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family . : 12.193073124651631
she looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend . : 16.929848436861484
" if he does not come to me , _then_ ," said she , " i shall give him up for ever ." the gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas ! : 12.678214045054853
the ladies had crowded round the table , where miss bennet was making tea , and elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her , which would admit of a chair . : 11.53003485052648
and on the gentlemen ' s approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " the men shan ' t come and part us , i am determined . : 13.83062916365077
we want none of them ; do we ?" darcy had walked away to another part of the room . : 11.738004538938855
she followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly ! : 11.293047958074196
" a man who has once been refused ! : 17.274451938765846
how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? : 15.975499905787814
is there one among the sex , who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? : 14.13538527977135
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings !" she was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying , " is your sister at pemberley still ?" " yes , she will remain there till christmas ." " and quite alone ? : 8.977217012732075
have all her friends left her ?" " mrs . : 25.479549069231833
annesley is with her . : 17.093301492065276
the others have been gone on to scarborough , these three weeks ." she could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success . : 13.846124242241201
he stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady ' s whispering to elizabeth again , he walked away . : 22.67616211399077
she now lost every expectation of pleasure . : 22.752004992485535
they were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself . : 13.599097967775505
bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them . : 10.129003453410846
" well girls ," said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " what say you to the day ? : 17.569171814595663
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , i assure you . : 16.30805952611876
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw . : 19.286675497345435
the venison was roasted to a turn -- and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch . : 12.122913006904936
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas ' s last week ; and even mr . : 14.436692203173697
darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least . : 11.856118144737556
long said so too , for i asked her whether you did not . : 16.684940658896885
and what do you think she said besides ? : 26.361540265791383
' ah ! : 91.63499642649481
bennet , we shall have her at netherfield at last .' she did indeed . : 18.867505029440224
i do think mrs . : 31.49343329663018
bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of bingley ' s behaviour to jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals . : 13.600490508422201
" it has been a very agreeable day ," said miss bennet to elizabeth . : 22.276341540540958
" the party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other . : 17.17953974058178
i hope we may often meet again ." elizabeth smiled . : 20.472858342934668
" lizzy , you must not do so . : 27.465391868781108
it mortifies me . : 50.02521551827797
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it . : 9.827047418793947
we all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . : 11.985903603505829
forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make _me_ your confidante ." chapter xiii . : 8.758225549454977
a few days after this visit , mr . : 16.370005880337636
bingley called again , and alone . : 35.210976921542084
his friend had left him that morning for london , but was to return home in ten days time . : 14.411117553193273
bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere . : 15.699126379909528
" next time you call ," said she , " i hope we shall be more lucky ." he should be particularly happy at any time , & c . : 9.96141045203156
& c .; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them . : 10.975152298273203
in ran mrs . : 52.01183058384228
bennet to her daughter ' s room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , " my dear jane , make haste and hurry down . : 12.64930203775504
he is come -- mr . : 22.82626287078897
bingley is come .-- he is , indeed . : 27.05535998865699
make haste , make haste . : 21.151414924439724
here , sarah , come to miss bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . : 14.933865155839305
hang kitty ! : 20.969955621312565
what has she to do with it ? : 35.521132037111805
come be quick , be quick ! : 19.47035905838536
where is your sash my dear ?" but when her mother was gone , jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters . : 14.084969816539447
the same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening . : 18.671198150672552
after tea , mr . : 23.473226439043913
bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and mary went up stairs to her instrument . : 17.001299967510196
bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them . : 9.92957043361587
what am i to do ?" " nothing child , nothing . : 18.144741210831583
i did not wink at you ." she then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to kitty , " come here , my love , i want to speak to you ," took her out of the room . : 11.408372938394306
in a few minutes , mrs . : 20.55204535170689
bennet half opened the door and called out , " lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you ." elizabeth was forced to go . : 13.887674290800271
" we may as well leave them by themselves you know ;" said her mother as soon as she was in the hall . : 15.271565533621905
" kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing - room ." elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing - room . : 10.882347343591306
bennet ' s schemes for this day were ineffectual . : 14.362691213827645
bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter . : 13.510309424724086
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill - judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter . : 10.960515391522536
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and mrs . : 10.336540051382164
bennet ' s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband . : 18.433183047861668
after this day , jane said no more of her indifference . : 21.9779563554421
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley ; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless mr . : 10.260137267331803
darcy returned within the stated time . : 18.024869588764147
seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman ' s concurrence . : 13.370548525616817
bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and mr . : 16.670083760381168
bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on . : 23.396468485388116
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected . : 17.290714327528725
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him . : 10.57593071849913
bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening mrs . : 20.589145163931626
elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother ' s schemes . : 11.387072697027406
but on returning to the drawing - room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her . : 14.297631232235156
on opening the door , she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all . : 10.173169539318794
_their_ situation was awkward enough ; but _her ' s_ she thought was still worse . : 7.899315730656131
not a syllable was uttered by either ; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room . : 11.729529297157017
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world . : 13.377077910438935
"' tis too much !" she added , " by far too much . : 10.235614798617839
why is not every body as happy ?" elizabeth ' s congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express . : 11.176722725025098
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present . : 16.08262603792503
" i must go instantly to my mother ;" she cried . : 17.65040088449972
he is gone to my father already . : 30.966174658230535
lizzy , to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! : 16.566644627222274
how shall i bear so much happiness !" she then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with kitty . : 10.714519315727548
elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation . : 8.66083270397027
" and this ," said she , " is the end of all his friend ' s anxious circumspection ! : 17.168059254616164
of all his sister ' s falsehood and contrivance ! : 22.041676492190845
the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end !" in a few minutes she was joined by bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose . : 12.469031880140038
" where is your sister ?" said he hastily , as he opened the door . : 17.820341027679373
" with my mother up stairs . : 31.05646245879341
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship . : 15.40914443789775
they shook hands with great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of jane ' s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super - excellent disposition of jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself . : 10.792593005630696
kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon . : 11.591105550005548
bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was . : 10.741822381734945
not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " jane , i congratulate you . : 12.90562068925506
you will be a very happy woman ." jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness . : 16.710026380364603
" you are a good girl ;" he replied , " and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . : 12.894081416905003
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together . : 19.432347337829466
your tempers are by no means unlike . : 15.591088140907441
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in _me_ ." " exceed their income ! : 7.959810034908604
bennet ," cried his wife , " what are you talking of ? : 17.159638068765158
why , he has four or five thousand a - year , and very likely more ." then addressing her daughter , " oh ! : 11.117774267525405
my dear , dear jane , i am so happy ! : 18.331218666477007
i am sure i sha ' nt get a wink of sleep all night . : 6.57978057986351
i knew how it would be . : 38.18147479582404
i always said it must be so , at last . : 24.42025193662689
i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! : 18.462385814665673
i remember , as soon as ever i saw him , when he first came into hertfordshire last year , i thought how likely it was that you should come together . : 14.710067140986519
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen !" wickham , lydia , were all forgotten . : 14.95633254164553
at that moment , she cared for no other . : 25.60899130176635
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield ; and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter . : 12.254389346440995
bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept . : 9.313584778168888
i had not believed it possible ." " i suspected as much ," replied elizabeth . : 17.316455036421264
" but how did he account for it ?" " it must have been his sister ' s doing . : 17.734037047006307
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which i cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . : 12.403872368942107
good girl ! : 70.97582099271641
it would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of miss bingley ' s pretended regard ." " would you believe it , lizzy , that when he went to town last november , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again !" " he made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty ." this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities . : 11.074211137128302
" i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed !" cried jane . : 11.069716660040307
if i could but see _you_ as happy ! : 17.60656463188773
if there _were_ but such another man for you !" " if you were to give me forty such men , i never could be so happy as you . : 12.104870181107788
no , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if i have very good luck , i may meet with another mr . : 12.703631713875437
collins in time ." the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret . : 14.19868400537723
bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs . : 14.554118908672503
philips , and _she_ ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton . : 15.871633074423302
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune . : 12.146122329729
it was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours . : 18.674266776601073
the horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them . : 13.66628267225425
as it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery . : 13.182366158590495
they both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered . : 13.330428359033554
it was lady catherine de bourgh . : 22.98425499863166
they were of course all intending to be surprised ; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of mrs . : 14.817386598508344
bennet and kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what elizabeth felt . : 18.24386662244157
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to elizabeth ' s salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word . : 12.296950560239305
bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness . : 11.373817621018436
after sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to elizabeth , " i hope you are well , miss bennet . : 15.009951695767063
that lady i suppose is your mother ." elizabeth replied very concisely that she was . : 16.357831060445037
" she is my youngest girl but one . : 21.206103978884695
my youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who i believe will soon become a part of the family ." " you have a very small park here ," returned lady catherine after a short silence . : 11.185987424452788
" it is nothing in comparison of rosings , my lady , i dare say ; but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas ' s ." " this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full west ." mrs . : 10.876554348454704
bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added , " may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr . : 9.77717906714899
collins well ." " yes , very well . : 21.506500673466522
i saw them the night before last ." elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling . : 14.401761634784412
but no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled . : 18.78444776053181
i should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company ." " go , my dear ," cried her mother , " and shew her ladyship about the different walks . : 12.291735732032622
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage ." elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs . : 12.928458346659818
as they passed through the hall , lady catherine opened the doors into the dining - parlour and drawing - room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on . : 8.794141788700124
her carriage remained at the door , and elizabeth saw that her waiting - woman was in it . : 15.752837961955027
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable . : 10.502509430955637
your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why i come ." elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment . : 10.518246068313692
" indeed , you are mistaken , madam . : 28.62717795037208
i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here ." " miss bennet ," replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to know , that i am not to be trifled with . : 15.136356079918572
but however insincere _you_ may choose to be , you shall not find _me_ so . : 14.70097091972907
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , i shall certainly not depart from it . : 10.034800186733705
a report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago . : 13.54165516711781
i was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that _you_ , that miss elizabeth bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , mr . : 14.691675314509155
though i _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood ; though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , i instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that i might make my sentiments known to you ." " if you believed it impossible to be true ," said elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , " i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far . : 10.479504369598411
what could your ladyship propose by it ?" " at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted ." " your coming to longbourn , to see me and my family ," said elizabeth , coolly , " will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence ." " if ! : 11.88782524948398
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? : 24.433739078144736
has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ? : 13.509904861807064
_you_ may ask questions , which _i_ shall not choose to answer ." " this is not to be borne . : 13.205519772380324
miss bennet , i insist on being satisfied . : 21.510375639910524
has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ?" " your ladyship has declared it to be impossible ." " it ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason . : 12.600842037894616
but _your_ arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family . : 11.368700712703813
you may have drawn him in ." " if i have , i shall be the last person to confess it ." " miss bennet , do you know who i am ? : 18.4038909315435
i have not been accustomed to such language as this . : 14.126864264878382
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns ." " but you are not entitled to know _mine_ ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit ." " let me be rightly understood . : 9.775706249727461
this match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place . : 14.615000258189074
no , never . : 56.581603232412455
now what have you to say ?" " only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me ." lady catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , " the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . : 14.43544487873792
from their infancy , they have been intended for each other . : 18.084650228434604
while in their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family ! : 12.049751865621468
do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ? : 24.081997794482003
to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh ? : 17.821998741729065
have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ?" " yes , and i had heard it before . : 14.865927192973176
but what is that to me ? : 40.73672899219019
if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , i shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh . : 12.921232402081372
you both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage . : 20.113671054795816
its completion depended on others . : 15.255150053341724
darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? : 10.206252727854203
and if i am that choice , why may not i accept him ?" " because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it . : 8.609808225663082
yes , miss bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all . : 13.605861555044266
you will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him . : 14.563233266156356
your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us ." " these are heavy misfortunes ," replied elizabeth . : 10.660090293354182
" but the wife of mr . : 23.497262777655685
darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine ." " obstinate , headstrong girl ! : 12.056739557396703
i am ashamed of you ! : 43.466441831214134
is nothing due to me on that score ? : 26.049661588232606
" let us sit down . : 31.32812703582195
i have not been used to submit to any person ' s whims . : 16.76467898093462
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment ." " _that_ will make your ladyship ' s situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on _me_ ." " i will not be interrupted . : 11.519607924712759
hear me in silence . : 34.0216226655087
my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other . : 14.513285460135844
they are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father ' s , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled families . : 14.28772425058933
their fortune on both sides is splendid . : 13.354319184799396
they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ; and what is to divide them ? : 12.463058341545757
is this to be endured ! : 51.52490957167628
but it must not , shall not be . : 33.25670709661893
if you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up ." " in marrying your nephew , i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere . : 11.563004488573231
you _are_ a gentleman ' s daughter . : 26.187124954016
but who was your mother ? : 46.587486961533656
who are your uncles and aunts ? : 12.861454202141163
do not imagine me ignorant of their condition ." " whatever my connections may be ," said elizabeth , " if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to _you_ ." " tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ?" though elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine , have answered this question ; she could not but say , after a moment ' s deliberation , " i am not ." lady catherine seemed pleased . : 11.671986388632112
" and will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ?" " i will make no promise of the kind ." " miss bennet i am shocked and astonished . : 14.867917944959258
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede . : 18.381884453455513
i shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance i require ." " and i certainly _never_ shall give it . : 13.50678703755354
i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable . : 12.900011926502117
your ladyship wants mr . : 24.339527181230387
darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished - for promise , make _their_ marriage at all more probable ? : 9.307034557808802
supposing him to be attached to me , would _my_ refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? : 13.540171292860055
allow me to say , lady catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill - judged . : 11.207171676228578
you have widely mistaken my character , if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these . : 13.275296987654151
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs , i cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine . : 9.76581949792989
i must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject ." " not so hasty , if you please . : 14.422958264757517
i have by no means done . : 25.294032361021745
to all the objections i have already urged , i have still another to add . : 15.595858203695316
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister ' s infamous elopement . : 15.75021158911883
i know it all ; that the young man ' s marrying her , was a patched - up business , at the expence of your father and uncles . : 16.248385587147915
and is _such_ a girl to be my nephew ' s sister ? : 25.464552162912447
is _her_ husband , is the son of his late father ' s steward , to be his brother ? : 20.138202601113978
heaven and earth !-- of what are you thinking ? : 11.409062725277462
are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted ?" " you can _now_ have nothing farther to say ," she resentfully answered . : 11.46750042269656
" you have insulted me , in every possible method . : 23.819095351219495
i must beg to return to the house ." and she rose as she spoke . : 21.300911417501595
lady catherine rose also , and they turned back . : 18.320104475165966
her ladyship was highly incensed . : 25.440810043983554
" you have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! : 23.013958303388385
unfeeling , selfish girl ! : 12.05470411525837
do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ?" " lady catherine , i have nothing farther to say . : 14.142758750666742
i am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to _you_ , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me ." " it is well . : 12.809614646181753
you refuse , then , to oblige me . : 27.461129914974112
you refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude . : 12.952083117158411
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world ." " neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude ," replied elizabeth , " have any possible claim on me , in the present instance . : 14.085766536697431
do not imagine , miss bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified . : 14.253518414050342
i came to try you . : 34.8425951493807
i send no compliments to your mother . : 25.054117540561087
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs . : 15.159404550677722
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing - room , to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself . : 14.159316181715525
and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! : 17.19557115266593
for she only came , i suppose , to tell us the collinses were well . : 19.285732348188507
she is on her road somewhere , i dare say , and so passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you . : 14.446986358193135
the discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly . : 9.314066282627232
it was a rational scheme to be sure ! : 23.205774327681738
but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley , and _her_ being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea . : 10.85381638479474
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together . : 10.88547987896304
and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady catherine ) had only set _that_ down , as almost certain and immediate , which _she_ had looked forward to as possible , at some future time . : 8.258431405047364
in revolving lady catherine ' s expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference . : 12.469361407231903
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_ , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side . : 11.014409461600458
if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him . : 12.26170850439483
in that case he would return no more . : 19.890334284743226
lady catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way . : 12.054921263795796
" if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days ," she added , " i shall know how to understand it . : 12.145509779942552
i shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy . : 15.770185473215372
if he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , i shall soon cease to regret him at all ." * * * * * the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased mrs . : 10.225620460973344
bennet ' s curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject . : 12.259356791236314
the next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand . : 18.797871218280058
" lizzy ," said he , " i was going to look for you ; come into my room ." she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held . : 13.075074706322146
it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine ; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations . : 13.995882539332195
she followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down . : 24.206964144546905
he then said , " i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly . : 12.394132736637395
as it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents . : 16.64926765185765
i did not know before , that i had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony . : 16.064374342516714
let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest ." the colour now rushed into elizabeth ' s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , " you look conscious . : 11.42525567836489
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but i think i may defy even _your_ sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer . : 9.237302508776775
this letter is from mr . : 25.345309507326938
collins ." " from mr . : 35.644470051592236
and what can _he_ have to say ?" " something very much to the purpose of course . : 19.42435502571375
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good - natured , gossiping lucases . : 13.392501924581099
i shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point . : 12.696937894615786
what relates to yourself , is as follows . : 24.47390348030899
" having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs . : 10.235354754433759
collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another : of which we have been advertised by the same authority . : 10.671177180000598
your daughter elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this land ." " can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this ?" " this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire ,-- splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage . : 9.29290842619015
yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate closure with this gentleman ' s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of ." " have you any idea , lizzy , who this gentleman is ? : 11.502355184863243
but now it comes out ." " my motive for cautioning you , is as follows . : 14.34552131153974
we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catherine de bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye ." " _mr . : 13.766425099678063
darcy_ , you see , is the man ! : 23.74937818522994
could he , or the lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ? : 10.23120630379537
darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life ! : 12.315495878827425
it is admirable !" elizabeth tried to join in her father ' s pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile . : 10.564206150582164
never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her . : 12.292677750539866
" are you not diverted ?" " oh ! : 19.731345488094483
yes . : 134.35710631232098
i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned ." " mr . : 12.10516900794892
i must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . : 9.49929431734135
it was an encouragement of vice ; and had i been the rector of longbourn , i should very strenuously have opposed it . : 10.218924705142564
you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing ." " _that_ is his notion of christian forgiveness ! : 10.023991890830631
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte ' s situation , and his expectation of a young olive - branch . : 14.560516005614838
but , lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it . : 18.326783026922165
for what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ?" " oh !" cried elizabeth , " i am excessively diverted . : 12.206349979771915
collins ' s correspondence for any consideration . : 19.241685188173477
nay , when i read a letter of his , i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham , much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son - in - law . : 9.470806328926912
did she call to refuse her consent ?" to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it . : 9.521602316570506
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not . : 16.072024793931284
her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of mr . : 16.811393264899994
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr . : 10.85961658696948
bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine ' s visit . : 13.804850173217984
the gentlemen arrived early ; and , before mrs . : 22.759547665883492
it was agreed to . : 39.864935445801194
bennet was not in the habit of walking , mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together . : 11.24804477737016
bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them . : 12.94729961404486
they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy , were to entertain each other . : 21.489974872599404
very little was said by either ; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same . : 10.781398238863328
they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon maria ; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone . : 10.91237216636931
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , " mr . : 15.55329615818708
darcy , i am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much i may be wounding your ' s . : 12.384458292344478
i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister . : 12.531894653483711
ever since i have known it , i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it . : 14.199672890989108
were it known to the rest of my family , i should not have merely my own gratitude to express ." " i am sorry , exceedingly sorry ," replied darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . : 11.459629348987
i did not think mrs . : 30.92744509586009
gardiner was so little to be trusted ." " you must not blame my aunt . : 20.32182181539187
lydia ' s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , i could not rest till i knew the particulars . : 15.18174673333592
let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them ." " if you _will_ thank me ," he replied , " let it be for yourself alone . : 10.562632116511192
that the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny . : 15.395083257986474
but your _family_ owe me nothing . : 15.181152483731749
much as i respect them , i believe , i thought only of _you_ ." elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word . : 16.052429700969117
after a short pause , her companion added , " you are too generous to trifle with me . : 10.623404059464033
if your feelings are still what they were last april , tell me so at once . : 10.686788746435944
_my_ affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever ." elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances . : 9.063163956464473
the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do . : 12.53923921052459
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart - felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable . : 10.838514120717782
they walked on , without knowing in what direction . : 21.019844005739586
there was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects . : 23.108144827385594
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who _did_ call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship ' s apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which _she_ had refused to give . : 9.863759104906153
but , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise . : 15.801625313546136
" it taught me to hope ," said he , " as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before . : 15.701263928006604
after abusing you so abominably to your face , i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations ." " what did you say of me , that i did not deserve ? : 14.133565130732817
it was unpardonable . : 53.92445609239708
i cannot think of it without abhorrence ." " we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening ," said elizabeth . : 12.819705665595434
" the conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then , we have both , i hope , improved in civility ." " i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself . : 11.237572651058915
the recollection of what i then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me . : 17.456038383388087
your reproof , so well applied , i shall never forget : ' had you behaved in a more gentleman - like manner .' those were your words . : 8.150846105990006
you know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ;-- though it was some time , i confess , before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice ." " i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . : 11.422735634766896
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way ." " i can easily believe it . : 14.53336857876962
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , i am sure you did . : 12.271574143579176
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget , as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me ." " oh ! : 14.136675592533624
do not repeat what i then said . : 19.9797640923803
these recollections will not do at all . : 22.159963096791106
i assure you , that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it ." darcy mentioned his letter . : 15.199348803054873
" did it ," said he , " did it _soon_ make you think better of me ? : 13.423503736065781
" i knew ," said he , " that what i wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary . : 15.894062079093313
i hope you have destroyed the letter . : 24.357947164525307
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me ." " the letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , i hope , quite so easily changed as that implies ." " when i wrote that letter ," replied darcy , " i believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit ." " the letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . : 9.218832812014169
the adieu is charity itself . : 23.143172247590833
but think no more of the letter . : 34.51299157995484
the feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten . : 14.181637650364472
you must learn some of my philosophy . : 29.18629699731455
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure ." " i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . : 10.681015690196634
_your_ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance . : 12.819020564478468
but with _me_ , it is not so . : 26.61305872351652
painful recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be repelled . : 13.437270513779723
i have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . : 15.543156040377346
as a child i was taught what was _right_ , but i was not taught to correct my temper . : 11.743766185431772
unfortunately an only son , ( for many years an only _child_ ) i was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable ,) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own . : 7.902687541075404
such i was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such i might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest elizabeth ! : 13.920281414751766
what do i not owe you ! : 15.705519059207159
you taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . : 12.919038335788054
by you , i was properly humbled . : 32.92402461456601
i came to you without a doubt of my reception . : 26.32706008423787
you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased ." " had you then persuaded yourself that i should ?" " indeed i had . : 11.85843531402059
what will you think of my vanity ? : 38.67739699476311
i never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . : 12.496512829128552
how you must have hated me after _that_ evening ?" " hate you ! : 11.849774294505087
you blamed me for coming ?" " no indeed ; i felt nothing but surprise ." " your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you . : 10.557042548221627
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell , but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you ." he then told her of georgiana ' s delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend . : 9.243482991947335
she expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther . : 15.580679242043683
" what could become of mr . : 21.863884399925816
darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it . : 15.589305932547868
" i must ask whether you were surprised ?" said elizabeth . : 14.730092536938768
" not at all . : 40.65382226093154
when i went away , i felt that it would soon happen ." " that is to say , you had given your permission . : 17.508383741163268
i guessed as much ." and though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case . : 18.22695679824632
" on the evening before my going to london ," said he " i made a confession to him , which i believe i ought to have made long ago . : 15.371589592202964
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent . : 12.852481073952069
i told him , moreover , that i believed myself mistaken in supposing , as i had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , i felt no doubt of their happiness together ." elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend . : 12.272726296221999
" did you speak from your own observation ," said she , " when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ?" " from the former . : 12.142630632496266
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here ; and i was convinced of her affection ." " and your assurance of it , i suppose , carried immediate conviction to him ." " it did . : 13.292290130073136
bingley is most unaffectedly modest . : 18.747350775276402
his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy . : 9.962685449017416
i was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him . : 16.08782158559511
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that i had known it , and purposely kept it from him . : 13.791148159792241
he was angry . : 54.05941026454883
but his anger , i am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister ' s sentiments . : 12.443494673500009
he has heartily forgiven me now ." elizabeth longed to observe that mr . : 11.762262245379022
bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself . : 11.389031669530567
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at , and it was rather too early to begin . : 15.30869059802649
in the hall they parted . : 32.26385711880919
she had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge . : 18.117308958689783
she coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth . : 15.617058907278398
the evening passed quietly , unmarked by any thing extraordinary . : 15.512472120656724
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent . : 12.906026991225689
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ; and elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather _knew_ that she was happy , than _felt_ herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her . : 9.67153923056762
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away . : 11.704634534065386
at night she opened her heart to jane . : 19.678730931254442
though suspicion was very far from miss bennet ' s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here . : 13.125241461571711
" you are joking , lizzy . : 24.97085185251877
no , no , you shall not deceive me . : 22.663685021093666
i know it to be impossible ." " this is a wretched beginning indeed ! : 17.903377438474845
yet , indeed , i am in earnest . : 24.230887672349223
he still loves me , and we are engaged ." jane looked at her doubtingly . : 17.41583262834185
it cannot be . : 67.7272855229428
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now . : 18.289899641528873
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself ." miss bennet still looked all amazement . : 13.401423997085141
elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth . : 21.809350838396043
can it be really so ! : 21.5470246874709
yet now i must believe you ," cried jane . : 18.97957912397868
" my dear , dear lizzy , i would -- i do congratulate you -- but are you certain ? : 15.52932479131127
forgive the question -- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ?" " there can be no doubt of that . : 15.59178453279935
it is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . : 17.151052153732426
but are you pleased , jane ? : 35.308809726550024
shall you like to have such a brother ?" " very , very much . : 23.447127184680074
nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight . : 10.11648006638267
and do you really love him quite well enough ? : 22.061156285145024
oh , lizzy ! : 46.355236201367546
do any thing rather than marry without affection . : 15.88073777801839
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ?" " oh , yes ! : 15.066052376042908
you will only think i feel _more_ than i ought to do , when i tell you all ." " what do you mean ?" " why , i must confess , that i love him better than i do bingley . : 14.951524190739578
i am afraid you will be angry ." " my dearest sister , now _be_ be serious . : 13.496426496082936
let me know every thing that i am to know , without delay . : 18.862834284985446
will you tell me how long you have loved him ?" " it has been coming on so gradually , that i hardly know when it began . : 11.219541667934816
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley ." another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment . : 8.399149221484254
when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing farther to wish . : 15.056037606195208
" now i am quite happy ," said she , " for you will be as happy as myself . : 16.112383537233004
i always had a value for him . : 24.973937328258174
were it for nothing but his love of you , i must always have esteemed him ; but now , as bingley ' s friend and your husband , there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me . : 13.381072016894882
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton ! : 16.14228965905573
i owe all that i know of it , to another , not to you ." elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy . : 25.525481239090677
but now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in lydia ' s marriage . : 16.840605312906025
all was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation . : 21.517326953735974
* * * * * " good gracious !" cried mrs . : 6.701111305367281
bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable mr . : 14.46899287970731
i had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company . : 12.255188373989107
what shall we do with him ? : 43.24995528928307
lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley ' s way ." elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet . : 10.912855724405595
as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , " mr . : 11.407070697790894
bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to - day ?" " i advise mr . : 10.795980152818169
darcy , and lizzy , and kitty ," said mrs . : 27.51296134040189
it is a nice long walk , and mr . : 16.642732010951026
darcy has never seen the view ." " it may do very well for the others ," replied mr . : 15.298112280588592
bingley ; " but i am sure it will be too much for kitty . : 15.659898133707458
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount , and elizabeth silently consented . : 15.104657229979912
bennet followed her , saying , " i am quite sorry , lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself . : 13.473537541113773
but i hope you will not mind it : it is all for jane ' s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then . : 13.76424304355354
so , do not put yourself to inconvenience ." during their walk , it was resolved that mr . : 12.155641529095613
bennet ' s consent should be asked in the course of the evening . : 18.335785566685793
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother ' s . : 18.564368196237467
she could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man . : 10.778283195491559
but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that mr . : 12.104405586895526
darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation . : 18.155402209398567
* * * * * in the evening , soon after mr . : 10.211183110634057
bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr . : 21.232085596949226
darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme . : 14.418782016962602
she did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that _she_ , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr . : 11.058576647588048
darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile . : 19.393315053715362
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " go to your father , he wants you in the library ." she was gone directly . : 13.92902636759397
" lizzy ," said he , " what are you doing ? : 17.654832455829744
are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ? : 20.32162334161859
have not you always hated him ?" how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! : 10.202585662388165
it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to mr . : 12.870325544066725
" or in other words , you are determined to have him . : 22.75800934021387
he is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane . : 12.321244552073551
but will they make you happy ?" " have you any other objection ," said elizabeth , " than your belief of my indifference ?" " none at all . : 11.626099086639492
indeed he has no improper pride . : 22.05972279013159
he is perfectly amiable . : 36.766331217770066
you do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms ." " lizzy ," said her father , " i have given him my consent . : 11.582485200598365
he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask . : 15.34955573065208
but let me advise you to think better of it . : 20.730249725657533
i know your disposition , lizzy . : 27.26016747687088
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior . : 10.866189903215437
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery . : 15.163277336208493
my child , let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life . : 11.101286256015863
you know not what you are about ." elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that mr . : 12.240289231587417
darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ' s incredulity , and reconcile him to the match . : 10.089473576201017
" well , my dear ," said he , when she ceased speaking , " i have no more to say . : 15.645203747903134
if this be the case , he deserves you . : 19.88012444648272
darcy had voluntarily done for lydia . : 19.620265000087453
he heard her with astonishment . : 33.93798616850256
" this is an evening of wonders , indeed ! : 19.083442887999126
so much the better . : 25.454386710753276
it will save me a world of trouble and economy . : 12.14747339850964
had it been your uncle ' s doing , i must and _would_ have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way . : 11.062361208190131
i shall offer to pay him to - morrow ; he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter ." he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading mr . : 11.090713908234404
collins ' s letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go -- saying , as she quitted the room , " if any young men come for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quite at leisure ." elizabeth ' s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour ' s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure . : 11.783298708940736
every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time . : 10.22308640369926
when her mother went up to her dressing - room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication . : 15.500598125779439
its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , mrs . : 14.228202675216743
bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable . : 15.752736531127159
nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them . : 12.497129103706497
she began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself . : 11.80964658565026
" good gracious ! : 44.99202256508685
lord bless me ! : 20.76566108470889
only think ! : 76.27197167014008
who would have thought it ! : 38.419885823837
and is it really true ? : 42.45504945714258
my sweetest lizzy ! : 43.11676095704829
how rich and how great you will be ! : 19.034731919001416
what pin - money , what jewels , what carriages you will have ! : 14.560943282810438
jane ' s is nothing to it -- nothing at all . : 17.449836537250174
i am so pleased -- so happy . : 15.025121024878128
such a charming man !-- so handsome ! : 15.616363225506824
so tall !-- oh , my dear lizzy ! : 19.790209241648775
dear , dear lizzy . : 28.87657429666916
every thing that is charming ! : 32.78402928047108
three daughters married ! : 37.308490890224384
ten thousand a year ! : 19.446290131316072
oh , lord ! : 26.343054836632973
what will become of me . : 28.088102288640012
i shall go distracted ." this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away . : 10.54248039008624
but before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her . : 22.87491545270917
ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! : 15.679929189186055
' tis as good as a lord ! : 22.59625651460753
and a special licence . : 33.275869133256755
you must and shall be married by a special licence . : 18.880909442542155
darcy is particularly fond of , that i may have it to - morrow ." this was a sad omen of what her mother ' s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for . : 15.167020341874334
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for mrs . : 15.605080991229078
bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son - in - law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion . : 11.768251670037575
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and mr . : 13.818063805927874
bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem . : 15.231597032270528
" i admire all my three sons - in - law highly ," said he . : 10.011734632292317
" wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but i think i shall like _your_ husband quite as well as jane ' s ." chapter xviii . : 14.26355077243664
elizabeth ' s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted mr . : 12.404792055470832
darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her . : 14.870123622082005
" how could you begin ?" said she . : 21.751249241003734
" i can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ?" " i cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation . : 12.036619831312215
it is too long ago . : 31.181252473379736
i was in the middle before i knew that i _had_ begun ." " my beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners -- my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . : 10.836327278367751
now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ?" " for the liveliness of your mind , i did ." " you may as well call it impertinence at once . : 12.157904595932587
it was very little less . : 34.12786482119901
the fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . : 17.031257762582644
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for _your_ approbation alone . : 11.30382647330066
i roused , and interested you , because i was so unlike _them_ . : 26.05513287476597
had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you . : 9.732589979847345
there -- i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , i begin to think it perfectly reasonable . : 14.108205307034051
to be sure , you knew no actual good of me -- but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love ." " was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane , while she was ill at netherfield ?" " dearest jane ! : 11.235876826858899
who could have done less for her ? : 30.468143033312064
my good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last . : 9.893844130269247
what made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ? : 14.344316020529948
why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ?" " because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement ." " but i was embarrassed ." " and so was i ." " you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner ." " a man who had felt less , might ." " how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it ! : 12.779563354313966
but i wonder how long you _would_ have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . : 16.441180194479195
i wonder when you _would_ have spoken , if i had not asked you ! : 14.410648375809707
my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect . : 13.471673201007166
_too much_ , i am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for i ought not to have mentioned the subject ? : 10.019205195354735
this will never do ." " you need not distress yourself . : 18.2238238668268
the moral will be perfectly fair . : 35.06309092909013
lady catherine ' s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts . : 10.78841527045873
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . : 9.931780870555764
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your ' s . : 19.427468081625086
my aunt ' s intelligence had given me hope , and i was determined at once to know every thing ." " lady catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . : 14.448972074151154
but tell me , what did you come down to netherfield for ? : 24.08251030196788
was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed ? : 14.814338139449797
or had you intended any more serious consequence ?" " my real purpose was to see _you_ , and to judge , if i could , whether i might ever hope to make you love me . : 13.42016988342926
my avowed one , or what i avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which i have since made ." " shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine , what is to befall her ?" " i am more likely to want time than courage , elizabeth . : 11.316678259295578
but i have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected ." from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr . : 9.959388070692977
darcy had been over - rated , elizabeth had never yet answered mrs . : 12.835909526570912
gardiner ' s long letter , but now , having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows : " i would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as i ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ; but to say the truth , i was too cross to write . : 10.97677847073938
you supposed more than really existed . : 26.259166200508652
but _now_ suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err . : 8.434801783762522
you must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . : 15.218718397696911
i thank you , again and again , for not going to the lakes . : 23.81727252541743
how could i be so silly as to wish it ! : 19.843601676682866
we will go round the park every day . : 16.680422889806703
i am the happiest creature in the world . : 17.44116594998949
perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice . : 16.664935651429687
i am happier even than jane ; she only smiles , i laugh . : 17.125131148240264
darcy sends you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me . : 16.712402298985673
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas . : 18.49738093687705
your ' s , & c ." mr . : 12.9229681522925
darcy ' s letter to lady catherine , was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what mr . : 14.615749086658345
bennet sent to mr . : 28.61983049148873
collins , in reply to his last . : 32.68880616448703
" dear sir , " i must trouble you once more for congratulations . : 16.09354468159224
console lady catherine as well as you can . : 22.98819656383116
but , if i were you , i would stand by the nephew . : 23.5421982942952
" your ' s sincerely , & c ." miss bingley ' s congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere . : 13.228865206732058
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother ' s in sending it . : 11.92310961587265
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister . : 10.494491880729099
before any answer could arrive from mr . : 11.215032297013499
collins , or any congratulations to elizabeth , from his wife , the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge . : 14.049089803825318
the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident . : 19.231213299182162
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew ' s letter , that charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over . : 11.922623177455618
at such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw mr . : 12.416354180999493
darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband . : 14.444329921369874
he bore it however with admirable calmness . : 16.275229666100525
he could even listen to sir william lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st . : 8.99108476923742
james ' s , with very decent composure . : 14.5928054115282
if he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till sir william was out of sight . : 10.381416077892133
philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley ' s good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she _did_ speak , she must be vulgar . : 11.108629013190663
nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant . : 15.276818705983331
elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley . : 11.47723775590754
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs . : 16.056195557915306
bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters . : 15.957975913383269

darcy may be guessed . : 44.454199266228066
bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do . : 8.650283905964947
he delighted in going to pemberley , especially when he was least expected . : 18.715756596811893
bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth . : 17.40153888363681
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper , or _her_ affectionate heart . : 9.747479711722937
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire , and jane and elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other . : 11.793749707308667
kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters . : 14.123369424436778
in society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great . : 16.239543691884506
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia , and , removed from the influence of lydia ' s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid . : 10.807663056507776
from the farther disadvantage of lydia ' s society she was of course carefully kept , and though mrs . : 12.329553112495258
wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going . : 14.510680835166823
bennet ' s being quite unable to sit alone . : 14.724723285601982
mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance . : 10.706761046394258
as for wickham and lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters . : 14.292606581098466
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune . : 9.172691376154912
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished . : 15.76523231838223
the letter was to this effect : " my dear lizzy , " i wish you joy . : 14.902128484533169
if you love mr . : 27.049202890301377
darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham , you must be very happy . : 20.775965820471097
it is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , i hope you will think of us . : 18.172383416345173
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much , and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . : 10.476717970516109
any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to mr . : 13.987362038036508
" yours , & c ." as it happened that elizabeth had _much_ rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind . : 11.517523977997373
such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them . : 13.074739905803481
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their bills . : 8.443321979314462
their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme . : 13.82567738962434
though darcy could never receive _him_ at pemberley , yet , for elizabeth ' s sake , he assisted him farther in his profession . : 13.133087593262957
lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath ; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even bingley ' s good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone . : 10.690000136452085
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy ' s marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of georgiana , almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth . : 7.754158036751602
pemberley was now georgiana ' s home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see . : 16.43885935196223
they were able to love each other , even as well as they intended . : 17.92597412683408
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother . : 10.551850303545017
he , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry . : 10.159043877745152
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way . : 15.82632684656598
by elizabeth ' s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself . : 11.157429645074602
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end . : 11.097308100024076
but at length , by elizabeth ' s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city . : 11.051187052453171
with the gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms . : 21.772754667247554
darcy , as well as elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them . : 12.025885522562886
