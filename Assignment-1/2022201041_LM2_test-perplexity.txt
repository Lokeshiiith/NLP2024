wholly inattentive to her sister ' s feelings , lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one ' s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish . : 1318.0074944453322
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her -- that she was not enough recovered ; but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right . : 247.87333884617897
elizabeth ' s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another . : 381.8189864656389

in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ' s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr . : 175.12335981837708

having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity . : 468.3582257540188

such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude -- for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined . : 545.6880134862668

elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship ' s indignation would have been . : 172.86582518486472

philips understood from him what rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine ' s drawing - rooms , and found that the chimney - piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ' s room . : 218.10106310630886
his understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes . : 155.37711265629852

it was gratitude .-- gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection . : 1828.1689217542764
why must _she_ be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ? : 1102.5193948617282
he then said , " i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly . : 132.30611456681808

it had better have happened to _you_ , lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . : 542.8816705449684
collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend ' s dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power . : 351.63401967957407
it was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit . : 1432.1593465048254
resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment ; and i trust i am resigned . : 389.28010773412075
bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle ." " i should not be surprised ," said darcy , " if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers ." elizabeth made no answer . : 134.24549621511656

their sister ' s wedding day arrived ; and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself . : 119.79171009544314

the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_ . : 491.9759681190474
had colonel forster seen denny himself ?" " yes ; but when questioned by _him_ denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it . : 235.85745275765314

" i do assure you , sir , that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man . : 535.6270898679898
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy . : 804.0117151448851

" her daughter , miss de bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates ." this information made elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor miss bingley . : 214.3946874321131

he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune . : 403.6554904250935
" if it were merely a fine house richly furnished ," said she , " i should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful . : 222.64631543389575
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character ." " not as you represent it . : 138.29419502722362

he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it . : 937.1496356709944

" not that i _shall_ though ," she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out ." jane ' s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall ; elizabeth was glad of it ;-- till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante . : 323.8859494909731

darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .-- mr . : 775.172035819736
i wish i could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well - informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly . : 273.82086628131714
poor lydia ' s situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful . : 116.47890290023652
it is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side ." " very true , indeed ;-- and now , my dear jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ?-- do clear _them_ too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody ." " laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . : 304.8247551644866
that he was really fond of jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations . : 318.34327993542774
she remembered also , that till the netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking mr . : 659.6521924701613

it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do . : 310.36789055380194
sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance . : 337.19834892046634
bingley ' s regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham .-- the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained . : 361.5025405580431
collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure . : 195.4681659093247
it is such a spur to one ' s genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind . : 503.6034757200138
he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions -- about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr . : 418.3091377622106

but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present . : 132.81358752574764
darcy , you cannot deny the fact ." " i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party ." " true ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room . : 236.48600201409383
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine , frankly and openly ." elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " yes , you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_ . : 536.3741330367969

wherever you and jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of -- or i may say , three very silly sisters . : 484.0331895225208
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks . : 323.38790977712904
our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly ." elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness . : 275.0388406951404
i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . : 2977.753752484525
the day passed much as the day before had done . : 356.0266483942898
the subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away . : 282.9309717803333
all that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum . : 429.73083452663246
" what could he mean ? : 492.19049817278136
darcy said nothing at all . : 158.98193462634893
elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion . : 589.4303380915449
darcy could be so unworthy of mr . : 445.8097668724365
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore , stay quietly at longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care . : 199.35374764008253
when the tea - things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother ' s rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party . : 290.22557760511035

he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister . : 960.8966010612316

she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter . : 479.221904980009

jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london ; and when she wrote again , elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys . : 163.02713448681175

" if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapside ," cried bingley , " it would not make them one jot less agreeable ." " but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world ," replied darcy . : 356.2218872755008
miss bingley ' s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps . : 206.34402712015262

and it was not wholly without foundation . : 578.1416611757717
" who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ?" " his misfortunes !" repeated darcy contemptuously ; " yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed ." " and of your infliction ," cried elizabeth with energy . : 735.0377187916412
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs . : 1076.3496022928891

she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . : 237.61657434405225
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of mr . : 226.83318789565286

his disposition must be dreadful ." " i will not trust myself on the subject ," replied wickham , " _i_ can hardly be just to him ." elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , " to treat in such a manner , the god - son , the friend , the favourite of his father !"-- she could have added , " a young man too , like _you_ , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable "-- but she contented herself with " and one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as i think you said , in the closest manner !" " we were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care . : 392.69407801081127
but here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet . : 853.5739321671629

elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word . : 47.42477065253031
while the family were in this confusion , charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them . : 190.1490964730554
gardiner , " but perhaps to the lakes ." no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful . : 278.6953007989781
but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley , and _her_ being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea . : 360.71575975541975
as soon as they entered the copse , lady catherine began in the following manner :-- " you can be at no loss , miss bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither . : 149.0427423249446
" when _my_ eyes were opened to his real character .-- oh ! : 339.09940917371125

she saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown . : 618.8837160009151
on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .-- it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome .-- she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable . : 420.8616575021804

his letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution . : 1809.6944087498603

darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings . : 809.818909996403
here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery . : 987.9209217078975
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard . : 1491.0346386939912

at length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready . : 1021.0952413917536
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and mrs . : 203.2543761851868

they may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride ." " beyond a doubt , they _do_ wish him to chuse miss darcy ," replied jane ; " but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing . : 676.3945195664725
my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother ' s nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself . : 125.14331546611253

she opened the door , and met maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , " oh , my dear eliza ! : 279.9533365296002
but , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art ." " undoubtedly ," replied darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation . : 1353.9998787733414

is not general incivility the very essence of love ?" " oh , yes !-- of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt . : 391.87391012984
" i knew ," said he , " that what i wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary . : 162.105071295094
he was angry . : 2932.424020912955
bennet ' s eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , " well , jane , who is it from ? : 223.06339435087878
bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed . : 527.1230546758844
" you are too hasty , sir ," she cried . : 233.34502132122992
as a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people ' s happiness were in his guardianship !-- how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow !-- how much of good or evil must be done by him ! : 160.79695340500217
bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness . : 263.13082576224366
his words seemed to imply it . : 2421.6797400018145
" oh ! : 188.88037986813558
wickham ' s chief object was unquestionably my sister ' s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement . : 243.91523532421513
but lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . : 459.6494631185346
" his being so sure of succeeding , was wrong ," said she ; " and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment ." " indeed ," replied elizabeth , " i am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . : 257.95320932889194
what a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received ! : 591.7017008387817
the promised letter of thanks from mr . : 613.1650318906245
nothing could console and nothing appease her .-- nor did that day wear out her resentment . : 5083.746887361716
besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the ---- shire have left meryton , and they are going in a fortnight ." " are they indeed ?" cried elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction . : 217.99696829959552
without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment . : 267.64362218332855
respect , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown . : 1396.7091030297215

it is enough to know they are discovered , i have seen them both ----" " then it is , as i always hoped ," cried jane ; " they are married !" elizabeth read on ; " i have seen them both . : 167.6970947910028
bennet was stirring the fire . : 5562.232164117339
never mind miss lizzy ' s hair ." " we will be down as soon as we can ," said jane ; " but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago ." " oh ! : 181.03333201596746

the latter was thinking only of his breakfast . : 858.4792853019086

bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed . : 1137.7379642121998
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline ' s interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one . : 705.1822421926163
on distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities . : 369.56576514639534
but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill - success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment . : 1047.789169562073
it is impossible for _me_ to be impartial . : 255.25057516798034
what could your ladyship propose by it ?" " at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted ." " your coming to longbourn , to see me and my family ," said elizabeth , coolly , " will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence ." " if ! : 306.70463976993955
darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton ?" " with great energy ;-- but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic ." " you are severe on us ." " it will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed ," said miss lucas . : 351.9780363269203

my brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister ' s partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman ' s heart . : 543.8003338600118
collins was also in the same state of angry pride . : 997.2309006788286
when mrs . : 221.2172727171139
why was he to be the judge ?" " you are rather disposed to call his interference officious ?" " i do not see what right mr . : 610.409584255463
gardiner abused her stupidity . : 23598.34859018693
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers . : 420.19582822051217
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ; but he soon afterwards said , " i was surprised to see darcy in town last month . : 299.92466454902274
gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends . : 183.88809750743502
if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him . : 399.11816604562574
he was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again . : 181.66438615296244
but if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself ." " no , that i am sure i shall not ; and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical . : 117.47655917475602
and with no one to speak to , of what i felt , no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had ! : 338.86964915365206
they were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of pemberley might be something ! : 318.8616272138389
but when she read , and re - read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham ' s resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate . : 908.2487760113438
collins very gravely --" but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you . : 1002.4046827776306
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance . : 100.76365956359572
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way ." " i can easily believe it . : 91.67903290303525
everything wore a happier aspect . : 5385.293109818548
she liked him too little to care for his approbation . : 276.60804925514975
if _she_ does not object to it , why should _we_ ?" " _her_ not objecting , does not justify _him_ . : 1482.5865932921329
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had mrs . : 301.66308917100656
that such a consequence as _this_ should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts ." " when they all removed to brighton , therefore , you had no reason , i suppose , to believe them fond of each other ." " not the slightest . : 533.9448130218389
charlotte is an excellent manager , i dare say . : 391.7201003878895
had i known what i ought , what i dared , to do ! : 801.2477722931402
her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully . : 481.5154564128963
my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room . : 1949.5714277585935
if you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation . : 404.145259055888
" what can be the meaning of this !" said charlotte , as soon as he was gone . : 50.10833676236383
if i may so express it , he has a _right_ to be proud ." " that is very true ," replied elizabeth , " and i could easily forgive _his_ pride , if he had not mortified _mine_ ." " pride ," observed mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , " is a very common failing i believe . : 262.5063308061458
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . : 436.64115385068766
wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more . : 970.4951830862391
it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried . : 392.44641842531604
collins moreover adds ," " i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia ' s sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known . : 696.6868086481815
wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her . : 788.230829898603
she got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining - parlour . : 113.02163954388662
the first part of mrs . : 207.06950182285362
you thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! : 761.3923593703532
indeed he has no improper pride . : 2334.159355568072
bingley ." " i am sick of mr . : 70.59004608751097
i will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at longbourn ." a long dispute followed this declaration ; but mr . : 641.0514695349738
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your ' s . : 168.94274223250514
but elizabeth was not formed for ill - humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice . : 361.36102598604316
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from london , his five sisters and a cousin . : 735.5392753715104
sir , i do indeed . : 243.69832363914134
bingley likes ," said her mother resentfully , " since we are not to visit ." " but you forget , mama ," said elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that mrs . : 169.62145862011087
how can it affect them ?" " my dear mr . : 157.61456218818952
hang kitty ! : 23598.34859018693
darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident . : 837.4730958066253
<NUM> . f . <NUM> . : 2960.1531423663173
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible .-- i know it cannot be long ." he readily assured her of his secrecy -- again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away . : 558.8197201916691
pray do not talk of that odious man . : 399.8499709222485
i was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her . : 1652.2157596759646
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away . : 73.31034796440481
we have heard nothing from town ." " dear madam ," cried mrs . : 120.74757420727535
darcy replied with great intrepidity , " miss elizabeth bennet ." " miss elizabeth bennet !" repeated miss bingley . : 328.1339005719212
reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father ' s life time . : 184.69430501297802
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr . : 313.14123767410297
bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if i recollect right , he went but the day before . : 471.51868276879384
" i see your design , bingley ," said his friend .--" you dislike an argument , and want to silence this ." " perhaps i do . : 376.96580059513064
bennet ' s ill humour or ill health . : 1498.1596473003715
wickham . : 1446.9555207295125
tell her that you insist upon her marrying him ." " let her be called down . : 111.08426468576685
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham ' s departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment . : 259.697391579219
it has been my own doing , and i ought to feel it ." " you must not be too severe upon yourself ," replied elizabeth . : 63.151560967736216
wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited . : 623.227657934889
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery . : 764.8223307701387
yours ever , " caroline bingley ." " with the officers !" cried lydia . : 313.0402475390582
darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her . : 63.002334727590835
my child , let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life . : 701.531314029933
i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on . : 400.3391544581905
he really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger . : 259.50722127239555
darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ?-- poor eliza !-- to be only just _tolerable_ ." " i beg you would not put it into lizzy ' s head to be vexed by his ill - treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . : 317.87518032807367
with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . : 1187.2914951041541
bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication . : 587.0108308070833
and so , my dear sister , i find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen pemberley ." she replied in the affirmative . : 227.5272349913634
but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr . : 221.6869614946129
from their infancy , they have been intended for each other . : 379.5397268340913
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and mr . : 788.9400603486471
she had never perceived , while the regiment was in hertfordshire , that lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body . : 244.9603223654364
my father was not only fond of this young man ' s society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it . : 206.0353053690385
hurst and elizabeth herself . : 244.84510312333379
he was well , but so much engaged with mr . : 86.90502089163226
" aye , there she comes ," continued mrs . : 415.6147557235807
" i have an excessive regard for jane bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and i wish with all my heart she were well settled . : 222.9436179159311
wickham ' s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and mr . : 257.01919987855496
collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many . : 1830.6130906911728
they had long wished to see him . : 252.97273670507047
collins , or any congratulations to elizabeth , from his wife , the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge . : 323.3146311096927
you must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what i say . : 128.63250236619166
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of lady catherine ' s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough . : 253.22946203894483
they are my old friends . : 2967.991816836193
there was also a postscript to this effect . : 354.35673635817443
she had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome . : 1181.7697421702205
lydia -- the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , " i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern . : 438.7390854280855
collins on his return highly gratified mrs . : 804.7619372370508
" it would be nothing ; i could see him with perfect indifference , but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . : 93.75947608934341
jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved . : 514.6376715507895
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly ." " i can readily believe ," answered he gravely , " that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either ." " but if i do not take your likeness now , i may never have another opportunity ." " i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours ," he coldly replied . : 369.87189659121384
" your ' s sincerely , & c ." miss bingley ' s congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere . : 158.56659043253475
gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family ; jane heard them with horror . : 584.6220116850233
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat . : 198.9745227523185
when is your turn to come ? : 527.8794510403029
all connection between us seemed now dissolved . : 5220.047169728294
easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at rosings , which in so small a circle must be important . : 512.308638292038
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise . : 298.7310248484333
pray go to see them , with sir william and maria . : 411.0358236342099
" if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield ," said mrs . : 179.78880729173397
he was full of joy and attention . : 654.6084522141388
bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her . : 2410.171334775296
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr . : 222.1476003463055
darcy ' s letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend . : 153.4403818150564
but nothing can be done ; i know very well that nothing can be done . : 157.72387963544557
when mr . : 159.7524648089218
i hope we may often meet again ." elizabeth smiled . : 495.95952391005864
she did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that _she_ , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr . : 365.80977792466643
collins will be very glad of your company , i am sure ." " i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation ," replied elizabeth , " but it is not in my power to accept it .-- i must be in town next saturday ." " why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . : 149.22275219680404
gardiner ." " is it possible !" cried elizabeth , when she had finished . : 123.37721777089648
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband . : 624.7639731175786
darcy in a most infamous manner . : 817.6719551331735
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend ' s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible ! : 152.0374234413796
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother ' s indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ? : 290.4337798691579
it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy ' s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning . : 167.46598699764846
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , i assure you . : 360.34355305409815
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited . : 224.66487222511572
we must not all expect jane ' s good fortune ." " true ," said mr . : 82.14804065785215
but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and i dare say , very agreeable . : 184.2345232007495
and when i returned home , the ---- shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight ' s time . : 450.4054733547515
" i have just had a letter from jane , with such dreadful news . : 110.9267883796064
and poor mr . : 2572.6056132174936
you have no compassion on my poor nerves ." " you mistake me , my dear . : 104.24232658346926
my dear charlotte ,-- impossible !" the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied , " why should you be surprised , my dear eliza ?-- do you think it incredible that mr . : 441.26621847180024
but not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company . : 521.8066182731968
her hair so untidy , so blowsy !" " yes , and her petticoat ; i hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , i am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office ." " your picture may be very exact , louisa ," said bingley ; " but this was all lost upon me . : 768.902664028378
darcy ' s farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak . : 571.1882460297335
bennet ' s eyes sparkled .--" a gentleman and a stranger ! : 543.892841717804
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr . : 888.9141057959009
the fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . : 211.89298383621457
she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done . : 642.7543146670173
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them . : 1234.324987481805
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with " it is _your_ turn to say something now , mr . : 344.406074011094
his doing so drew her notice . : 5033.038871614291
she cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving wickham . : 232.08433176790984
bennet ! : 23598.34859018693
darcy appeared . : 910.0657131860289
and there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . : 314.97739808221576
but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render mr . : 987.0841107568012
international donations are gratefully accepted , but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states . : 564.531483443384
" i am astonished , my dear ," said mrs . : 33.94301578909088
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her . : 580.1365491694654
his character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr . : 557.7359461699457
he then handed her in , maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings . : 400.4057637937292
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes . : 309.8979449200579
he danced only four dances ! : 186.95058746596578
do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . : 594.958201291279
i am sorry to pain you -- but so it was . : 324.277420041877
i will take care of myself , and of mr . : 64.23299902294515
who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival !" " i am the less surprised at what has happened ," replied sir william , " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire . : 665.1216090133889
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command . : 238.07635495032181
her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them . : 529.0613411357502
darcy then was . : 1538.2371309615085
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem . : 191.87280820812896
there can be no love in all this . : 227.18998084963442
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation -- a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street . : 1222.4120059028946
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way . : 955.9599660218031
bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time . : 325.92388518503236
bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at netherfield . : 687.0533667859215

i told him , moreover , that i believed myself mistaken in supposing , as i had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , i felt no doubt of their happiness together ." elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend . : 129.4436672164059

if you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . : 167.0057094144083

when she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses ." " your plan is a good one ," replied elizabeth , " where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if i were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it . : 235.96835538103113
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley ' s dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady ' s side , the acquaintance would now be renewed . : 387.70625117354905
she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else ." " i deserve neither such praise nor such censure ," cried elizabeth ; " i am _not_ a great reader , and i have pleasure in many things ." " in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure ," said bingley ; " and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well ." elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying . : 283.7652046650712

he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within . : 671.8830220292464
when they repaired to the dining - room , elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister . : 188.37722982348387
elizabeth ' s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more . : 486.47278458276935

darcy .-- she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers .-- how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd !-- yet it did , and even a third . : 627.7066570661563

as a child i was taught what was _right_ , but i was not taught to correct my temper . : 855.4648623056404
darcy ' s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister ' s sufferings . : 314.2328631632519
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much . : 595.9296906206586
even elizabeth began to fear -- not that bingley was indifferent -- but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away . : 393.63326172451326
wickham began the subject himself . : 699.595308541194
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , " oh ! : 298.42732266621374
but she is too much like her brother ,-- very , very proud .-- as a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement . : 302.0059308740796
we have not met since the <NUM> th of november , when we were all dancing together at netherfield ." elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether _all_ her sisters were at longbourn . : 525.0262843281865

let me advise you then , my dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence . : 440.27858909608346
but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for _another interest_ in the affair . : 261.8733353054347
gardiner ' s long letter , but now , having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows : " i would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as i ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ; but to say the truth , i was too cross to write . : 335.06274568210137

she was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before . : 362.46705525677737
how well it sounds . : 10012.118948158457
another day i will do the same ; i will sit in my library , in my night cap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as i can ,-- or , perhaps , i may defer it , till kitty runs away ." " i am not going to run away , papa ," said kitty , fretfully ; " if _i_ should ever go to brighton , i would behave better than lydia ." " _you_ go to brighton !-- i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds ! : 506.0644125807826
the apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts . : 244.45455872888328

by you , i was properly humbled . : 1572.1987949447368
collins ' s making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted . : 305.5666019334973
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away . : 632.5240281430806

i must conclude , for i cannot be long from my poor mother . : 801.2718464630586
it was to this effect : " since writing the above , dearest lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but i am afraid of alarming you -- be assured that we are all well . : 356.3995862392231
why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ?" " because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement ." " but i was embarrassed ." " and so was i ." " you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner ." " a man who had felt less , might ." " how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it ! : 184.157233024366
it is of all subjects my delight . : 1192.160398777642
while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise -- all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible . : 530.2811045511311
my mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion !" " oh ! : 213.56989545409874
do not imagine me ignorant of their condition ." " whatever my connections may be ," said elizabeth , " if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to _you_ ." " tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ?" though elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine , have answered this question ; she could not but say , after a moment ' s deliberation , " i am not ." lady catherine seemed pleased . : 199.32608345030232
about the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon ." scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to rosings . : 659.6860708077844
darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure . : 354.8829514747827
darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house . : 376.77418161030465
he was always to have gone on saturday , and to saturday he still meant to stay . : 261.646157133766
wickham ," by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to mrs . : 202.75601619062311
every body said how well she looked ; and mr . : 256.2293811477779
what a stroke was this for poor jane ! : 1476.167700431513
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement . : 1160.070019284392
she is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but i will _make_ her know it ." " pardon me for interrupting you , madam ," cried mr . : 268.51618606973176
she was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when miss bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with . : 359.6696388872138
" she is happy , then ," said her father , drily ; " and her residence there will probably be of some duration ." then , after a short silence , he continued , " lizzy , i bear you no ill - will for being justified in your advice to me last may , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind ." they were interrupted by miss bennet , who came to fetch her mother ' s tea . : 198.57401800829638
bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy . : 324.1257922866985
the children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way -- teaching them , playing with them , and loving them . : 608.3662840627308
the first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , i had detached mr . : 634.4661735700362
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense . : 1913.9284474877804
gardiner could not be seen , and mr . : 57.282112497325386
i am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately . : 97.85799637979511
" why , my dear , you must know , mrs . : 44.49710661767255
it would have suited me in every respect ." " how should you have liked making sermons ?" " exceedingly well . : 697.385277611367
i would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day ." " then you would drink a great deal more than you ought ," said mrs . : 692.7060935482056
" to jane herself ," she exclaimed , " there could be no possibility of objection . : 518.1698010420666

i do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain . : 165.68541010872957

" yours , & c ." as it happened that elizabeth had _much_ rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind . : 274.4947943995632
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady ' s fair , flowing hand ; and elizabeth saw her sister ' s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages . : 459.4397882984008
hurst ." her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano - forte was opened , and darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it . : 140.49005271576306

he does not want abilities . : 1791.3211073881
collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh . : 664.4612907577723
this was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming . : 508.9584609489501
did you see it ?" bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations . : 347.10663292233994
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at , and it was rather too early to begin . : 885.2915829149201
though i _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood ; though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , i instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that i might make my sentiments known to you ." " if you believed it impossible to be true ," said elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , " i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far . : 193.6081972306153
but no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled . : 1069.4363316928848
pray read on ." " after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match . : 320.4794551804526
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty . : 472.7088812420163
denny , concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed . : 728.2530932259325
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had miss lydia bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house . : 312.2654216666685
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine ' s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte ' s observation , and hurried her away to her room . : 404.2091464876119
bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , darcy was continually giving offence . : 1648.0171503653144
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . : 997.4377700550682
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her . : 371.87687564618705
" i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself . : 257.54941835369806
collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance . : 693.0239093188336
collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings . : 1162.693451683872
" yes , she called yesterday with her father . : 419.1617368770147
gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece ' s beginning the subject . : 309.7283212205461
philips first brought her the news .) " well , so much the better . : 477.8137023199653
i know it to be impossible ." " this is a wretched beginning indeed ! : 154.9229458144558
your daughter elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this land ." " can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this ?" " this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire ,-- splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage . : 1130.4841907118712
on this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared . : 613.1668891350309
i will not tell you what it is . : 112.32623519243668
darcy , and mr . : 60.89543987019607
but who was your mother ? : 2238.0527953332517
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that i am not afraid of requesting it , though i have still something more to ask of the former . : 102.5117725697711
that he was _surprised_ by the connexion was evident ; he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with mr . : 258.6526203104505
" and then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over ." " i thank you for my share of the favour ," said elizabeth ; " but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands ." their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them . : 299.07993671352415
wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps . : 383.7941311740044
