Darcy was      punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the      wedding.:1214.3912889062378
No officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the village.:2091.35853952652
Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure.:99.29398971726822
Darcy_, you see, is the man!:593.5431690255266
They walked on, without knowing in what direction.:378.2111828506976
How was that possible?:6700.352445250327
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?"  "Oh, yes!:123.58910987429947
The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room.:220.9401199443344
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.:1487.18925019114
Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more.:1428.3586751053963
6.:359.83555515434426
Who would have thought it!:163.1535440141421
Mr.:279.6090698783234
I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement."  Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern, at having been prevented by business.:233.08603806591174
"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake!:654.9332534838966
Do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.:537.071785493941
Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria.:433.98564653266646
We seem to have been designed for each other."  Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.:404.4242243323963
She studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different.:704.8148510138858
They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve.:1425.5588245100569
Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.:131.55401680968066
When Mr.:162.81789735988934
Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.:375.641769911912
I congratulate her.:3317.035729886999
Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.:529.4638064120998
"Oh!:181.0230716258725
Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport.:467.0088114914352
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.:441.87616388368224
Bennet, "I am quite delighted with him.:35.87470336473091
Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters.:715.3156429974607
Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.:546.1331455100295
no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both.:413.7009371787343
They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.:387.1207149237804
Though Lydia's short      letter to Mrs.:283.8464433943379
"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to his friend within a few days," she added, "I shall know how to understand it.:118.18353181746076
James's, Sir William was so completely awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look.:268.34664421736164
"You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her.:164.97700742040078
CHAPTER II.:23456.03652377785
She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery      and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be      found.:676.1984247421237
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."  "Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any possible claim on me, in the present instance.:237.01270367908916
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.:520.7779749958729
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country town indifference to decorum."  "It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said Bingley.:556.6165038503237
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.:435.3033792186854
A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year.:45.37783192394389
Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world!:388.7134017596698
your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.--Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father.:1433.8432463564068
Our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character.:444.2616422438275
She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley.:142.91977167323472
Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter.:1251.7670826080944
Mrs.:279.6090698783234
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs.:146.59209946663967
She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter.:527.5636296635703
"Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room."  Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.:139.51236013047713
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother.:331.80566069662905
Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here, what he really is.:475.1883315944238
It is admirable!"  Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile.:563.779262310563
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one."  "You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.:321.59905862382755
She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give.:384.61982611128946
But I have other provocations.:2410.4883793566037
_My_ affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever."  Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances.:762.0748770985017
_Your_ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of ignorance.:729.3053655949337
"Oh!" said she, "I heard you before; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply.:60.0885427047938
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty.:500.74882902528327
She remembered also, that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr.:802.5857458642025
Darcy in any thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives.:700.7690180203033
"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again.:324.12061663370866
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two, who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time.:297.10995522561154
It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.:175.26595867461387
I believe I have now told you every thing.:107.89277648916652
Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer.:38.592937229326616
Little more than half a day's journey.:56.14150886446502
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing      concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and      suspicion certainly not in your inclination.:815.6769678370725
For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.:1789.4673434831705
I speak feelingly.:13679.45312687956
But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.:1040.8451015937285
I am sure you must feel it so."  "Oh!:50.78454244361052
"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.:140.869866569008
Collins's scruples of leaving Mr.:803.5859247334375
Wickham; no, I certainly am not.:493.63979768942784
I thank you for explaining it so fully.:1411.330107605141
The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt.:223.59550339196358
I must conclude, for I cannot be      long from my poor mother.:216.30675884933763
He      meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future      situation, he could conjecture very little about it.:383.48073247079043
I.:6577.572934320043
The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken.:1007.5314171153126
Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her--  "Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?"  She smiled, but made no answer.:208.39247234222367
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;      and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time.:1192.9641936596463
I cannot think of it without abhorrence."  "We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening," said Elizabeth.:535.4441155974798
On the very day of my coming      home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.:219.8315476511377
Bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of Jane's?:324.50736362383407
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon.:482.7853855248681
How well it sounds.:8671.095185110009
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way."  Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.:238.1513569673307
Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother.--When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.:268.58184120347767
Her affections had been continually fluctuating, but never without an object.:1404.7553242786244
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs.:872.8275635472305
Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.:1421.7980966174
Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.:264.8151416588117
Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London.:101.984321189437
In a doleful voice Mrs.:1897.9884806449838
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.:563.1347633198776
have you heard from my uncle?"  "Yes, I have had a letter from him by express."  "Well, and what news does it bring?:79.62225905465293
Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every body.:93.812093735938
The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay.:190.53219838430047
This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day."  "Oh, yes.:114.14521395694442
Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.:401.02278436289686
Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?:1341.9229162765478
They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.:1721.959317631705
"It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," said she.:118.5135074675023
Is _her_ husband, is the son of his late father's steward, to be his brother?:257.30185867236736
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule."  "And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, "is your opinion of me!:290.0426519831434
He was resolutely silent however; and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued,  "I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_ a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time."  "Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but _that_ was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."  He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.:401.3141339708453
Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.:242.94535690879206
Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,  "I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."  This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.:477.8917968334465
yes.:1529.906248285521
Darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again.:430.45548090159735
"This is an evening of wonders, indeed!:526.1432562821934
The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.:1417.4186294268816
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr.:68.27468590978987
Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.:230.94739187218468
Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.:219.76961798134684
But who was your mother?:2273.1720779041925
You must contrive to send somebody.:6546.586897148879
Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home.:153.4169036200675
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr.:252.59578629317568
My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.:135.44480126791436
Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_."  Mr.:166.24998301352937
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr.:153.21404658008908
"Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs.:5152.709278564173
For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof.:1600.9876906619138
I will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back again."  "Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him.:172.86323383030148
And one of my own daughters.:259.4932293523687
The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now."  "Indeed!"  "Yes--the late Mr.:195.03147037458197
Bennet, as he folded up the letter.:366.4845999110602
Did she call to refuse her consent?"  To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it.:879.0455163199207
The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation."  Mr.:617.542223613595
His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them.:157.03848807177337
"I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends.:119.2947277627658
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr.:140.43041196486627
It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened.:354.13439305841234
His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend.:675.0323268378047
_We_ were always good friends; and now we are better."  "True.:270.3133355511623
CHAPTER X.:23456.03652377785
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure."  "I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.:916.284389994005
Mamma would like to go too of all things!:1589.8147901247723
In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to Elizabeth, said,  "Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room.--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude."  Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.:219.46668224337972
"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer!:522.7600856169688
Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right.:1019.8933692173825
But I dare not hope it.:87.37189297995836
"It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.:94.9764704531068
And is _such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister?:216.65477763471918
Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them.:392.2652681487267
"And is this all?" cried Elizabeth.:264.48562563721896
A flirt too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.:1530.3894647556344
I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject."  "Not so hasty, if you please.:252.97675897003376
You know not what you are about."  Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr.:300.11181429297847
Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!"  "My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.:74.05879328801771
Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr.:306.2136174664952
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.:343.92975454658733
You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr.:235.73890144152307
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."  "You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr.:719.1400117224307
Such doings discomposed Mr.:3988.166484287738
Gregory B.:1401.127494709467
This, she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that Mr.:50.46794982116276
I hate such false friends.:6535.6402426575605
But you know married women have never much time for writing.:4418.3180657884
Hear me in silence.:392.8978738704758
Darcy."  "You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir."  "Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.:167.87821375450335
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery.:8622.0670137188
Let me hear what it is."  "We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.:77.19443195149674
In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his      studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all      restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.:1005.4261223931042
Darcy!--There is nothing like dancing after all.--I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies."  "Certainly, Sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world.--Every savage can dance."  Sir William only smiled.:915.641431460106
I am going away myself."  "No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.--I desire you will stay where you are."--And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added, "Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.:303.3594637012449
Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure.:283.67263566267644
What      he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress      will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest      way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again      to-morrow evening.:258.5233249636596
Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.:2091.5897191513054
Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.:1602.8934918969624
Elizabeth immediately recognising the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she expected.:1612.7796001389484
They were to be off as soon as possible.:56.280066775363125
Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's visit.:307.52804902663996
It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard."  "Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!"  "He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty."  This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities.:283.2638277631696
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.:1179.6719369962673
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr.:238.19986351887943
A person may be proud without being vain.:1158.5724000309147
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband.--It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.--She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable.:404.494320695598
Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.:312.04407287483275
Bennet;--she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so.:177.1309888371139
He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country.:314.33850254584405
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.:993.1738520642898
She approached, and saw the likeness of Mr.:372.1886343141808
Darcy half as well as I do my dear      Wickham, you must be very happy.:72.43427052044123
I hope she will turn out well."  "I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."  "Did you go by the village of Kympton?"  "I do not recollect that we did."  "I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had.:173.02331263548143
I know your disposition, Lizzy.:509.4851919355276
Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home, instantly.:1459.5454447908805
Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.:1077.2872055042667
If _she_ does not object to it, why should _we_?"  "_Her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_.:1423.524001476086
The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention.:559.0167525291203
The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which Mr.:306.53326065467866
The motive professed, was his conviction of its being      owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well      known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,      to love or confide in him.:298.1893493983801
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.:617.5626408705962
"There is also one other person in the party," he continued after a pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?"  The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.:272.92868345016916
Well, but now for my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?:431.44404640791566
Their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection.:811.7416966605956
Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.:299.7732205518682
I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night.:1477.796098309277
Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation, &c.:74.31209983597562
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country." He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.:253.65956822923584
Bennet were dead.:1484.5713725982355
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.:1279.5861045991812
There can be no occasion for your going so soon.:113.15478856651366
Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.--How could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been.--Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane.--She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility.:300.0063526333822
Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.:122.05945876942101
And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply.:1216.4250027324763
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could      so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed      seeing him, till after the departure of the former.:474.45707148058824
Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently.:4144.631233765003
"Oh, Jane, take care."  "My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now."  "I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever."         *       *       *       *       *  They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs.:90.44031601025434
Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland."  "Oh!:62.02706858872537
It was over at last however.:1162.0368089132273
But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.:260.3954125072996
Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.:293.0328527585139
There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs.:277.7529369318681
Its completion depended on others.:1996.7677631061104
Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.:129.8049988446699
CHAPTER XVIII.:126.15819532275205
As a child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my temper.:813.2191407974937
"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs.:179.6343389168144
They are not married,      nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are      willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on      your side, I hope it will not be long before they are.:141.6052232958424
I _must_ have employment and society.:23456.036523777893
I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done."  "My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do.:424.6504714608359
Darcy.:1922.4540853294795
"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--Oh!:248.83550758286913
They were off Saturday night about twelve, as      is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at      eight.:3570.051265812658
Philips's manners and politeness.:381.93285829955937
It became her turn to listen.:1647.2952813471866
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs.:87.66613211755359
Have you had any flirting?:2167.208898583993
I wonder what he can be doing there."  "Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said Elizabeth.:223.05468618511904
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be renewed.:380.19227578847034
"Very well.--That reply will do for the present.--Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.--But _now_ we may be silent."  "Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"  "Sometimes.:1146.4107839024296
"Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, "and what do you think of my husband?:54.545426708012805
My friend has an excellent understanding--though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr.:304.6308252071344
After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr.:492.5439816203759
And pray what sort of guardians do you make?:827.331994044425
Oh, that I knew how it was!"  But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour.:769.7113737495165
I _should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."  "Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."  "Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.:118.73931064494155
He has not an ill-natured look.:412.76871807650315
Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose."  "Good God!:666.7128252118275
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of.:264.445239997975
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.:1975.8611767094217
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.:473.52948065525436
Bingley's first choice."  "Yes;--but he seemed to like his second better."  "Oh!--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice.:223.15680931839032
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money.:1154.3596956744962
And if you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."  "You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan."  Lady Catherine seemed resigned.:233.4700533059998
Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.:432.0943085635125
Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the case?"  "In the first place," replied Mr.:168.4696059141121
The letter was to this effect:       "MY DEAR LIZZY,       "I wish you joy.:23.582796523627994
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself.:779.4851978609328
He owns it himself without disguise."  "No"--said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension.:800.9929642676899
But, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.:94.80207398244694
Wickham, when she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.:1094.6165521116288
"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared.:258.3835603150764
Far be it from me," he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter.:580.136553083735
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.:169.97755569668266
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.:764.7703344787591
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.:313.09531719500933
It was a rational scheme to be sure!:1032.9825467063436
it is just as he chooses.:560.058834192787
She had a sister married to a Mr.:474.9759720440741
Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.:221.94959672642267
Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.:2311.0544742424113
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.:126.63157799529984
Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr.:1256.6301512921636
If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy!:477.28623272880503
But I am at his disposal.:143.3150626459322
Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.:613.6268481704582
Risk any thing rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence."  "Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.:184.44826938802635
If I have wounded your sister's      feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which      governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have      not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more      weighty accusation, of having injured Mr.:787.0278142012673
Wickham.:1301.9808711477392
She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice.:228.66183004466222
and Mrs.:264.0192606167906
When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers Mr.:587.5457887322005
Darcy has never seen the view."  "It may do very well for the others," replied Mr.:309.59979893500775
When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs.:758.9492053720244
W.:279.6090698783234
"Good Heaven!:1304.3533012403486
Bingley is come.--He is, indeed.:404.50102060028973
She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.:231.5210734873659
Darcy!"  "It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many generations."  "And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books."  "I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these."  "Neglect!:315.33137828878347
Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family.:971.3924197274638
He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.:396.4335436592701
Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.:364.6360892418823
They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.:677.1189143239869
It was dated from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--       "Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the      apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments,      or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to      you.:600.3065626453262
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention.:112.35882784056064
I do not believe she often sees such at home."  "The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger." Mrs.:236.6243714969536
CHAPTER XIV.:23456.03652377785
They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.:187.6152537232772
And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,  "The men shan't come and part us, I am determined.:148.32105518111047
Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon.:2257.719424181134
No      arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe      a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that      must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind.:1002.6061861782814
Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.:323.75980339649243
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.:427.40488485342274
Lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off.:288.0756957020283
Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.--If it be not so, let Mr.:900.1099707474738
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule."  "Such as vanity and pride."  "Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.:746.1106107246815
But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr.:709.1827612407322
and having to relate such a thing of his sister!:647.3410770163115
_I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united."  Mrs.:251.6657810984295
At present I will say nothing about it."  "You are quite right.:38.41682736551246
Gardiner, "but perhaps to the Lakes."  No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.:296.4045960662784
Haggerston has our directions, and      all will be completed in a week.:1163.2381003081243
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,  "Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.:271.2485595186184
The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister.:695.8953439308958
CHAPTER IX.:23456.03652377785
I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them."  "I am not now to learn," replied Mr.:90.6305094681603
We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.:738.2411745085367
Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence.:646.975345864499
I was ready to die of laughter.:892.5076894675651
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.:464.1595694915085
_His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out,  "What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?:307.8532854234465
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire."  "With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it."  "I am talking of possibilities, Charles."  "Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation."  Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr.:367.0242714006768
"She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."  "She is a very fine-looking woman!:185.8014189326575
Will you come and see me?"  "We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."  "I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.:140.5354371981878
Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.:606.977640815689
1.C.:117.00837226848914
At length, however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.:180.02086939316297
Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs.:1091.6773825769108
I will put on my things in a moment.:650.2024174037147
Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.:2041.4031678103547
She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved."  While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas, who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had done to his presentation at St.:254.34176974524303
Respect, esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown.:838.4984422698182
These recollections will not do at all.:189.76129512144587
But slyness seems the fashion.:7222.479717636333

This however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors.:328.3382285491003
James's.:55.148571689997176
Bennet half opened the door and called out,  "Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."  Elizabeth was forced to go.:47.37054909308894
Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.:513.09419462909
It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.:460.7749607929079
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.:245.20906076726905
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.:669.2086953409848
He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.:10029.848858961463
"If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs.:173.2474142028726
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.:822.6629650959791
Jones says we must not think of moving her.:1038.1447514634103
His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!:1032.1629064906026
Bennet, for any thing about the entail.:124.94754711540864
I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her.:2253.731638452528
She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of preaching before her.:338.3189744278028
Bennet's eyes sparkled.--"A gentleman and a stranger!:491.71596195537757
They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."  "Aye--that is because you have the right disposition.:306.13189918138215
You have employed your time much better.:1244.6880176394104
I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly.:831.5511856252609
Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."  "I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.:202.469826804212
And who knows what _may_ happen?:5343.739142079742
They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs.:884.1077864806404
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.:276.08924800977866
How is such a man to be worked on?:154.5771689959022
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured.:660.4605052781925
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."  "My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London."  "Has your governess left you?"  "We never had any governess."  "No governess!:502.1706985021114
Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself."  She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her.:367.9151392029088
The rector of a parish has much to do.--In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron.:509.2373139259843
It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs.:122.6288279185467
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life."  "I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak what I think."  "I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.:193.88169535282745
I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.:97.7163702248806
I shall never forget her appearance this morning.:407.26407610513473
His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.:620.8542368310817
Bingley's friend, without being heard by either of them.:68.01964761304227
To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own.:499.09018801984234
Let me hear      from you very soon.:187.34022570225915
Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection.:953.8842517932351
Bennet?"  "Yes, or I will never see her again."  "An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.:149.66857858460864
Newby      Chief Executive and Director      gbnewby@pglaf.org  Section 4.:3093.9894192753654
They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.:6623.531956231742
But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.:1049.2842566589368
But of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.:655.7623503020291
Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.:393.8397172269813
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.:177.20074814354572
She was no sooner in possession of it, than hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.:208.54797699729994
But our visitor      was very obstinate.:8342.913213257958
The party did not supply much conversation.:1681.3289019472386
He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.:649.9001197739751
Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.:239.1346841644615
She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.:644.1565922470068
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.:334.6417063802018
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?:316.86623107730765
Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.:372.8890726204078
Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs.:103.40959803193778
Wickham, who left      the place immediately, and Mrs.:182.94148652927112
That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations.:316.97697468702154
There's for you!:772.7999788709874
We have reason to imagine that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye."  "_Mr.:192.1778069812104
Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.:430.8271625759237
He was on one side of her mother.:88.2300217046725
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr.:356.8158142371551
"He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner?"  Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.:270.22663132033404
Thank God!:23456.03652377785
But _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a      loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible      flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me      actually married, you cannot greatly err.:1291.3480490007796
On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided.:257.723510965257
Wickham is by no means a respectable young man.:295.8153125978736
Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.:532.700848824712
Collins very gravely--"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you.:1167.6925010709426
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away.:56.9872000362286
From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day      after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting      for them.:621.7160498028262
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship.:787.9892796072846
Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten."  "Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor I, nor any body, can ever forget.:888.6273650267591
She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.:649.0512586178236
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.:137.270999033258
I have not been used to submit to any person's whims.:155.97018289900365
But now she would no longer conceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage.:198.62193107046232
"I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_."  "Dining out," said Mrs.:330.6056033550428
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable.:509.5913485630237
I should infinitely prefer a book."  But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.:914.0499392649273
When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.:101.70601495955924
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman."  "But you see that Jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt."  "Of whom does Jane ever think ill?:145.35986321103337
Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,  "Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?:150.73019233258114
Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my      sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot      help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a      strong inducement.:262.4508390974427
single, my dear, to be sure!:119.82509037302415
Wretched, wretched, mistake!"  Darcy made no answer.:1027.1901182519373
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.:575.1022131800402
She was then but      fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her      imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to      herself.:262.562962246999
In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.:99.75746571481407
"What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment.:174.04402456578444
"Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself.:98.86286400147097
"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever lived.:111.1255852137713

When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr.:414.9447479121057
The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.:1454.2016996062991
She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.:1493.1217003355548
shocking!" cried Miss Bingley.:158.0212845953173
He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.:395.2129147796858
Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before.:489.72193660846733
In Three Volumes.:15797.782527096602
But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.:446.2526875739364
She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.:303.67802748606135
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her replies.:472.89654530263164
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention.:216.7219220785275
I cannot quite agree with you _there_.:1009.1166641445999
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic.:945.1702409940444
hang Kitty!:23456.03652377785
"Did it," said he, "did it _soon_ make you think better of me?:208.35903445223187
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr.:994.3597847168683
Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor.:819.578620609077
"That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance.:269.9972845205674
Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them."  "If you _will_ thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone.:186.53742553413645
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.:1152.8729736674543
Bennet's expectations were fully answered.:1425.74745400491
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour.:848.9982868651748
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.:587.1389968360429
His disposition must be dreadful."  "I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham, "_I_ can hardly be just to him."  Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his father!"--She could have added, "A young man too, like _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented herself with "And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!"  "We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.:353.63028354327054
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you.:212.65768181032814
Is there nothing you could take, to give you present relief?--A glass of wine;--shall I get you one?--You are very ill."  "No, I thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.:735.0518464013636
in every view it is unaccountable!"  "My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.:125.93972119697966
The next was in these words.:373.6399040838007
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.:718.824628529738
"Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"  "From the former.:319.60870133972577
It was unpardonable.:574.7391761024395
Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.:209.3888168659037
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner:--  "You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither.:266.9209330132701
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.:4312.471467087642
The one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago.:651.7495199543688
Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father, would always prevent his exposing the son.:209.57108859389822
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.:478.68336143243505
If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.:281.4705197590506
Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.:292.1310472148489
I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference.:267.69882353577816
1813.:359.83555515434426
I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.:474.2184069133653
He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,  "That will do extremely well, child.:202.65135562678353
Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte.:1383.9462226702415
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess!--I never heard of such a thing.:217.70467594830947
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of      the kingdom.:222.55414957148696
She was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before.:355.91253637012187
But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments.:372.3269104767126
Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this.:325.73962992445604
Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl.:360.74704699165864
He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in an hesitating manner how long Mr.:751.2278545513142
There are a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.:171.85969447333147
It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be remarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham.:325.50554321305594
unless a copyright notice is included.:18765.354905765304
Bennet followed her, saying,  "I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself.:201.98776966530315
But it is all, all too late now."  "I am grieved, indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved--shocked.:304.2133245037319
But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too much.:227.9200152348346
All loveliness and goodness as she is!:1198.364569000412
Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.:280.9212355707353
CHAPTER XIX.:23456.03652377785
Charlotte the wife of Mr.:172.02036142467134
Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.:614.1164440592836
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.:175.76622045097832
Bingley's conduct to design," said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.:331.11169008437076
A little time therefore.--I shall certainly try to get the better."  With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to any one but myself."  "My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good.:167.6351502135933
Darcy, and Mr.:57.46499776142494
He resigned all      claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could      ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three      thousand pounds.:262.4944876268898
Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,  "Do not make yourself uneasy, my love.:146.98637832639915
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world.:323.29270912035076
Darcy had been at her sister's wedding.:115.2344756185287
Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?:261.0074996547695
And when I returned home, the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time.:463.8433209679389
so tall!--Oh, my dear Lizzy!:439.3184492662098
Collins made his declaration in form.:4004.0665882491894
The distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles.:1917.3477256209885
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with  "It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr.:315.26151146675534
I am only ashamed of his asking so little."  "And they _must_ marry!:501.6851446754509
Your's, &c.:29.03206714842537
I am so grieved for him.:145.53974312849257
Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, "as ever I saw.:81.2168262350639
certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with.:643.7677986843228
They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride."  "Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy," replied Jane; "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.:480.06597304117713
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too!:292.5948848398147
You may imagine what I felt      and how I acted.:408.8850033094474
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr.:166.44962061895902
But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.:124.25723281022792
You alluded to something else.:872.8607954034985
Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth.:679.9422639276473
Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's, Mr.:88.81876998727029
Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.:268.15269871787257
Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do."  "And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason.:387.25906592364805
Why should they try to influence him?:926.5532710798675
But that is not the case _here_.:574.0767846328577
Gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated.:650.5733617915937
We must have Mrs.:284.5229448739998
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr.:903.7567138489749
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance.:1166.2745172377076
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.:295.7102752247654
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week.:470.8812307050834
Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was at any rate, a ball.:190.1035920222019
I was in the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun."  "My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.:621.1816006878934
To be sure London was rather thin, but however the little Theatre was open.:1389.3393074600444
"Can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated.:302.6494840046198
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing      but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed      him to act as he has done.:304.9146370426631
It was Mr.:436.7228527289316
And so, you like this man's sisters too, do you?:462.36221099772644
Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels.--Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed.--Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons.:1062.0539872105305
"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London.:357.208549767963
Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.:282.5076345807802
Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St.:158.41178433647926
She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour.:139.2829163899172
Bennet, "and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.:1207.6652975113473
"Books--Oh!:1656.2260846340291
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.:189.47678847328078
In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger.:362.61698877134313
His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards Mr.:579.4750041262843
They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!:448.6772112186562
She must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.:1530.4368571212344
Darcy!:23456.03652377785
In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgment of her situation.:460.33469266576833
And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.:472.7122007374338
If I was to go through the world, I could not meet with a better.:101.63391732617556
You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.:866.491104752078
Bennet protested against any description of finery.:4391.506624806064
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,  "So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!--Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.:199.318210397057
Very nonsensical to come at all!:1352.7610399877103
Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.:1226.7972127427429
The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs.:288.6718334087979
But pride--where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."  Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.:1231.4875401582246
Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying,  "There are very few people of whom so much can be said.:223.814176092487
Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.:222.43785912655588
Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?"  "I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future.:292.2671716331188
Believe her to be deceived by all means.:155.26716188296882
You take delight in vexing me.:2513.849494402401
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope, though you have but a short lease."  "Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes.:367.1487425755284
The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year.:1694.6141173636656
To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever.:1950.2668681716107
Bingley never stirs without him."  "So much the better.:245.29827914977886
CHAPTER XVI.:23456.03652377785
Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States.:157.61589381051837
Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire.:535.7680261444771
What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have!:2146.3138673069425
how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a like manner.:332.30957742451227
From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.:342.61957826320304
Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."  Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.:318.08314146219186
Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.:423.5153185626862
Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.:212.44974006479114
Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity.:513.8689604504901
Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every where.:9613.800877943802
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs.:302.18430457329043
Annesley is with her.:1604.088131146272
"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she.:89.8741081836253
It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration.:307.7651204910178
_My_ father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr.:1469.0547060545875
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you."  "Which do you mean?" and turning round, he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, "She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.:650.5125010164226
Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma?:377.78309802401037
Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.:166.40386760522202
"Yours, &c."  "Well, my dear," said Mr.:17.814712302315304
No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it.:167.48200450221105
Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was only exceedingly shy.:133.97935738627467
Gardiner.:23456.03652377785
But      last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.:2995.88295225177
Bingley," she added, "for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned.:114.11563690308289
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court."  "Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament.:981.9151226520213
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.:568.5351736697434
When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.:148.78363831450423
But it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."  "I see no occasion for that.:78.52128300133397
Let me never see either one or the other again!"  Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover.:919.7216156263956
He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.:506.97918336347715
Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way."  As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth.:294.86575217984404
But the clothes, the wedding clothes!:570.6313459834885
Good girl!:693.1009087479382
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs.:350.73442544306
"I hope, my dear," said Mr.:29.61793243421504
But      it was two or three days before he could get from her what he      wanted.:198.95281659189152
They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.:997.4828263472473
Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family.:1120.0847426135651
It is of all subjects my delight.:1163.8059867923357
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.:577.723392018516
Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party.:193.25160823691382
'Lady Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"  "Yes, Ma'am, all."  "All!--What, all five out at once?:338.0919422910037
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.:648.436651293025
Since her father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education."  After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying,  "I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr.:289.84342857449315
Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred.:2512.7206675091975
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?:2279.61049497096
GARDINER."  Mr.:151.50471643724987
The old lady is Mrs.:2097.177271571689
You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.:412.84275851618946
It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.:171.116266068259
The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.:511.8796171688404
Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.:269.7021031904891
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr.:105.84195098268613
Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr.:2433.505625934475
The tête-à-tête surprised them.:157.0326579121807
I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.:694.6945002688477
She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.:419.5515282561041
If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity unblemished could make him.:402.52173196955084
When Mrs.:323.5753441669749
Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr.:124.52689413133155
Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr.:229.0767615335954
That he has neither integrity nor honour.:4725.02113476244
His family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion.:676.726651083564
And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them, after they are married.:369.4521926115633
&c."  Mr.:21.719651763563494
Smiles decked the face of Mrs.:794.1810841707733
The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.:372.03434540183343
He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.:299.7048326725777
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.:196.86744425261676
Hurst and Miss Bingley.:39.95726527312391
Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself.:233.26094960923638
She enquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice, as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry.:298.5756897041629
Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation.:259.4931149109028
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body."  Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr.:453.2805715281248
Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.:630.1720951384069
I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him.:498.0272134131139
Bennet had been down stairs, but on this happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high.:341.16373507892183
As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, "Mr.:155.94968619138692
"How nicely we are crammed in!" cried Lydia.:1069.4303967570083
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.:1253.738554445319
With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs.:595.3692620586343
Bingley.:1331.9560125237554
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but Mrs.:551.5402256874036
Bennet and Mrs.:229.0355171991105
He was angry.:2488.214164818305
You shall hear what she says."  She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr.:555.643445808264
"Gracechurch-street, Sept.:536.3434205294221
He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it.:157.28963363754164
With _them_ he is remarkably agreeable."  "I do not believe a word of it, my dear.:97.91823254574722
If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.:757.8170278872367
He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.:225.83805555946552
I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now.:176.65865747743058
"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte,--"you must be surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr.:333.4537830855099
You must not disappoint your father."  "My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."  "Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."  "Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.:172.9037182986731
Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service.:445.0776179326174
Forster, the delight of Mrs.:417.4347738116057
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.:378.6795539439939
Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced.:459.6664221619763
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.:522.0629685372859
Collins moreover adds," "I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally known.:829.1508061245918
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them.:133.4293924278741
I am not qualified to form one.:569.9036558558505
Every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch.:328.7975024590057
"But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope every thing will be well."  "Is my father in town?"  "Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word."  "And have you heard from him often?"  "We have heard only once.:243.540860069371
An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure.:143.94030191056223
He drew a chair near her.:2458.0109781161727
It would have been strange if they had.:259.9658957824957
Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs.:411.80054881428714
With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.:286.5459158279678
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper.:667.0887521798793
Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr.:374.03720293142817
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.:401.4954429318228
Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said,--  "This walk is not wide enough for our party.:2791.7464237339013
Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare say Mr.:116.06139645390886
Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.:110.17008878241147
Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation.:824.9837871035976
If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on him.:104.82151892359144
Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.:1082.3094941754603
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first.:483.63509180104376
And I think you will agree with me,      in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both      on his account and my niece's.:602.1576580261138
Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before.:432.9678073745217
This room was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then.:430.51198342146284
"Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know myself what it is about."       "Gracechurch-street, Monday,       August 2.:248.6180572063683
You have withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for him.:182.71607624283047
Bennet could not give her consent, or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when Mr.:182.30698186343076
The moment of her release from him was ecstacy.:3432.161605872416
His sense of her inferiority--of its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.:1057.7670662092032
Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers.:1358.796883234731
Bennet, as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.:212.26241506981924
You may depend upon my seeking no further."  "Oh!:262.7979695564512
In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!:1414.0939130670379
"It is a long time, Mr.:40.03317145799837
Bennet, "looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way.--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead.--_I_ shall not be able to keep you--and so I warn you.--I have done with you from this very day.--I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word.:194.84359993259787
never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which      was repeated to Colonel F.:226.53241831857073
Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life."  This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.:167.62259054354908
has she any family?"  "She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property."  "Ah!" cried Mrs.:792.2844018116127
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it."  "What should not you mind?"  "I should not mind any thing at all."  "Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility."  "I never can be thankful, Mr.:150.45627936989055
They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.:161.84326065912305
Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.:439.0813886090647
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_.:162.10102254795802
All that is      required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her      equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your      children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,      moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your      life, one hundred pounds per annum.:405.90147528271564
But it must not, shall not be.:127.34042305451493
CHAPTER XXII.:23456.03652377785
You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends.:342.7719803684368
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out like his information.:1265.8391911574893
It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now."  The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.:437.57839994611055
So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to the will, the difference was great.:686.6537618591518
But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham.:608.707864777096
Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business."  "And do you impute it to either of those?"  "Yes; to the last.:156.29665984763005
Consider how important every moment is, in such a case."  "Let me write for you," said Jane, "if you dislike the trouble yourself."  "I dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done."  And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.:99.11259687078937
There are a few things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.:97.86628570819013
Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, "if that disagreeable Mr.:264.7221621016288
Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs.:75.96886507547433
She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again.:140.91279411052943
What is to become of us!:119.70047921810227
The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary.:2072.2196118708744
Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.:1088.8561431629828
I was never more annoyed!:972.6425264211214
I know my dear uncle and      aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have      still something more to ask of the former.:126.13142074285969
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay, as they had been at first.:84.87621865870571
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.:523.2288649632598
"You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be completely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire."  "Oh!:852.1270817076346
Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.:202.5366025082408
Of course, we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work.:128.15201781180775
For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.:253.36703658945765
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together.:515.7533241550527
The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence.:250.78737653415257
Gardiner could not but be deeply affected.:349.75744447071304
Hurst and Mr.:100.32550822593251
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true."  "Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger.:259.95747917364423
There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much.:451.6595719302409
The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs.:414.4314632614212
With _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others!:569.6562074575445
While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.:730.4322831827735
"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!"  "He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can.:225.4152524400246
But now several minutes elapsed, without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane, as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground.:558.0904536428591
dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.:693.6136308693059
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,--that I am frightened out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me, such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.:1032.011214223586
Such a disappointment!:3262.946236937226
As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was.:93.60795391469857
The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr.:1207.0522272006494
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater policy concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by every thing.:1647.5070719189966
Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.:584.0262276118192
Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?"  She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed.:735.4899722168537
This will never do."  "You need not distress yourself.:422.12550090434064
Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk.:719.8566668906248
He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy.:880.0019510624193
She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.:2993.813210827854
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting, that had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been.:176.7329094392861
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs.:1121.640489345133
But gracious me!:7465.966499573598
This was agreed to, and Mrs.:128.611660622017
good or bad?"  "What is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it."  Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.:257.35278203118696
Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.:254.165271199773
While Sir William was with them, Mr.:52.00023042471005
She knew not what to think, nor how to account for it.:92.30419060615068
Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make _their_ marriage at all more probable?:1019.5681069154659
"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal."  "I assure you, Madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice.:88.17852798151007
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it.:248.13035814415989
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.:148.76455323988833
CHAPTER XXIII.:23456.03652377785
I must confess myself      surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.:442.8990574202223
to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.:361.6065945379171
Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard.:1882.1664859339562
Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either of them."  The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual.:305.29085738996497
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation.:783.2934980305189
Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and      sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the      address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to      the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."  - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm      License.:154.88810319590345
And when the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five altogether; Mr.:1315.4641265866346
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable.:1281.3530268946608
They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas.:824.8910211344936
They must be a great loss to _your_ family."  In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone.:568.6480408474839
"He meant, I believe," replied Jane, "to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could be made out from them.:453.1437260485729
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks.:2473.461979821018
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.:1178.8145876689919
It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of every one.:809.3394993165667
"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs.:3946.345250799205
He was most highly esteemed by Mr.:633.8077091999579
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.:865.7718585405246
Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs.:640.1597512431094
At night she opened her heart to Jane.:1482.0591842696858
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.:329.13152741552
She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--Mr.:174.35384123337832
"Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather singular."  "Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards.:319.2702805015193
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.:660.1442131191014
Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.:687.9776768426982
"What does Mr.:715.9568126095036
Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?:449.3484734231995
On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.:561.3711980282542
Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described.:461.2659887250275
I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately.:110.87941849620346
"He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!:233.13170129143785
But I wonder how long you _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.:126.432228629861
But papa is so disagreeable."  "A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever."  "And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good," added Kitty.:358.69959962067827
I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together.:231.9136119387947
Regard for my sister's credit and feelings      prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr.:745.253378272647
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach.:850.0885109473998
Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned.:253.6056482926921
"Your examination of Mr.:244.3320777734965
_She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.:1288.8641657984806
Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do.:651.0669595579388
Darcy?--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing."  Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.:329.37007565800775
Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object.:344.2059166428795
Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.:164.41046749230233
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever.:365.77920174709396
I mend pens remarkably well."  "Thank you--but I always mend my own."  "How can you contrive to write so even?"  He was silent.:457.82475745879304
I do not deserve it.:516.4221972200867
Bennet coolly observed,  "From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country.:251.15684207542964
On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion.:312.49868537996855
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?:3193.954925204158
It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it.:166.39703552570552
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.:601.4880242405185
Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?:1106.900679982105
I can recal nothing worse.:1740.108524036837
We will go round the Park every day.:224.59139673311287
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.:152.85028295862645
But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."  From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr.:352.1167077371236
"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he.:506.1243535977355
Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,  "May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?"  Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs.:230.56380376949585
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did."  The idea of Mr.:129.77594127036633
But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane.:271.2771322231752
Professor Michael S.:6646.040351135902
But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's.:229.59329774190564
Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself seriously to work to find it out.--She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success.:244.522877631604
Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.:587.7074267005922
Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go.:522.5778627654267
When is your turn to come?:1269.6966037618436
Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family; Jane heard them with horror.:636.7373466075114
He has also _brotherly_ pride, which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers."  "What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?"  He shook his head.--"I wish I could call her amiable.:576.7150086857483
After a short pause, her companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with me.:126.70876657371993
"It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth.:102.90727230704954
I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.:508.0083715865095
Darcy bowed.:23456.03652377785
He immediately offered to fetch her others; all that his library afforded.:1181.586899605386
You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence which was no less his due than his desert.:1461.4655798919907
Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself.:843.7062894687599
She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.:416.9529490591374
There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard.:136.6622767164329
Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things I know are all chance in this world.:604.9195935651322
It was a large, well-proportioned room, handsomely fitted up.:374.5239076317014
I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children, produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.:346.46483540690747
To Mr.:234.56218187795906
Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.:311.1998607206245
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."  "But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.:495.89975220325545
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her.:1123.7571502194387
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear."  "For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.--What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr.:498.5009058616846
Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.:1500.1237099378793
The supposition did not pain her.:2209.4691069586106
You have a sweet room here, Mr.:481.0932268654684
And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing.:296.0224408335137
And when you have given _your_ ball," she added, "I shall insist on their giving one also.:343.23371625961727
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.:834.6959891611124
It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible."  "Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?"  "Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds.--We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."  "This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure," said he.:350.4684178346567
She felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity, could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.:480.4164795167352
And you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner."  Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.:702.3613050346307
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr.:325.58718711725396
Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.:276.2711963419098
I speak nothing but the truth.:783.1512317694647
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's.:231.26632664546742
Do not distress me by the idea.:470.6241033856975
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort.:474.22000060881595
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else Mr.:883.5840219686897
Bennet exceedingly.:2591.827899571195
Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity, are not worth a regret.:1038.564617575573
only think!:3765.232734200165
But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again."  His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.:273.9781724503199
We must not make him desperate."  The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.:293.76187276814255
Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come, when if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.:308.94751826804253
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.:706.0474385755061
_They_ will never be distressed for money.:659.4305192046899
Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr.:160.4489442623122
Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours.:277.50276004323575
The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion.:832.4345128426306
She asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly.--Lady Catherine then observed,  "Your father's estate is entailed on Mr.:300.02863101459343
He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.:383.3916890815238
They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open, and their visitor entered.:278.2880677892754
When this was done, she had a less active part to play.:929.2317894859738
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued the subject, by saying, "But tell me all and every thing about it, which I have not already heard.:333.7591497081279
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs.:1036.3628119377386
For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.:56.1928317693212
II.:23456.03652377785
The wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions, may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke."  "Certainly," replied Elizabeth--"there are such people, but I hope I am not one of _them_.:396.34435587229615
"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr.:251.55559186060717
I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on having him.:395.8667661457811
Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.:924.5026985046914
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make      the latter probable.--If it be so, if I have been misled by such      error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been      unreasonable.:429.921161725294
Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful.:124.13764128977989
I am so happy.:83.73402774742118
The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.:961.3094466537036
Much had been done, and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.:619.4101699366682
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs.:338.7818969945243
What congratulations will then flow in!:12480.98317008616
She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if they could be of use to us."  "She had better have stayed at home," cried Elizabeth; "perhaps she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours.:200.42105211333856
She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.:156.2762124981769
Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.:185.91338121400872
I need not explain myself farther; and      though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she      feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so      deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may      feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable.:595.5964605709216
dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain.:700.7391228429269
The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation.:633.6984230876587
Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which astonished her husband and daughters.:162.5954141231311
My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made."  "Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine, what is to befall her?"  "I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth.:451.5484074638988
I shall see her in January.:794.4621183374437
Dear, dear Lizzy.:81.51370255244655
Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr.:187.9375299731034
But why Mr.:1131.8085641329603
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them.:440.29737742976005
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.:430.4082372754922
Heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking?:2121.720875463407
I know not what to think.:65.75093091165617
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr.:161.28943298152424
"I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left so small a collection of books.--What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr.:258.0742573284693
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness."  And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.:325.0060437872024
Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out,  "Oh, Papa, what news?:183.05779011135397
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all.:197.26530949241328
Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your confidante."     CHAPTER XIII.:266.78093544745565
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.:512.3249228057289
I want to talk very seriously.:2636.250569570876
Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.:274.79053754996016
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.--"I assure you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do.:288.622691579633
No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room.:321.40867480145266
She is not such a simpleton.:527.9184943918825
My youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown herself into the power of--of Mr.:780.7816428595734
She shared in their attendance on Mrs.:1128.361143895029
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.:1859.5174900165775
Her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.:187.78786388655652
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this.:899.9584650908434
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene.:344.7723698332475
If he no longer cares for me, why silent?:1501.0064732844887
Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.:553.4654364292861
Nobody wants him to come.:241.17471552588447
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice."  "_You_ observed it, Mr.:2362.9173479366455
Good Heaven!:1542.1220866707727
Darcy in a most infamous manner.:822.8777480675471
we talked and laughed so loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!"  To this, Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures.:925.6755269817057
Hurst looked at her with astonishment.:115.16762601004012
Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.:738.5720886219804
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs.:348.0305846739102
It was in the Times and the Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be.:228.94735772992885
The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.:579.243451612666
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.:1338.178498652284
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible.:557.836964742975
She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said,  "By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield?--I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure."  "If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards."  "I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.:315.2218422275006
Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs.:663.830025907748
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited.:230.94005319642486
CHAPTER XV.:23456.03652377785
Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.:841.0765083655879
His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.:355.2669473539773
no, no, this is not likely.:210.44106200256155
One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it."  "I never thought Mr.:193.83374647905245
Where shall you change horses?--Oh!:5007.936654705185
is she handsome?"  "She is a most charming young lady indeed.:389.3261581225636
Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure."  She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library,  "Oh!:94.42397335277532
In as short a time as Mr.:1309.186484708379
LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees.:101.42633224777634
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement.:305.4772666109666
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr.:970.7194031392313
Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter.:219.11322498772523
These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.:1696.4983778688647
