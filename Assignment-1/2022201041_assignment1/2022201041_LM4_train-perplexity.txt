a yellow dressinggown , ungirdled , was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air . : 14.1725207331827
he held the bowl aloft and intoned : — _introibo ad altare dei_ . : 11.401986275905871
halted , he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely : — come up , kinch ! : 19.338314732696375
come up , you fearful jesuit ! : 37.04512522725868
solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest . : 13.373586376520297
he faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower , the surrounding land and the awaking mountains . : 13.87181117894503
then , catching sight of stephen dedalus , he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air , gurgling in his throat and shaking his head . : 14.0817764334793
stephen dedalus , displeased and sleepy , leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him , equine in its length , and at the light untonsured hair , grained and hued like pale oak . : 10.098189083391452
buck mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly . : 15.013450459180639
— back to barracks ! : 69.80584180956757
he said sternly . : 79.29356524521752
he added in a preacher ’ s tone : — for this , o dearly beloved , is the genuine christine : body and soul and blood and ouns . : 14.00339488615285
slow music , please . : 32.71194288942601
shut your eyes , gents . : 28.293577408430423
one moment . : 85.78934186625168
a little trouble about those white corpuscles . : 21.775035171380065
silence , all . : 53.33317769209456
he peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call , then paused awhile in rapt attention , his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points . : 10.953522024748143
chrysostomos . : 67.94492493637387
two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm . : 17.97056374528426
switch off the current , will you ? : 15.911525260020081
he skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher , gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown . : 12.61987863777057
the plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate , patron of arts in the middle ages . : 9.14788059164826
a pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips . : 20.1874996001967
— the mockery of it ! : 40.435102904845444
he said gaily . : 79.5172407883857
your absurd name , an ancient greek ! : 32.07411265101417
he pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet , laughing to himself . : 14.93695106703943
stephen dedalus stepped up , followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest , watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet , dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck . : 10.133548393927006
buck mulligan ’ s gay voice went on . : 19.743221290615235
— my name is absurd too : malachi mulligan , two dactyls . : 21.18131997808925
but it has a hellenic ring , hasn ’ t it ? : 15.917514774024996
tripping and sunny like the buck himself . : 14.461235150918979
will you come if i can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid ? : 12.930945382165822
he laid the brush aside and , laughing with delight , cried : — will he come ? : 21.286704486968773
the jejune jesuit ! : 82.56169426056873
ceasing , he began to shave with care . : 17.22906289238494
— yes , my love ? : 56.1150258444409
— god , isn ’ t he dreadful ? : 28.934156174701712
he said frankly . : 78.94955331196074
a ponderous saxon . : 79.29389905824247
he thinks you ’ re not a gentleman . : 32.328482780483974
god , these bloody english ! : 24.5401698560823
bursting with money and indigestion . : 13.6619183914866
because he comes from oxford . : 30.05056062174777
you know , dedalus , you have the real oxford manner . : 27.056519584669765
he can ’ t make you out . : 37.91261273539799
o , my name for you is the best : kinch , the knife - blade . : 25.11517671145702
he shaved warily over his chin . : 32.938622076825844
— he was raving all night about a black panther , stephen said . : 18.179414774883483
where is his guncase ? : 41.991576618972516
— a woful lunatic ! : 38.826709885150755
mulligan said . : 41.30027244737738
were you in a funk ? : 57.37483962910069
— i was , stephen said with energy and growing fear . : 18.90533190749316
out here in the dark with a man i don ’ t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther . : 13.301045437516642
you saved men from drowning . : 30.298741867835624
i ’ m not a hero , however . : 22.057328664370694
if he stays on here i am off . : 19.791806813607142
buck mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade . : 22.1006461629895
he hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily . : 12.20493306136969
— scutter ! : 145.7480845640197
he cried thickly . : 78.67981810823552
stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief . : 14.260133624087473
buck mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly . : 12.721109956875388
then , gazing over the handkerchief , he said : — the bard ’ s noserag ! : 22.211978581247596
a new art colour for our irish poets : snotgreen . : 14.061469126690252
you can almost taste it , can ’ t you ? : 23.53970075317865
he mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over dublin bay , his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly . : 14.756209099336766
— god ! : 137.50246925644626
he said quietly . : 74.53354830328756
isn ’ t the sea what algy calls it : a great sweet mother ? : 15.595770668143528
the snotgreen sea . : 89.39281819615628
the scrotumtightening sea . : 83.57521802935608
_epi oinopa ponton_ . : 15.212555278558122
ah , dedalus , the greeks ! : 53.32303194729134
i must teach you . : 46.54401065392909
_thalatta ! : 53.92878406661024
thalatta ! _ she is our great sweet mother . : 17.490416159024257
come and look . : 65.43124386238253
stephen stood up and went over to the parapet . : 30.271832779399286
leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of kingstown . : 14.376870483209732
— our mighty mother ! : 47.78865494965038
he turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to stephen ’ s face . : 17.55049727406057
— the aunt thinks you killed your mother , he said . : 15.51661257407316
that ’ s why she won ’ t let me have anything to do with you . : 17.41183553013093
— someone killed her , stephen said gloomily . : 34.152551703200345
— you could have knelt down , damn it , kinch , when your dying mother asked you , buck mulligan said . : 16.077702954104385
i ’ m hyperborean as much as you . : 20.406100957544098
but to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her . : 14.972483150598517
and you refused . : 85.1318972292032
there is something sinister in you .... : 24.643257587136063
he broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek . : 13.128739093867038
a tolerant smile curled his lips . : 22.266872673157078
— but a lovely mummer ! : 52.805965765621295
he murmured to himself . : 57.0878878535805
kinch , the loveliest mummer of them all ! : 23.325254442011225
he shaved evenly and with care , in silence , seriously . : 25.26653961893236
stephen , an elbow rested on the jagged granite , leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat - sleeve . : 10.571639078647852
pain , that was not yet the pain of love , fretted his heart . : 14.854933935406596
silently , in a dream she had come to him after her death , her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood , her breath , that had bent upon him , mute , reproachful , a faint odour of wetted ashes . : 9.68547502319282
across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him . : 10.818381533701316
the ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid . : 12.45480032290903
a bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting . : 7.8333853482152485
— ah , poor dogsbody ! : 40.2663242222324
he said in a kind voice . : 52.659619357999844
i must give you a shirt and a few noserags . : 32.13209972069347
how are the secondhand breeks ? : 26.92826961934684
— they fit well enough , stephen answered . : 22.962708938360347
buck mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip . : 11.69892882725187
— the mockery of it , he said contentedly . : 28.158320427168718
secondleg they should be . : 18.735497886763554
god knows what poxy bowsy left them off . : 12.6088029306518
i have a lovely pair with a hair stripe , grey . : 21.5623183305455
you ’ ll look spiffing in them . : 21.000129993485242
i ’ m not joking , kinch . : 17.633063363201266
you look damn well when you ’ re dressed . : 24.336156258227636
— thanks , stephen said . : 34.06460162865327
i can ’ t wear them if they are grey . : 22.540175041080417
— he can ’ t wear them , buck mulligan told his face in the mirror . : 22.91760325916393
etiquette is etiquette . : 20.663629368638063
he kills his mother but he can ’ t wear grey trousers . : 21.88329050128216
he folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin . : 9.54254932034108
stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes . : 18.03194848719025
— that fellow i was with in the ship last night , said buck mulligan , says you have g . : 30.472745309762015
p . : 60.37544602765737
i . : 197.2361863427551
general paralysis of the insane ! : 41.01868741045464
he swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea . : 11.717805397194152
his curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth . : 18.89596556762147
laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk . : 13.347634210774991
— look at yourself , he said , you dreadful bard ! : 25.32542495866097
stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him , cleft by a crooked crack . : 19.95544404066741
hair on end . : 47.545464696195005
as he and others see me . : 35.54957104499567
who chose this face for me ? : 24.61007743218309
this dogsbody to rid of vermin . : 18.73383353984444
it asks me too . : 50.020028384658524
— i pinched it out of the skivvy ’ s room , buck mulligan said . : 17.909295103385
it does her all right . : 35.1908666677595
the aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for malachi . : 14.632238247074836
lead him not into temptation . : 16.48041235718973
and her name is ursula . : 56.14486474260249
laughing again , he brought the mirror away from stephen ’ s peering eyes . : 23.86299567991554
— the rage of caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror , he said . : 13.238457936913921
if wilde were only alive to see you ! : 21.54528005022449
drawing back and pointing , stephen said with bitterness : — it is a symbol of irish art . : 14.248209733815125
the cracked lookingglass of a servant . : 40.56067093768458
buck mulligan suddenly linked his arm in stephen ’ s and walked with him round the tower , his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them . : 13.76262340169956
— it ’ s not fair to tease you like that , kinch , is it ? : 17.86100113465088
he said kindly . : 68.0484831759394
god knows you have more spirit than any of them . : 18.27667755709142
parried again . : 24.060995154386408
he fears the lancet of my art as i fear that of his . : 20.75610341287341
the cold steel pen . : 56.8963055330486
— cracked lookingglass of a servant ! : 38.55457622878483
tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea . : 16.472786735025522
he ’ s stinking with money and thinks you ’ re not a gentleman . : 16.84267454308262
his old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to zulus or some bloody swindle or other . : 9.028036632544246
god , kinch , if you and i could only work together we might do something for the island . : 18.333866758139497
hellenise it . : 24.598020317391114
cranly ’ s arm . : 32.24326546435109
his arm . : 112.9899648578429
— and to think of your having to beg from these swine . : 19.038564647728883
i ’ m the only one that knows what you are . : 25.254438994487145
why don ’ t you trust me more ? : 20.08287833424518
what have you up your nose against me ? : 24.444817869860525
is it haines ? : 66.67405669958285
palefaces : they hold their ribs with laughter , one clasping another . : 9.42093786114463
o , i shall expire ! : 42.03144466535333
break the news to her gently , aubrey ! : 16.387085077108672
i shall die ! : 75.42401075183496
with slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table , with trousers down at heels , chased by ades of magdalen with the tailor ’ s shears . : 11.7719097634493
a scared calf ’ s face gilded with marmalade . : 21.309175157994968
i don ’ t want to be debagged ! : 24.446673688416407
don ’ t you play the giddy ox with me ! : 12.348732060477758
shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle . : 19.939902229497456
a deaf gardener , aproned , masked with matthew arnold ’ s face , pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms . : 6.992924202718789
to ourselves ... : 194.58930647166125
omphalos . : 53.92878406661024
— let him stay , stephen said . : 23.032108917757082
there ’ s nothing wrong with him except at night . : 20.099557948436416
— then what is it ? : 39.22588730133701
buck mulligan asked impatiently . : 22.387168540357575
cough it up . : 26.288172542717817
i ’ m quite frank with you . : 18.309518801159605
what have you against me now ? : 36.54613569408894
they halted , looking towards the blunt cape of bray head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale . : 14.426634601300503
stephen freed his arm quietly . : 32.1023492772766
— do you wish me to tell you ? : 39.01782405019574
he asked . : 88.42169198976627
— yes , what is it ? : 32.07399682400339
buck mulligan answered . : 28.169267240332324
i don ’ t remember anything . : 23.178980061901047
he looked in stephen ’ s face as he spoke . : 31.542364247690106
a light wind passed his brow , fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes . : 8.570305543303975
stephen , depressed by his own voice , said : — do you remember the first day i went to your house after my mother ’ s death ? : 17.981989913463856
buck mulligan frowned quickly and said : — what ? : 19.19321009025052
i can ’ t remember anything . : 27.38536486443908
i remember only ideas and sensations . : 21.776371268297773
what happened in the name of god ? : 48.13308624949336
— you were making tea , stephen said , and went across the landing to get more hot water . : 18.79590157775585
your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom . : 23.68362569992201
she asked you who was in your room . : 40.626666472275325
— yes ? : 131.90076195766017
i forget . : 158.3667944107248
— you said , stephen answered , _o , it ’ s only dedalus whose mother is beastly dead . _ a flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to buck mulligan ’ s cheek . : 11.275072001754504
well ? : 173.54148171770441
what harm is that ? : 44.52760806020278
— and what is death , he asked , your mother ’ s or yours or my own ? : 25.037364679043936
you saw only your mother die . : 29.20834216147598
i see them pop off every day in the mater and richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom . : 13.343195963194558
it ’ s a beastly thing and nothing else . : 19.027534812308097
it simply doesn ’ t matter . : 38.68651345970704
you wouldn ’ t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you . : 20.19664589373665
because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you , only it ’ s injected the wrong way . : 15.852602884938047
to me it ’ s all a mockery and beastly . : 22.203158344928905
her cerebral lobes are not functioning . : 25.63778910745684
she calls the doctor sir peter teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt . : 10.7251686927042
humour her till it ’ s over . : 21.176396936088256
you crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because i don ’ t whinge like some hired mute from lalouette ’ s . : 8.935893043408784
absurd ! : 107.84551075099675
i suppose i did say it . : 36.797099772775525
i didn ’ t mean to offend the memory of your mother . : 16.029241048112837
he had spoken himself into boldness . : 22.144249628468053
stephen , shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart , said very coldly : — i am not thinking of the offence to my mother . : 15.861021979119021
— of what then ? : 67.54743197431533
buck mulligan asked . : 29.33580794355398
— of the offence to me , stephen answered . : 42.54239157179232
buck mulligan swung round on his heel . : 21.58921251721369
— o , an impossible person ! : 36.35134968231812
he exclaimed . : 172.29973222650537
he walked off quickly round the parapet . : 28.691254829573094
stephen stood at his post , gazing over the calm sea towards the headland . : 17.41069719181667
sea and headland now grew dim . : 13.376284400574749
pulses were beating in his eyes , veiling their sight , and he felt the fever of his cheeks . : 13.377925399747408
a voice within the tower called loudly : — are you up there , mulligan ? : 24.96342139701897
— i ’ m coming , buck mulligan answered . : 18.404783940051733
he turned towards stephen and said : — look at the sea . : 26.04920903961263
what does it care about offences ? : 25.401329591003105
chuck loyola , kinch , and come on down . : 20.547070997194457
the sassenach wants his morning rashers . : 22.55391427620866
his head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase , level with the roof : — don ’ t mope over it all day , he said . : 17.28505260320515
i ’ m inconsequent . : 38.97227477351771
give up the moody brooding . : 32.97197585044016
his head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead : and no more turn aside and brood upon love ’ s bitter mystery for fergus rules the brazen cars . : 9.81988838153175
woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed . : 12.106058866845077
inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened , spurned by lightshod hurrying feet . : 7.2542937991774945
the twining stresses , two by two . : 26.881525986286448
a hand plucking the harpstrings , merging their twining chords . : 9.637256610417666
wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide . : 10.97065700317978
a cloud began to cover the sun slowly , wholly , shadowing the bay in deeper green . : 10.334923237419751
it lay beneath him , a bowl of bitter waters . : 26.0489207375855
fergus ’ song : i sang it alone in the house , holding down the long dark chords . : 14.252712563317411
her door was open : she wanted to hear my music . : 22.042116728533383
silent with awe and pity i went to her bedside . : 17.18947164417456
for those words , stephen : love ’ s bitter mystery . : 29.26871735646943
where now ? : 103.78865539669464
her secrets : old featherfans , tasselled dancecards , powdered with musk , a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer . : 6.835445091988868
a birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl . : 24.30804273477189
she heard old royce sing in the pantomime of turko the terrible and laughed with others when he sang : i am the boy that can enjoy invisibility . : 10.051446970243143
phantasmal mirth , folded away : muskperfumed . : 7.807052191669371
and no more turn aside and brood . : 22.765413076471923
folded away in the memory of nature with her toys . : 23.033036243167516
memories beset his brooding brain . : 10.321128843868529
her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament . : 21.806936719373127
a cored apple , filled with brown sugar , roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening . : 13.535210258891883
her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children ’ s shirts . : 19.601572268003615
in a dream , silently , she had come to him , her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood , her breath , bent over him with mute secret words , a faint odour of wetted ashes . : 9.444033589442778
her glazing eyes , staring out of death , to shake and bend my soul . : 20.473258211664184
on me alone . : 80.932741882279
the ghostcandle to light her agony . : 25.543063028784463
ghostly light on the tortured face . : 18.46043324038952
her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror , while all prayed on their knees . : 10.944018967091624
her eyes on me to strike me down . : 35.3269166419959
_liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet : iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat . _ ghoul ! : 5.705005227429072
chewer of corpses ! : 15.252095373475433
no , mother ! : 81.32471226539695
let me be and let me live . : 25.716159068790027
— kinch ahoy ! : 64.62219577327416
buck mulligan ’ s voice sang from within the tower . : 15.852106847569871
it came nearer up the staircase , calling again . : 22.303463027488213
stephen , still trembling at his soul ’ s cry , heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words . : 15.118831384331669
— dedalus , come down , like a good mosey . : 43.07769881150076
breakfast is ready . : 27.523865754225078
haines is apologising for waking us last night . : 9.598876541473091
— i ’ m coming , stephen said , turning . : 20.591310354135025
— do , for jesus ’ sake , buck mulligan said . : 17.898949825754215
for my sake and for all our sakes . : 25.84760907896565
his head disappeared and reappeared . : 27.23386329230984
— i told him your symbol of irish art . : 18.216650202241393
he says it ’ s very clever . : 36.808940289712
touch him for a quid , will you ? : 20.20731649840988
— i get paid this morning , stephen said . : 20.333743084683395
— the school kip ? : 44.73202992164374
how much ? : 75.42947707622598
four quid ? : 63.21937332100928
lend us one . : 27.58722934359031
— if you want it , stephen said . : 32.52060490764153
— four shining sovereigns , buck mulligan cried with delight . : 13.91290587786844
we ’ ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids . : 10.302823401255203
four omnipotent sovereigns . : 33.77054961509177
he flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs , singing out of tune with a cockney accent : o , won ’ t we have a merry time , drinking whisky , beer and wine ! : 10.784303710406412
on coronation , coronation day ! : 26.53534397403275
o , won ’ t we have a merry time on coronation day ! : 13.53886283984855
warm sunshine merrying over the sea . : 19.863824501108873
the nickel shavingbowl shone , forgotten , on the parapet . : 20.406618095498857
why should i bring it down ? : 27.082621672246
or leave it there all day , forgotten friendship ? : 26.38781000208184
so i carried the boat of incense then at clongowes . : 14.320003774966036
i am another now and yet the same . : 27.713347561199512
a servant too . : 81.63267466570139
a server of a servant . : 63.48223953233684
in the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower buck mulligan ’ s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth , hiding and revealing its yellow glow . : 9.717928525084071
two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans : and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated , turning . : 8.801912611771936
— we ’ ll be choked , buck mulligan said . : 14.094329691374186
haines , open that door , will you ? : 16.653377655678224
stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker . : 29.016687780369207
a tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting , went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors . : 16.11926257661324
— have you the key ? : 46.70880636939413
a voice asked . : 79.38118637481101
— dedalus has it , buck mulligan said . : 24.87489468673103
janey mack , i ’ m choked ! : 14.207025110295165
he howled , without looking up from the fire : — kinch ! : 30.068310317814422
— it ’ s in the lock , stephen said , coming forward . : 23.98370636204473
haines stood at the doorway , looking out . : 28.26009319949855
stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait . : 14.521994560125519
buck mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him . : 15.40704604685327
then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table , set them down heavily and sighed with relief . : 11.669841288981267
— i ’ m melting , he said , as the candle remarked when ... : 17.036893463952406
but , hush ! : 56.305284535110644
not a word more on that subject ! : 29.754025334381478
kinch , wake up ! : 22.3864410352555
bread , butter , honey . : 22.601954660482548
haines , come in . : 38.4915296457977
the grub is ready . : 48.81739758736089
bless us , o lord , and these thy gifts . : 24.380577034896817
where ’ s the sugar ? : 42.622513278967794
o , jay , there ’ s no milk . : 20.319415462940576
stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker . : 20.961759361018547
buck mulligan sat down in a sudden pet . : 23.9505726252782
— what sort of a kip is this ? : 30.871846672537675
i told her to come after eight . : 32.07605163858796
— we can drink it black , stephen said thirstily . : 20.141752302722725
there ’ s a lemon in the locker . : 31.90941985791363
— o , damn you and your paris fads ! : 20.757622686737953
i want sandycove milk . : 41.164536597878566
haines came in from the doorway and said quietly : — that woman is coming up with the milk . : 26.01285537420701
— the blessings of god on you ! : 31.63923476880674
buck mulligan cried , jumping up from his chair . : 18.97357388814042
sit down . : 47.282247337869926
pour out the tea there . : 23.62159842085043
the sugar is in the bag . : 72.14239277088376
here , i can ’ t go fumbling at the damned eggs . : 21.22348565439753
he hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates , saying : — _in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti . _ haines sat down to pour out the tea . : 9.814847482053178
but , i say , mulligan , you do make strong tea , don ’ t you ? : 20.799259227713094
buck mulligan , hewing thick slices from the loaf , said in an old woman ’ s wheedling voice : — when i makes tea i makes tea , as old mother grogan said . : 14.188771769693535
and when i makes water i makes water . : 23.281676797383557
— by jove , it is tea , haines said . : 23.865075613058078
buck mulligan went on hewing and wheedling : — _so i do , mrs cahill , _ says she . : 11.771445427649866
_begob , ma ’ am , _ says mrs cahill , _god send you don ’ t make them in the one pot . _ he lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread , impaled on his knife . : 8.353882753462278
— that ’ s folk , he said very earnestly , for your book , haines . : 21.47398299119508
five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of dundrum . : 10.796856648989314
printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind . : 25.934882829968995
he turned to stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice , lifting his brows : — can you recall , brother , is mother grogan ’ s tea and water pot spoken of in the mabinogion or is it in the upanishads ? : 14.576384997607386
— i doubt it , said stephen gravely . : 34.848212877215744
— do you now ? : 57.53860313928676
buck mulligan said in the same tone . : 30.251338382523112
your reasons , pray ? : 48.641725893096805
— i fancy , stephen said as he ate , it did not exist in or out of the mabinogion . : 20.271961117852566
mother grogan was , one imagines , a kinswoman of mary ann . : 18.83130145912279
buck mulligan ’ s face smiled with delight . : 17.380046424922632
— charming ! : 163.42201154454125
he said in a finical sweet voice , showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly . : 15.352032929015442
do you think she was ? : 45.047084635311336
quite charming ! : 73.11440047466581
then , suddenly overclouding all his features , he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf : _ — for old mary ann she doesn ’ t care a damn . : 12.086826601593582
but , hising up her petticoats ... _ he crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned . : 9.98982161270352
the doorway was darkened by an entering form . : 20.4039545406392
— the milk , sir ! : 63.94761668514262
— come in , ma ’ am , mulligan said . : 18.776743171130786
kinch , get the jug . : 31.85982455621484
an old woman came forward and stood by stephen ’ s elbow . : 22.87687943048232
— that ’ s a lovely morning , sir , she said . : 18.43651957912899
glory be to god . : 23.567243305017456
— to whom ? : 102.61295050984216
mulligan said , glancing at her . : 30.689673165378686
ah , to be sure ! : 50.45070075077308
stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker . : 24.053088762178692
— the islanders , mulligan said to haines casually , speak frequently of the collector of prepuces . : 12.703678625727257
— how much , sir ? : 51.016586573328865
asked the old woman . : 49.3160544741992
— a quart , stephen said . : 26.50806629466421
he watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk , not hers . : 13.99764103342456
old shrunken paps . : 48.912782866974574
she poured again a measureful and a tilly . : 20.709768143454852
old and secret she had entered from a morning world , maybe a messenger . : 14.269339933207041
she praised the goodness of the milk , pouring it out . : 23.41931633629274
crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field , a witch on her toadstool , her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs . : 11.411260517601162
they lowed about her whom they knew , dewsilky cattle . : 14.813014296433185
silk of the kine and poor old woman , names given her in old times . : 15.776972778061216
a wandering crone , lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer , their common cuckquean , a messenger from the secret morning . : 11.00511396705999
to serve or to upbraid , whether he could not tell : but scorned to beg her favour . : 11.537001843421578
— it is indeed , ma ’ am , buck mulligan said , pouring milk into their cups . : 13.342006397293762
— taste it , sir , she said . : 31.876760085330588
he drank at her bidding . : 46.35291582322863
— if we could live on good food like that , he said to her somewhat loudly , we wouldn ’ t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts . : 13.649198770954778
living in a bogswamp , eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust , horsedung and consumptives ’ spits . : 7.61740261196081
— are you a medical student , sir ? : 25.70441760858103
the old woman asked . : 60.241343330495425
— i am , ma ’ am , buck mulligan answered . : 14.636851666181668
stephen listened in scornful silence . : 22.40821570644276
she bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly , her bonesetter , her medicineman : me she slights . : 14.168447257843644
to the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman ’ s unclean loins , of man ’ s flesh made not in god ’ s likeness , the serpent ’ s prey . : 18.10931888167045
and to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes . : 13.621471753194879
— do you understand what he says ? : 44.017980492549285
stephen asked her . : 62.911680170585
— is it french you are talking , sir ? : 25.201914477882294
the old woman said to haines . : 39.8474906876706
haines spoke to her again a longer speech , confidently . : 16.77313509214712
— irish , buck mulligan said . : 29.829176805627604
is there gaelic on you ? : 35.720525418509354
— i thought it was irish , she said , by the sound of it . : 27.27126438159871
are you from the west , sir ? : 37.237277630137534
— i am an englishman , haines answered . : 23.72993700853196
— he ’ s english , buck mulligan said , and he thinks we ought to speak irish in ireland . : 16.49106681264242
— sure we ought to , the old woman said , and i ’ m ashamed i don ’ t speak the language myself . : 18.007357277732336
i ’ m told it ’ s a grand language by them that knows . : 16.45731885098679
— grand is no name for it , said buck mulligan . : 33.53710288905395
wonderful entirely . : 51.08958106857383
fill us out some more tea , kinch . : 14.566767589195313
would you like a cup , ma ’ am ? : 21.406908666880717
— no , thank you , sir , the old woman said , slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go . : 16.709229746997682
haines said to her : — have you your bill ? : 31.214009873518787
we had better pay her , mulligan , hadn ’ t we ? : 18.697323168167376
stephen filled again the three cups . : 29.591161133041243
— bill , sir ? : 51.93713886504066
she said , halting . : 54.244363001828525
well , it ’ s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling . : 7.7465506370728905
that ’ s a shilling and one and two is two and two , sir . : 19.444894204865328
buck mulligan sighed and , having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides , stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets . : 8.911917733492054
— pay up and look pleasant , haines said to him , smiling . : 22.27565054219138
stephen filled a third cup , a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk . : 11.75944331420379
buck mulligan brought up a florin , twisted it round in his fingers and cried : — a miracle ! : 14.731971468191999
he passed it along the table towards the old woman , saying : — ask nothing more of me , sweet . : 21.65467945889607
all i can give you i give . : 35.77799428747254
stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand . : 22.088219163030438
— we ’ ll owe twopence , he said . : 17.51089848614744
— time enough , sir , she said , taking the coin . : 24.810283575951473
good morning , sir . : 27.73138373224867
she curtseyed and went out , followed by buck mulligan ’ s tender chant : _ — heart of my heart , were it more , more would be laid at your feet . _ he turned to stephen and said : — seriously , dedalus . : 15.854495162847282
i ’ m stony . : 40.150378278990964
hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money . : 10.815407487169713
today the bards must drink and junket . : 12.869877689818152
ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty . : 13.6812451342163
— that reminds me , haines said , rising , that i have to visit your national library today . : 18.99611473444791
— our swim first , buck mulligan said . : 19.027201891562903
he turned to stephen and asked blandly : — is this the day for your monthly wash , kinch ? : 16.435282098952975
then he said to haines : — the unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month . : 14.248256191702698
— all ireland is washed by the gulfstream , stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf . : 16.054239575674845
haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke : — i intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me . : 13.498776650742936
speaking to me . : 28.87440225302406
they wash and tub and scrub . : 20.85279812992169
agenbite of inwit . : 17.021587632227607
conscience . : 77.7762809998722
yet here ’ s a spot . : 31.43484415478855
— that one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of irish art is deuced good . : 13.15063836867875
buck mulligan kicked stephen ’ s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone : — wait till you hear him on hamlet , haines . : 15.124254995680987
— well , i mean it , haines said , still speaking to stephen . : 26.683484903148745
i was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in . : 20.86074107896289
stephen asked . : 69.7305611174944
haines laughed and , as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock , said : — i don ’ t know , i ’ m sure . : 15.509650786908056
he strolled out to the doorway . : 55.72680424824611
buck mulligan bent across to stephen and said with coarse vigour : — you put your hoof in it now . : 12.40388408898328
what did you say that for ? : 46.210302565215535
— well ? : 150.0187332369146
stephen said . : 42.703151839048274
the problem is to get money . : 62.33203800949968
from whom ? : 136.17364082882736
from the milkwoman or from him . : 22.893050227696204
it ’ s a toss up , i think . : 24.526623023040816
— i blow him out about you , buck mulligan said , and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes . : 13.053147871203981
— i see little hope , stephen said , from her or from him . : 21.62083536198139
buck mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on stephen ’ s arm . : 14.205323476561533
— from me , kinch , he said . : 33.53978468782817
damn all else they are good for . : 22.403475974593974
why don ’ t you play them as i do ? : 22.31485302257807
to hell with them all . : 47.93812651776039
let us get out of the kip . : 31.534348117080672
he stood up , gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown , saying resignedly : — mulligan is stripped of his garments . : 13.464196565156424
he emptied his pockets on to the table . : 27.711753612221337
— there ’ s your snotrag , he said . : 18.15383380304513
his hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief . : 16.69626393880777
god , we ’ ll simply have to dress the character . : 17.169712021515178
i want puce gloves and green boots . : 22.1930220594161
contradiction . : 67.94492493637387
do i contradict myself ? : 32.60940593910717
very well then , i contradict myself . : 33.76004129159696
mercurial malachi . : 28.984175722573195
a limp black missile flew out of his talking hands . : 19.91808229265417
— and there ’ s your latin quarter hat , he said . : 19.336519133818143
stephen picked it up and put it on . : 35.08978801548744
haines called to them from the doorway : — are you coming , you fellows ? : 27.287378568114626
— i ’ m ready , buck mulligan answered , going towards the door . : 16.65061492684526
come out , kinch . : 56.7110348723251
you have eaten all we left , i suppose . : 23.980850012884538
resigned he passed out with grave words and gait , saying , wellnigh with sorrow : — and going forth he met butterly . : 8.361671109874814
stephen , taking his ashplant from its leaningplace , followed them out and , as they went down the ladder , pulled to the slow iron door and locked it . : 13.701767648615986
he put the huge key in his inner pocket . : 28.648524931454528
at the foot of the ladder buck mulligan asked : — did you bring the key ? : 19.655302198912274
— i have it , stephen said , preceding them . : 25.81729723263107
he walked on . : 68.49897244659725
behind him he heard buck mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses . : 10.912674708165136
— down , sir ! : 108.78586986218836
how dare you , sir ! : 40.285703804492336
haines asked : — do you pay rent for this tower ? : 19.053510400510827
— twelve quid , buck mulligan said . : 18.919702044218848
— to the secretary of state for war , stephen added over his shoulder . : 17.859639874638564
they halted while haines surveyed the tower and said at last : — rather bleak in wintertime , i should say . : 12.038485545627287
martello you call it ? : 20.258260924632644
— billy pitt had them built , buck mulligan said , when the french were on the sea . : 14.214429732370897
but ours is the _omphalos_ . : 42.62453495829246
— what is your idea of hamlet ? : 26.61338475198557
haines asked stephen . : 35.80834119885837
— no , no , buck mulligan shouted in pain . : 20.872362899494856
i ’ m not equal to thomas aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up . : 11.980785799063865
wait till i have a few pints in me first . : 20.616873277724
he turned to stephen , saying , as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat : — you couldn ’ t manage it under three pints , kinch , could you ? : 13.013035378657335
— it has waited so long , stephen said listlessly , it can wait longer . : 17.242882399035203
— you pique my curiosity , haines said amiably . : 14.956927018065198
is it some paradox ? : 42.99657069539706
— pooh ! : 151.4744188087022
we have grown out of wilde and paradoxes . : 20.98424377997769
it ’ s quite simple . : 37.0148521230313
he proves by algebra that hamlet ’ s grandson is shakespeare ’ s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father . : 15.849624517654055
haines said , beginning to point at stephen . : 22.62727620930916
he himself ? : 193.63281321268622
buck mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and , bending in loose laughter , said to stephen ’ s ear : — o , shade of kinch the elder ! : 10.789572072227458
japhet in search of a father ! : 22.03378920832981
— we ’ re always tired in the morning , stephen said to haines . : 20.975621283032886
and it is rather long to tell . : 41.502947801039696
buck mulligan , walking forward again , raised his hands . : 18.41575886872478
— the sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of dedalus , he said . : 10.279544964154681
— i mean to say , haines explained to stephen as they followed , this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of elsinore . : 12.685013493753038
_that beetles o ’ er his base into the sea , _ isn ’ t it ? : 12.665454763841007
buck mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards stephen but did not speak . : 12.212782039924308
in the bright silent instant stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires . : 9.84834816709931
— it ’ s a wonderful tale , haines said , bringing them to halt again . : 15.067639508164849
eyes , pale as the sea the wind had freshened , paler , firm and prudent . : 10.441392654833608
the seas ’ ruler , he gazed southward over the bay , empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the muglins . : 16.163546415953476
— i read a theological interpretation of it somewhere , he said bemused . : 19.574790190046105
the father and the son idea . : 71.84520841952339
the son striving to be atoned with the father . : 35.37620654079373
buck mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face . : 14.122308149680695
he looked at them , his wellshaped mouth open happily , his eyes , from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense , blinking with mad gaiety . : 11.173462045506925
he moved a doll ’ s head to and fro , the brims of his panama hat quivering , and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice : _ — i ’ m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard . : 12.950342437250068
my mother ’ s a jew , my father ’ s a bird . : 26.69261890604688
with joseph the joiner i cannot agree . : 18.576236618070958
so here ’ s to disciples and calvary . _ he held up a forefinger of warning . : 16.385071689754017
_ — if anyone thinks that i amn ’ t divine he ’ ll get no free drinks when i ’ m making the wine but have to drink water and wish it were plain that i make when the wine becomes water again . _ he tugged swiftly at stephen ’ s ashplant in farewell and , running forward to a brow of the cliff , fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air , and chanted : _ — goodbye , now , goodbye ! : 11.352853236973589
write down all i said and tell tom , dick and harry i rose from the dead . : 11.730885441874191
what ’ s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly and olivet ’ s breezy ... : 15.944953408734774
haines , who had been laughing guardedly , walked on beside stephen and said : — we oughtn ’ t to laugh , i suppose . : 13.368064536541151
he ’ s rather blasphemous . : 36.90166071725582
i ’ m not a believer myself , that is to say . : 18.011792736873588
still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow , doesn ’ t it ? : 11.687222686014643
what did he call it ? : 38.982802501763636
joseph the joiner ? : 26.647380969094314
— the ballad of joking jesus , stephen answered . : 19.2608377472303
— o , haines said , you have heard it before ? : 29.192350670429224
— three times a day , after meals , stephen said drily . : 22.967501854892124
— you ’ re not a believer , are you ? : 20.042162076954096
haines asked . : 57.6214519920064
i mean , a believer in the narrow sense of the word . : 33.99929116112521
creation from nothing and miracles and a personal god . : 12.860539065074418
— there ’ s only one sense of the word , it seems to me , stephen said . : 20.885221616844316
haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone . : 11.853237875530995
he sprang it open with his thumb and offered it . : 20.555067133453935
— thank you , stephen said , taking a cigarette . : 26.08380183545267
haines helped himself and snapped the case to . : 18.52787154156435
he put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox , sprang it open too , and , having lit his cigarette , held the flaming spunk towards stephen in the shell of his hands . : 12.024421171930653
— yes , of course , he said , as they went on again . : 22.701027388361776
either you believe or you don ’ t , isn ’ t it ? : 12.279895504622937
personally i couldn ’ t stomach that idea of a personal god . : 14.082383009836244
you don ’ t stand for that , i suppose ? : 33.25277301919938
— you behold in me , stephen said with grim displeasure , a horrible example of free thought . : 13.8667179175771
he walked on , waiting to be spoken to , trailing his ashplant by his side . : 23.569042207428538
its ferrule followed lightly on the path , squealing at his heels . : 16.519282800032773
my familiar , after me , calling , steeeeeeeeeeeephen ! : 27.83054624055789
a wavering line along the path . : 34.349192166221485
they will walk on it tonight , coming here in the dark . : 22.89765182024665
he wants that key . : 47.17156078653507
it is mine . : 76.58162108061967
i paid the rent . : 45.85540305797571
now i eat his salt bread . : 18.11986960006047
give him the key too . : 30.199741279348537
all . : 148.50932529429676
he will ask for it . : 40.54311443094787
that was in his eyes . : 51.384689221213655
— after all , haines began ... : 44.52543864142189
stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind . : 18.063449307462143
— after all , i should think you are able to free yourself . : 24.36560437149818
you are your own master , it seems to me . : 23.491036860429286
— i am a servant of two masters , stephen said , an english and an italian . : 18.644927559090338
— italian ? : 140.15922304990835
haines said . : 42.046552810836346
a crazy queen , old and jealous . : 34.45689515644202
— and a third , stephen said , there is who wants me for odd jobs . : 21.74487725527502
haines said again . : 40.00111023904002
what do you mean ? : 48.13941792123931
— the imperial british state , stephen answered , his colour rising , and the holy roman catholic and apostolic church . : 14.870726272987184
haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke . : 12.272585387823176
— i can quite understand that , he said calmly . : 23.998822803990528
an irishman must think like that , i daresay . : 27.81707015312089
we feel in england that we have treated you rather unfairly . : 11.946574805430377
it seems history is to blame . : 24.897888660315388
the proud potent titles clanged over stephen ’ s memory the triumph of their brazen bells : _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam : _ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts , a chemistry of stars . : 6.985765835927015
symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope marcellus , the voices blended , singing alone loud in affirmation : and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs . : 8.122017132659382
a horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry : photius and the brood of mockers of whom mulligan was one , and arius , warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the son with the father , and valentine , spurning christ ’ s terrene body , and the subtle african heresiarch sabellius who held that the father was himself his own son . : 9.855812790395102
words mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger . : 15.156005852156675
idle mockery . : 39.161087755283305
the void awaits surely all them that weave the wind : a menace , a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church , michael ’ s host , who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields . : 11.642883965352386
hear , hear ! : 40.99565275721478
prolonged applause . : 33.00554332738112
_zut ! : 53.92878406661024
nom de dieu ! _ — of course i ’ m a britisher , haines ’ s voice said , and i feel as one . : 17.764597328894812
i don ’ t want to see my country fall into the hands of german jews either . : 13.44783993400266
that ’ s our national problem , i ’ m afraid , just now . : 15.620649781084486
two men stood at the verge of the cliff , watching : businessman , boatman . : 13.814684951028921
— she ’ s making for bullock harbour . : 27.564101767922647
the boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain . : 30.216757591411746
— there ’ s five fathoms out there , he said . : 18.632986794828383
it ’ ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one . : 15.718728571883052
it ’ s nine days today . : 29.137480786078985
the man that was drowned . : 58.53606350682214
a sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up , roll over to the sun a puffy face , saltwhite . : 12.208229753590226
here i am . : 63.86107264098529
they followed the winding path down to the creek . : 26.072556195540777
buck mulligan stood on a stone , in shirtsleeves , his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder . : 12.963803250548624
a young man clinging to a spur of rock near him , moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water . : 14.621993450948947
— is the brother with you , malachi ? : 42.83146845664284
— down in westmeath . : 66.62360248911943
with the bannons . : 66.955144996937
— still there ? : 98.42209006392186
i got a card from bannon . : 38.766239582275254
says he found a sweet young thing down there . : 17.634900733615208
photo girl he calls her . : 21.042219928132496
— snapshot , eh ? : 38.70367533123079
brief exposure . : 48.319856181956624
buck mulligan sat down to unlace his boots . : 14.02508323142887
an elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face . : 9.33284463125022
he scrambled up by the stones , water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair , water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth . : 10.121513247595471
— seymour ’ s back in town , the young man said , grasping again his spur of rock . : 21.593804489034707
chucked medicine and going in for the army . : 18.49432476743625
— ah , go to god ! : 51.03870689837815
— going over next week to stew . : 19.228784797708705
you know that red carlisle girl , lily ? : 18.268785499138957
— yes . : 83.1147784261534
— spooning with him last night on the pier . : 37.885863746271475
the father is rotto with money . : 29.836338543961737
— is she up the pole ? : 47.80452626888629
— better ask seymour that . : 27.25714297838306
— seymour a bleeding officer ! : 30.75495134743098
he nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up , saying tritely : — redheaded women buck like goats . : 15.82033052307907
he broke off in alarm , feeling his side under his flapping shirt . : 16.258285883638752
— my twelfth rib is gone , he cried . : 21.86719657723588
i ’ m the _übermensch . _ toothless kinch and i , the supermen . : 21.009685943873592
he struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay . : 20.397918287340126
— are you going in here , malachi ? : 29.318506763124898
make room in the bed . : 46.56575184636699
the young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes . : 13.50188818350827
haines sat down on a stone , smoking . : 26.239196637464214
— are you not coming in ? : 36.23542201349557
— later on , haines said . : 42.78503249655509
not on my breakfast . : 56.36552629659737
stephen turned away . : 65.63523134869601
— i ’ m going , mulligan , he said . : 18.171169181587423
— give us that key , kinch , buck mulligan said , to keep my chemise flat . : 14.658075696493468
stephen handed him the key . : 41.411884032741746
buck mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes . : 12.072704131621805
— and twopence , he said , for a pint . : 34.18624810352205
throw it there . : 41.84201472021587
stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap . : 25.711544926835057
dressing , undressing . : 24.736522247087088
buck mulligan erect , with joined hands before him , said solemnly : — he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord . : 20.101767338280098
thus spake zarathustra . : 22.403512328972262
his plump body plunged . : 41.31139375012996
— we ’ ll see you again , haines said , turning as stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild irish . : 12.58643746104631
horn of a bull , hoof of a horse , smile of a saxon . : 20.639995627996562

— _weep no more , _ comyn said . : 27.87872235695739
— go on then , talbot . : 37.644724128087866

— after , stephen said . : 39.33827549453713
go on , talbot . : 43.156582267220585
a swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel . : 13.084545281788532
he recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text : _ — weep no more , woful shepherds , weep no more for lycidas , your sorrow , is not dead , sunk though he be beneath the watery floor ... _ it must be a movement then , an actuality of the possible as possible . : 9.78743031858411
aristotle ’ s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of saint genevieve where he had read , sheltered from the sin of paris , night by night . : 10.179844677105331
by his elbow a delicate siamese conned a handbook of strategy . : 8.937658050030459
fed and feeding brains about me : under glowlamps , impaled , with faintly beating feelers : and in my mind ’ s darkness a sloth of the underworld , reluctant , shy of brightness , shifting her dragon scaly folds . : 7.0362667890917745
thought is the thought of thought . : 41.74540087191118
tranquil brightness . : 36.132278121675924
the soul is in a manner all that is : the soul is the form of forms . : 30.851535462033198
tranquility sudden , vast , candescent : form of forms . : 7.572190814486309
talbot repeated : _ — through the dear might of him that walked the waves , through the dear might ... _ — turn over , stephen said quietly . : 13.140232505822503
i don ’ t see anything . : 29.396478208710143
— what , sir ? : 61.46750205728163
talbot asked simply , bending forward . : 13.360550988834316
his hand turned the page over . : 34.479358411525354
he leaned back and went on again , having just remembered . : 29.37915562416498
of him that walked the waves . : 30.28042338685032
here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer ’ s heart and lips and on mine . : 11.183169610023164
it lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute . : 17.1674646079853
to caesar what is caesar ’ s , to god what is god ’ s . : 30.51107107712164
a long look from dark eyes , a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church ’ s looms . : 19.707409509261364

— have i heard all ? : 53.19483052703965
hockey at ten , sir . : 13.194660071676697
— half day , sir . : 37.8567613340736
thursday . : 79.879034597223
— who can answer a riddle ? : 26.12645453846971
they bundled their books away , pencils clacking , pages rustling . : 9.660889710790752
crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels , all gabbling gaily : — a riddle , sir ? : 7.366320114499282
ask me , sir . : 28.40071333633876
— o , ask me , sir . : 25.91693242115007
— a hard one , sir . : 41.977898684745476
— this is the riddle , stephen said : the cock crew , the sky was blue : the bells in heaven were striking eleven . : 16.074089384425996
’ tis time for this poor soul to go to heaven . : 22.918656263024197
what is that ? : 53.228328007669006
— again , sir . : 67.8014879065353
we didn ’ t hear . : 37.28437678642927
their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated . : 18.83277512203046
after a silence cochrane said : — what is it , sir ? : 19.593414185338915
we give it up . : 46.99518205614759
stephen , his throat itching , answered : — the fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush . : 14.47155637934771
he stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay . : 11.520048238614386
a stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called : — hockey ! : 29.50598460553594
they broke asunder , sidling out of their benches , leaping them . : 14.166208624483984
quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues . : 11.249321409099148
sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly , showing an open copybook . : 8.524738504645757
his tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading . : 7.936618049004468
on his cheek , dull and bloodless , a soft stain of ink lay , dateshaped , recent and damp as a snail ’ s bed . : 9.671268322239506
he held out his copybook . : 48.43865165538874
the word _sums_ was written on the headline . : 30.31485464790004
beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot . : 8.848006353395219
cyril sargent : his name and seal . : 15.280186685365196
— mr deasy told me to write them out all again , he said , and show them to you , sir . : 22.15639596209877
stephen touched the edges of the book . : 36.470453350487126
futility . : 67.94492493637387
— do you understand how to do them now ? : 28.769809642214334
— numbers eleven to fifteen , sargent answered . : 14.43642614605072
mr deasy said i was to copy them off the board , sir . : 19.07492106797371
— can you do them yourself ? : 36.32346864269354
— no , sir . : 40.49136670851072
ugly and futile : lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink , a snail ’ s bed . : 11.033474722848448
yet someone had loved him , borne him in her arms and in her heart . : 22.702785789162984
she had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own . : 12.520196602485457
was that then real ? : 51.48215395850402
his mother ’ s prostrate body the fiery columbanus in holy zeal bestrode . : 10.193798424006406
she was no more : the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire , an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes . : 16.40335867984285
she had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone , scarcely having been . : 12.932224514434955
a poor soul gone to heaven : and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox , red reek of rapine in his fur , with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth , listened , scraped up the earth , listened , scraped and scraped . : 9.223957621574502
sitting at his side stephen solved out the problem . : 19.463884320298146
he proves by algebra that shakespeare ’ s ghost is hamlet ’ s grandfather . : 17.795430646491255
sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses . : 11.546622228690367
hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom : the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field . : 19.046929044449342
across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice , in the mummery of their letters , wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes . : 8.133953530299223
give hands , traverse , bow to partner : so : imps of fancy of the moors . : 9.919060415169351
gone too from the world , averroes and moses maimonides , dark men in mien and movement , flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world , a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend . : 8.663090630605788
— do you understand now ? : 38.61618198647323
can you work the second for yourself ? : 26.492590957082903
in long shaky strokes sargent copied the data . : 13.390130856226145
waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols , a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin . : 9.773147643439543
_amor matris : _ subjective and objective genitive . : 10.981456928150864
with her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands . : 9.812619264823148
like him was i , these sloping shoulders , this gracelessness . : 20.050852558071973
my childhood bends beside me . : 25.138326799475653
too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly . : 20.301016078042217
mine is far and his secret as our eyes . : 16.964026769525052
secrets , silent , stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts : secrets weary of their tyranny : tyrants , willing to be dethroned . : 7.765513591864977
the sum was done . : 60.634662289729576
— it is very simple , stephen said as he stood up . : 24.315653950533893
thanks , sargent answered . : 19.962746307860957
he dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench . : 14.322991813865588
— you had better get your stick and go out to the others , stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy ’ s graceless form . : 18.763373933978034
in the corridor his name was heard , called from the playfield . : 22.213523606040926
— sargent ! : 163.42201154454125
— run on , stephen said . : 41.686700212043206
mr deasy is calling you . : 21.838997492576194
he stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife . : 11.373769969659213
they were sorted in teams and mr deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet . : 7.945736608263579
when he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him . : 11.343583403810614
he turned his angry white moustache . : 22.543839600352513
— what is it now ? : 43.27552743912899
he cried continually without listening . : 27.952094771268957
— cochrane and halliday are on the same side , sir , stephen said . : 16.924821262160428
— will you wait in my study for a moment , mr deasy said , till i restore order here . : 17.828509685280167
and as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man ’ s voice cried sternly : — what is the matter ? : 18.188274412091193
what is it now ? : 49.84397468311226
their sharp voices cried about him on all sides : their many forms closed round him , the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head . : 10.629555976194533
stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs . : 12.099074945451042
as on the first day he bargained with me here . : 27.104247970812622
as it was in the beginning , is now . : 35.75012804785233
on the sideboard the tray of stuart coins , base treasure of a bog : and ever shall be . : 11.182314606093385
and snug in their spooncase of purple plush , faded , the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles : world without end . : 10.62309694137748
a hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor . : 31.271151023878332
blowing out his rare moustache mr deasy halted at the table . : 14.439382644261258
— first , our little financial settlement , he said . : 17.01769790202979
he brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong . : 20.159747662001102
it slapped open and he took from it two notes , one of joined halves , and laid them carefully on the table . : 15.75920348778781
— two , he said , strapping and stowing his pocketbook away . : 16.559387386403905
and now his strongroom for the gold . : 35.47380164390883
stephen ’ s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar : whelks and money cowries and leopard shells : and this , whorled as an emir ’ s turban , and this , the scallop of saint james . : 9.986255072292398
an old pilgrim ’ s hoard , dead treasure , hollow shells . : 12.46786115022657
a sovereign fell , bright and new , on the soft pile of the tablecloth . : 22.51416749950869
— three , mr deasy said , turning his little savingsbox about in his hand . : 20.419809281655528
these are handy things to have . : 21.024881960258504
see . : 102.66689951201909
this is for sovereigns . : 34.805405023553554
this is for shillings . : 36.556285971895306
sixpences , halfcrowns . : 17.013816380690717
and here crowns . : 88.82281633979913
he shot from it two crowns and two shillings . : 19.927617450742105
— three twelve , he said . : 24.09857803609112
i think you ’ ll find that ’ s right . : 28.010723325148117
— thank you , sir , stephen said , gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers . : 13.854440105313248
— no thanks at all , mr deasy said . : 21.12978701120104
you have earned it . : 38.31552300136019
stephen ’ s hand , free again , went back to the hollow shells . : 23.94518369140293
symbols too of beauty and of power . : 22.913889679415394
a lump in my pocket : symbols soiled by greed and misery . : 14.136950718170066
— don ’ t carry it like that , mr deasy said . : 17.689897068582006
you ’ ll pull it out somewhere and lose it . : 20.309251528407543
you just buy one of these machines . : 29.997033342846525
you ’ ll find them very handy . : 19.77806114615363
answer something . : 64.53146530424361
— mine would be often empty , stephen said . : 18.512702438593756

— i foresee , mr deasy said , that you will not remain here very long at this work . : 14.713294009697803
you were not born to be a teacher , i think . : 22.804351195783827
perhaps i am wrong . : 43.114621195694745
— a learner rather , stephen said . : 18.70089550818537
and here what will you learn more ? : 33.36167094489898
mr deasy shook his head . : 26.95260148106083
— who knows ? : 104.80723382382838
to learn one must be humble . : 39.85400566126929
but life is the great teacher . : 56.27482906163523
stephen rustled the sheets again . : 28.304065739237195
— as regards these , he began . : 36.86843800837014
— yes , mr deasy said . : 20.83352300777972

— good morning , sir , stephen said again , bowing to his bent back . : 19.816889285752815
he went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees , hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield . : 13.021762639050372
the lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate : toothless terrors . : 20.257642219101797

mr deasy halted , breathing hard and swallowing his breath . : 13.06835427582114
— i just wanted to say , he said . : 27.311708409651125
do you know that ? : 33.45645526980618
and do you know why ? : 58.21919824257902
he frowned sternly on the bright air . : 38.88958847303877
— why , sir ? : 58.617711015472956
stephen asked , beginning to smile . : 29.893774989996057
— because she never let them in , mr deasy said solemnly . : 27.000762527406934
a coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm . : 13.167944487214658
he turned back quickly , coughing , laughing , his lifted arms waving to the air . : 16.646606360300805

it flows purling , widely flowing , floating foampool , flower unfurling . : 7.8582719654498385
under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway reluctant arms , hising up their petticoats , in whispering water swaying and upturning coy silver fronds . : 5.6771230776260015

he turned his face over a shoulder , rere regardant . : 20.371216996318093
moving through the air high spars of a threemaster , her sails brailed up on the crosstrees , homing , upstream , silently moving , a silent ship . : 9.73295407496456
— ii — [ <NUM> ] mr leopold bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls . : 22.895401641647485
he liked thick giblet soup , nutty gizzards , a stuffed roast heart , liverslices fried with crustcrumbs , fried hencods ’ roes . : 7.133463568913203
most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine . : 8.823696494749356
kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly , righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray . : 14.247530573095963
gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere . : 9.546122767632324
made him feel a bit peckish . : 32.223500979723056
the coals were reddening . : 48.64266847139536
another slice of bread and butter : three , four : right . : 13.421612267056418
she didn ’ t like her plate full . : 19.43635228130196

he turned from the tray , lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire . : 17.256497419673078
it sat there , dull and squat , its spout stuck out . : 14.663508600311062

the cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high . : 15.683970909326975
— mkgnao ! : 145.7480845640197
— o , there you are , mr bloom said , turning from the fire . : 24.123373580657077
the cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table , mewing . : 11.689763509934725
just how she stalks over my writingtable . : 13.99105842800148

scratch my head . : 31.98272738155336
mr bloom watched curiously , kindly the lithe black form . : 8.624639724863917
clean to see : the gloss of her sleek hide , the white button under the butt of her tail , the green flashing eyes . : 19.084452905922607
he bent down to her , his hands on his knees . : 41.50319823609433
— milk for the pussens , he said . : 29.304732401356443
— mrkgnao ! : 145.7480845640197
the cat cried . : 95.06879866179737
they call them stupid . : 40.07975746608633
they understand what we say better than we understand them . : 15.452219180665361
she understands all she wants to . : 26.666145093229336
vindictive too . : 27.507187877526675
cruel . : 95.18685489527789
her nature . : 148.95266460519883

— afraid of the chickens she is , he said mockingly . : 34.98793039850411
afraid of the chookchooks . : 45.40387645993064
i never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens . : 22.561313354014324
— mrkrgnao ! : 145.7480845640197
the cat said loudly . : 52.954178381437664
she blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes , mewing plaintively and long , showing him her milkwhite teeth . : 11.264370472044481
he watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones . : 11.789726402098104
then he went to the dresser , took the jug hanlon ’ s milkman had just filled for him , poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor . : 12.369007095774801
— gurrhr ! : 145.7480845640197
she cried , running to lap . : 26.396449625080532
he watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly . : 11.599959029259283
wonder is it true if you clip them they can ’ t mouse after . : 15.096924365545004
they shine in the dark , perhaps , the tips . : 34.104675527476864
or kind of feelers in the dark , perhaps . : 29.397966257547544
he listened to her licking lap . : 41.714278602067964
ham and eggs , no . : 18.883661063882563
no good eggs with this drouth . : 22.901263636303867

better a pork kidney at dlugacz ’ s . : 14.753415019171825
while the kettle is boiling . : 22.308922305797413
she lapped slower , then licking the saucer clean . : 15.395608460296648
why are their tongues so rough ? : 17.0801325560876
to lap better , all porous holes . : 30.83881918082343
nothing she can eat ? : 34.330782408524406
he glanced round him . : 53.86612330558936
on quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall , paused by the bedroom door . : 18.824506893384577
she might like something tasty . : 27.200482459220254
still perhaps : once in a way . : 26.195405736765267

fifteen multiplied by . : 31.52211222254719
the figures whitened in his mind , unsolved : displeased , he let them fade . : 18.809542194502676

a young white heifer . : 45.87102629575365

he held the page aslant patiently , bending his senses and his will , his soft subject gaze at rest . : 12.960190796883293
the porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile , wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace . : 11.730854924370265
— now , my miss , he said . : 29.438424084309037

— who are the letters for ? : 50.68485885039306
he looked at them . : 52.73034364431315

but he delayed to clear the chair : her striped petticoat , tossed soiled linen : and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed . : 10.895104115505974
as he went down the kitchen stairs she called : — poldy ! : 22.468368260454277
— scald the teapot . : 45.48975092152006
on the boil sure enough : a plume of steam from the spout . : 16.532138036505593
he scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea , tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in . : 11.493391735657548
having set it to draw he took off the kettle , crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt . : 10.31305376508649

pert little piece she was . : 16.66527619057226
he prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over : then fitted the teapot on the tray . : 14.30550826036473

— what a time you were ! : 59.09102374260628

she set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly , an elbow on the pillow . : 14.590618671913438
he looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs , sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat ’ s udder . : 10.851742297393525
the warmth of her couched body rose on the air , mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured . : 22.35013269919531
a strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow . : 13.792905807164452
in the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread . : 11.11258975745448

like foul flowerwater . : 53.738864763060896
— would you like the window open a little ? : 43.02385187196664

— did you hear that one , he asked them , about mulcahy from the coombe ? : 31.43743303620985

the caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles . : 14.675346115854925
— they tell the story , he said , that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs . : 15.775716701859217

_that ’ s not mulcahy_ , says he , _whoever done it_ . : 12.38137921019309
rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with corny kelleher , accepting the dockets given him , turning them over and scanning them as he walked . : 8.84259297303813
— that ’ s all done with a purpose , martin cunningham explained to hynes . : 17.49296740416337

o ’ molloy turned to stephen and said quietly and slowly : — one of the most polished periods i think i ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of seymour bushe . : 11.794909997789407
it was in that case of fratricide , the childs murder case . : 23.180921808356832
bushe defended him . : 22.3963067308001
_and in the porches of mine ear did pour . _ by the way how did he find that out ? : 15.182958898039157
he died in his sleep . : 64.63852880885321
— what was that ? : 61.54441425319694
the professor asked . : 83.82841375424569
italia , magistra artium — he spoke on the law of evidence , j . : 11.102429760854772
o ’ molloy said , of roman justice as contrasted with the earlier mosaic code , the _lex talionis_ . : 12.426614504446416
and he cited the moses of michelangelo in the vatican . : 20.98504384184682
— ha . : 152.6156832026812
— a few wellchosen words , lenehan prefaced . : 30.189826440609703
silence ! : 137.25909233979834
o ’ molloy took out his cigarettecase . : 19.243870193363733
false lull . : 48.63507770473356
something quite ordinary . : 43.25294876704211
messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar . : 9.686655373597992
i have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act , trivial in itself , that striking of that match , that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives . : 10.56508140345372
a polished period j . : 43.80520676390968
o ’ molloy resumed , moulding his words : — he said of it : _that stony effigy in frozen music , horned and terrible , of the human form divine , that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which , if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live , deserves to live . _ his slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall . : 8.374947336025592
— fine ! : 165.43708971895416
myles crawford said at once . : 18.847673605118764
— the divine afflatus , mr o ’ madden burke said . : 14.552968691837439
— you like it ? : 96.89918732995794
o ’ molloy asked stephen . : 21.03267421687063
stephen , his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture , blushed . : 12.436525583222021
o ’ molloy offered his case to myles crawford . : 12.884828921703942
lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy , saying : — muchibus thankibus . : 9.697794296402403
a man of high morale — professor magennis was speaking to me about you , j . : 13.312767681523985
o ’ molloy said to stephen . : 26.477152527690183
what do you think really of that hermetic crowd , the opal hush poets : a . : 16.109523442349243
the mastermystic ? : 209.27527354896432
that blavatsky woman started it . : 25.66271693643726
she was a nice old bag of tricks . : 24.165543397820965
has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness . : 13.96816488791328
magennis thinks you must have been pulling a . : 13.978216627979704
e .’ s leg . : 27.974933151006063
he is a man of the very highest morale , magennis . : 26.67808466529081
speaking about me . : 36.79887915895216
what did he say ? : 44.25626102471318
what did he say about me ? : 28.51535569196208
don ’ t ask . : 27.17693144266337
wait a moment . : 36.94283913094776
let me say one thing . : 26.678588359469135
the finest display of oratory i ever heard was a speech made by john f taylor at the college historical society . : 12.677446963425803
mr justice fitzgibbon , the present lord justice of appeal , had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay ( new for those days ), advocating the revival of the irish tongue . : 10.110897394570625
then you can imagine the style of his discourse . : 27.276626649351467
— he is sitting with tim healy , j . : 15.39755920104418
o ’ molloy said , rumour has it , on the trinity college estates commission . : 15.834834595371136
— he is sitting with a sweet thing , myles crawford said , in a child ’ s frock . : 24.951616679195784
go on . : 78.16044121895767
— it was the speech , mark you , the professor said , of a finished orator , full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction i will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man ’ s contumely upon the new movement . : 10.964893950834556
it was then a new movement . : 45.64274741165634
we were weak , therefore worthless . : 16.864689896220938
he closed his long thin lips an instant but , eager to be on , raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and , with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims , steadied them to a new focus . : 11.282387315969494
impromptu in ferial tone he addressed j . : 7.7365046390559264
o ’ molloy : — taylor had come there , you must know , from a sickbed . : 19.50919541340445
that he had prepared his speech i do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall . : 16.396919278020587
he wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked ( though he was not ) a dying man . : 12.617996414073971
o ’ molloy ’ s towards stephen ’ s face and then bent at once to the ground , seeking . : 19.167141548072312
his unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head , soiled by his withering hair . : 11.85944600837891
still seeking , he said : — when fitzgibbon ’ s speech had ended john f taylor rose to reply . : 11.478462258003459
briefly , as well as i can bring them to mind , his words were these . : 19.39231335729721
he raised his head firmly . : 57.48253241514649
his eyes bethought themselves once more . : 23.588014620408565
witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro , seeking outlet . : 8.8346412703254
he began : _ — mr chairman , ladies and gentlemen : great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of ireland a moment since by my learned friend . : 10.808336062606832
it seemed to me that i had been transported into a country far away from this country , into an age remote from this age , that i stood in ancient egypt and that i was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful moses . _ his listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear , their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech . : 11.726063912386952
_and let our crooked smokes . _ noble words coming . : 10.010551949021684
look out . : 75.73778669965559
could you try your hand at it yourself ? : 24.575582161112795
_ — and it seemed to me that i heard the voice of that egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride . : 14.66071320163246
i heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me . _ from the fathers it was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted . : 10.158361696947914
ah , curse you ! : 26.318440904938644
that ’ s saint augustine . : 36.6097280563531
you are a tribe of nomad herdsmen : we are a mighty people . : 13.767343792230989
you have no cities nor no wealth : our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys , trireme and quadrireme , laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe . : 6.100872063100118
you have but emerged from primitive conditions : we have a literature , a priesthood , an agelong history and a polity . _ nile . : 12.588832936002095
child , man , effigy . : 30.176573150115388
by the nilebank the babemaries kneel , cradle of bulrushes : a man supple in combat : stonehorned , stonebearded , heart of stone . : 6.601899032998652
_ — you pray to a local and obscure idol : our temples , majestic and mysterious , are the abodes of isis and osiris , of horus and ammon ra . : 6.614917363404856
yours serfdom , awe and humbleness : ours thunder and the seas . : 8.99855972539642
israel is weak and few are her children : egypt is an host and terrible are her arms . : 7.0934791080615
vagrants and daylabourers are you called : the world trembles at our name . _ a dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech . : 9.987786594115057
he lifted his voice above it boldly : _ — but , ladies and gentlemen , had the youthful moses listened to and accepted that view of life , had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage , nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day . : 9.892676987468269
he would never have spoken with the eternal amid lightnings on sinai ’ s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law , graven in the language of the outlaw . _ he ceased and looked at them , enjoying a silence . : 11.675042799526882
ominous — for him ! : 30.89019097831332
o ’ molloy said not without regret : — and yet he died without having entered the land of promise . : 10.341130824714444
and with a great future behind him . : 38.61897322596155
the troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase . : 10.459651240807009
— that is oratory , the professor said uncontradicted . : 25.984877820545844

— you take my breath away . : 28.24159896417803
it is not perchance a french compliment ? : 22.180182005640354
mr o ’ madden burke asked . : 20.734936736303304

to which particular boosing shed ...? : 28.326069603399283
my casting vote is : mooney ’ s ! : 22.625616782720297
he led the way , admonishing : — we will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters , will we not ? : 12.990658773637813
yes , we will not . : 42.19838982285528
by no manner of means . : 32.95791564198055
mr o ’ madden burke , following close , said with an ally ’ s lunge of his umbrella : — lay on , macduff ! : 17.378513008034286
— chip of the old block ! : 58.214743525673654

let us go . : 46.94286770872499
where are those blasted keys ? : 25.218848852210726

that ’ ll go in . : 45.039361395052545

he thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office . : 23.23084160278652
let us hope j . : 25.86062858044625
o ’ molloy , about to follow him in , said quietly to stephen : — i hope you will live to see it published . : 18.848461974209968
myles , one moment . : 40.49098856913981
he went into the inner office , closing the door behind him . : 20.392095820850503
— come along , stephen , the professor said . : 29.932455274565633

maybe , like socrates , he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife . : 13.401656774560317
but she , the giglot wanton , did not break a bedvow . : 17.924862307078865

stephen turned boldly in his chair . : 32.561501787545446
— the burden of proof is with you not with me , he said frowning . : 21.125824091712627
if you deny that in the fifth scene of _hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him . : 12.203047226175157
all those women saw their men down and under : mary , her goodman john , ann , her poor dear willun , when he went and died on her , raging that he was the first to go , joan , her four brothers , judith , her husband and all her sons , susan , her husband too , while susan ’ s daughter , elizabeth , to use granddaddy ’ s words , wed her second , having killed her first . : 10.993147767711312

he faced their silence . : 40.36173458320939
to whom thus eglinton : you mean the will . : 24.691338227916127
but that has been explained , i believe , by jurists . : 27.299836361235275
she was entitled to her widow ’ s dower at common law . : 17.262022104467814

— pretty countryfolk had few chattels then , john eglinton observed , as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type . : 9.883917369947229
— he was a rich country gentleman , stephen said , with a coat of arms and landed estate at stratford and a house in ireland yard , a capitalist shareholder , a bill promoter , a tithefarmer . : 14.756366347972838
why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace ? : 13.265238170087493
— it is clear that there were two beds , a best and a secondbest , mr secondbest best said finely . : 16.242190309002687

o , that was a very nice name to have . : 30.34666606225878
father conmee gave a letter from his breast to master brunny lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of fitzgibbon street . : 11.973054025985075
— but mind you don ’ t post yourself into the box , little man , he said . : 14.827625546197536

mr denis j maginni , professor of dancing & c , in silk hat , slate frockcoat with silk facings , white kerchief tie , tight lavender trousers , canary gloves and pointed patent boots , walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady maxwell at the corner of dignam ’ s court . : 7.8055691902655076

mrs m ’ guinness , stately , silverhaired , bowed to father conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed . : 9.9857487528474
and father conmee smiled and saluted . : 31.961081455904807
how did she do ? : 40.5338765141165
a fine carriage she had . : 47.96344426638414

such a queenly mien . : 24.45052401230372
father conmee walked down great charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left . : 12.070273136653546
the reverend t . : 84.13342433011563

he felt it incumbent on him to say a few words . : 26.533838354171365
but one should be charitable . : 39.24866006422694
invincible ignorance . : 35.84358781778868
they acted according to their lights . : 32.77211662589618
father conmee turned the corner and walked along the north circular road . : 15.866097579453726
it was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare . : 16.79303415525003
surely , there ought to be . : 26.48985710460852
a band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from richmond street . : 13.486975130363426
all raised untidy caps . : 35.77908224164971
father conmee greeted them more than once benignly . : 13.96913674093284
christian brother boys . : 26.89158385133723
father conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked . : 18.73727419838503
saint joseph ’ s church , portland row . : 17.494016372267275
for aged and virtuous females . : 28.17985341004217
father conmee raised his hat to the blessed sacrament . : 27.7358609965109
virtuous : but occasionally they were also badtempered . : 14.025515753605907
near aldborough house father conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman . : 13.84462612885438
and now it was an office or something . : 37.306370793474755
father conmee began to walk along the north strand road and was saluted by mr william gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop . : 14.850758108502296
father conmee saluted mr william gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter . : 5.971532832479837
he passed grogan ’ s the tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in new york . : 10.51696239544002
in america those things were continually happening . : 19.746630218764807
unfortunate people to die like that , unprepared . : 17.992953131278462
still , an act of perfect contrition . : 25.611083620280574
father conmee went by daniel bergin ’ s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged . : 12.463764415985231
they saluted him and were saluted . : 37.18400332732899
father conmee passed h . : 25.8810363393796
o ’ neill ’ s funeral establishment where corny kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay . : 10.492635748705892
a constable on his beat saluted father conmee and father conmee saluted the constable . : 17.42020330969477
in youkstetter ’ s , the porkbutcher ’ s , father conmee observed pig ’ s puddings , white and black and red , lie neatly curled in tubes . : 15.419682032558649
moored under the trees of charleville mall father conmee saw a turfbarge , a towhorse with pendent head , a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships , smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him . : 7.267708290698872
it was idyllic : and father conmee reflected on the providence of the creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people . : 13.146120887534206
on newcomen bridge the very reverend john conmee s . : 16.187917952430457
of saint francis xavier ’ s church , upper gardiner street , stepped on to an outward bound tram . : 14.957521633436759
off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend nicholas dudley c . : 10.817742351489082
of saint agatha ’ s church , north william street , on to newcomen bridge . : 23.893450838749864
at newcomen bridge father conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past mud island . : 7.8145604549646075
father conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar , a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove , while four shillings , a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse . : 11.585948052851064
the solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to father conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap . : 19.691060500256594
father conmee liked cheerful decorum . : 18.186447927502584
the gentleman with the glasses opposite father conmee had finished explaining and looked down . : 18.38102013763718
his wife , father conmee supposed . : 43.39434547557096
father conmee perceived her perfume in the car . : 24.30935064760593
he perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat . : 23.11070768659925
father conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head . : 16.704439113832432
at annesley bridge the tram halted and , when it was about to go , an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight . : 16.16366956737745
the conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her . : 15.74063958269437
she passed out with her basket and a marketnet : and father conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down : and father conmee thought that , as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare , she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice _bless you , my child , _ that they have been absolved , _pray for me . _ but they had so many worries in life , so many cares , poor creatures . : 13.349965085762562
from the hoardings mr eugene stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at father conmee . : 8.61711518040074
father conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint peter claver s . : 11.653395442061171
and the african mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night . : 13.187396821281395
that book by the belgian jesuit , _le nombre des élus , _ seemed to father conmee a reasonable plea . : 9.746366104860487
those were millions of human souls created by god in his own likeness to whom the faith had not ( d . v .) been brought . : 10.594964096993326
but they were god ’ s souls , created by god . : 22.06141681059813
it seemed to father conmee a pity that they should all be lost , a waste , if one might say . : 14.967263699733337
at the howth road stop father conmee alighted , was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn . : 14.954216639376552
the malahide road was quiet . : 33.29706372218269
it pleased father conmee , road and name . : 21.446583799502577
the joybells were ringing in gay malahide . : 18.827462175215295
lord talbot de malahide , immediate hereditary lord admiral of malahide and the seas adjoining . : 8.099264517792616
then came the call to arms and she was maid , wife and widow in one day . : 16.337215017395156
those were old worldish days , loyal times in joyous townlands , old times in the barony . : 11.360541709086576
father conmee , walking , thought of his little book _old times in the barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of mary rochfort , daughter of lord molesworth , first countess of belvedere . : 10.667012767013716
a listless lady , no more young , walked alone the shore of lough ennel , mary , first countess of belvedere , listlessly walking in the evening , not startled when an otter plunged . : 8.867010383068319
who could know the truth ? : 41.13355265371365
not the jealous lord belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully , _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris , _ with her husband ’ s brother ? : 8.162717094921659
she would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did . : 13.847434186375537
only god knew and she and he , her husband ’ s brother . : 29.767225560761165
father conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence , needed however for man ’ s race on earth , and of the ways of god which were not our ways . : 11.914711113899964
don john conmee walked and moved in times of yore . : 13.351608699557044
he was humane and honoured there . : 21.068156660902947
he bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom , ceiled with full fruit clusters . : 7.785399498965899
and the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom , noble to noble , were impalmed by don john conmee . : 13.743644754674591
it was a charming day . : 39.50934872396788
the lychgate of a field showed father conmee breadths of cabbages , curtseying to him with ample underleaves . : 12.955902529990583
the sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind . : 13.490166368366074
_moutonner , _ the french said . : 23.88571178203508
a just and homely word . : 35.20805259534054
father conmee , reading his office , watched a flock of muttoning clouds over rathcoffey . : 8.516011250193861
his thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of clongowes field . : 13.343044154961303
he walked there , reading in the evening , and heard the cries of the boys ’ lines at their play , young cries in the quiet evening . : 21.368228409101523
he was their rector : his reign was mild . : 14.756074661402309
father conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out . : 11.792928391054526
an ivory bookmark told him the page . : 31.493661171416882
nones . : 67.94492493637387
he should have read that before lunch . : 28.968895877347634
but lady maxwell had come . : 26.91458932009596
father conmee read in secret _pater_ and _ave_ and crossed his breast . : 8.551489353098987
_deus in adiutorium . _ he walked calmly and read mutely the nones , walking and reading till he came to _res_ in _beati immaculati : principium verborum tuorum veritas : in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ . _ a flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand . : 6.5551914073513045
the young man raised his cap abruptly : the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig . : 10.617500813926885
father conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary . : 13.33405749486578
_sin : principes persecuti sunt me gratis : et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum . _ * * * corny kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner . : 5.80377141759368
he pulled himself erect , went to it and , spinning it on its axle , viewed its shape and brass furnishings . : 11.811842536498656
chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway . : 11.014167626593261
there he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase , looking idly out . : 11.65157340275772
father john conmee stepped into the dollymount tram on newcomen bridge . : 12.78523903815379
constable <NUM> c , on his beat , stood to pass the time of day . : 43.37779808327724
— that ’ s a fine day , mr kelleher . : 28.384220797685483
— ay , corny kelleher said . : 25.85621961139835
— it ’ s very close , the constable said . : 26.655627093529695
corny kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in eccles street flung forth a coin . : 7.072546603969697
— i seen that particular party last evening , the constable said with bated breath . : 14.844116448831167
* * * a onelegged sailor crutched himself round macconnell ’ s corner , skirting rabaiotti ’ s icecream car , and jerked himself up eccles street . : 8.193479845944205
towards larry o ’ rourke , in shirtsleeves in his doorway , he growled unamiably : — _for england_ ... : 16.221144221932597
he swung himself violently forward past katey and boody dedalus , halted and growled : — _home and beauty . _ j . : 10.225771716730048
a stout lady stopped , took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her . : 13.279805013798555
the sailor grumbled thanks , glanced sourly at the unheeding windows , sank his head and swung himself forward four strides . : 10.9798654623803
he halted and growled angrily : — _for england_ ... : 18.411191269699017
two barefoot urchins , sucking long liquorice laces , halted near him , gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths . : 9.703173136168793
he swung himself forward in vigorous jerks , halted , lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply : — _home and beauty . _ the gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two , ceased . : 9.647564638108415
the blind of the window was drawn aside . : 38.499461679518994
a card _unfurnished apartments_ slipped from the sash and fell . : 16.592284591146992
a plump bare generous arm shone , was seen , held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps . : 11.974618353700519
a woman ’ s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings . : 17.617846282796577
it fell on the path . : 61.577403650657025
one of the urchins ran to it , picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel ’ s cap , saying : — there , sir . : 17.37698840294305
* * * katey and boody dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen . : 11.337552441800488
— did you put in the books ? : 56.68013373296383
boody asked . : 34.97601186562568
maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow . : 7.522855172675497
— they wouldn ’ t give anything on them , she said . : 21.31054325643463
father conmee walked through clongowes fields , his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble . : 10.531530110681535
— where did you try ? : 53.364346831690874
— m ’ guinness ’ s . : 34.287157405359444
boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table . : 12.955095369156716
— bad cess to her big face ! : 25.428201764540695
she cried . : 87.83263540697706
katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes . : 13.57778362616006

in inisfail the fair there lies a land , the land of holy michan . : 17.6050824026079
there rises a watchtower beheld of men afar . : 14.397242167292806
there sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept , warriors and princes of high renown . : 8.678205626971954
a pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters , fishful streams where sport the gurnard , the plaice , the roach , the halibut , the gibbed haddock , the grilse , the dab , the brill , the flounder , the pollock , the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated . : 11.855690841349846
in the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage , the wafty sycamore , the lebanonian cedar , the exalted planetree , the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied . : 9.911412020052845
lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots , silvery fishes , crans of herrings , drafts of eels , codlings , creels of fingerlings , purple seagems and playful insects . : 5.507148905353013

come out here , geraghty , you notorious bloody hill and dale robber ! : 13.879576573957046
and by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and cuffe ’ s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves : and there is ever heard a trampling , cackling , roaring , lowing , bleating , bellowing , rumbling , grunting , champing , chewing , of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of lusk and rush and carrickmines and from the streamy vales of thomond , from the m ’ gillicuddy ’ s reeks the inaccessible and lordly shannon the unfathomable , and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of kiar , their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer ’ s firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds , various in size , the agate with this dun . : 4.567675592265056
so we turned into barney kiernan ’ s and there , sure enough , was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel , garryowen , and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink . : 16.3282981179738
— there he is , says i , in his gloryhole , with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers , working for the cause . : 17.007999603992815
the bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps . : 19.13111451479374
be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog . : 14.63675113253661
i ’ m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence . : 14.518387220569625

friends here . : 56.219307732025
— pass , friends , says he . : 24.10889943766967
then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he : — what ’ s your opinion of the times ? : 23.076611472906734
but , begob , joe was equal to the occasion . : 22.854285609978625
— i think the markets are on a rise , says he , sliding his hand down his fork . : 17.805816325614956
so begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says : — foreign wars is the cause of it . : 17.07257576739976
and says joe , sticking his thumb in his pocket : — it ’ s the russians wish to tyrannise . : 16.73312537517618
— arrah , give over your bloody codding , joe , says i . : 12.267671337124844

and with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and , by jesus , he near throttled him . : 26.39843368652822
the figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero . : 7.145148314549185
from shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered , as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible , with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse ( _ulex europeus_ ). : 7.399783855357007
the widewinged nostrils , from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected , were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest . : 8.264481253190471
the eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower . : 21.360391954074966
a powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground , the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble . : 8.476263350376206
he wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes . : 8.912270423397773
beneath this he wore trews of deerskin , roughly stitched with gut . : 6.726429061980495
his nether extremities were encased in high balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple , the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast . : 8.04070603767698
from his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many irish heroes and heroines of antiquity , cuchulin , conn of hundred battles , niall of nine hostages , brian of kincora , the ardri malachi , art macmurragh , shane o ’ neill , father john murphy , owen roe , patrick sarsfield , red hugh o ’ donnell , red jim macdermott , soggarth eoghan o ’ growney , michael dwyer , francy higgins , henry joy m ’ cracken , goliath , horace wheatley , thomas conneff , peg woffington , the village blacksmith , captain moonlight , captain boycott , dante alighieri , christopher columbus , s . : 4.100054600357787

a couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber , a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone . : 6.2480059927830025
so anyhow terry brought the three pints joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when i saw him land out a quid . : 9.939656603895843

terence o ’ ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers bungiveagh and bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats , cunning as the sons of deathless leda . : 7.618096299640729
for they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil , those cunning brothers , lords of the vat . : 7.287051537976654

but he , the young chief of the o ’ bergan ’ s , could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze . : 9.563704062933912
thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port , scion of the house of brunswick , victoria her name , her most excellent majesty , by grace of god of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland and of the british dominions beyond the sea , queen , defender of the faith , empress of india , even she , who bore rule , a victress over many peoples , the wellbeloved , for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof , the pale , the dark , the ruddy and the ethiop . : 11.399998750359444

in the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible , the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face . : 8.328624566075565
communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus . : 7.411252150888583
questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels . : 9.642558822833946
in reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them . : 13.127551036490509
interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā , ālāvātār , hātākāldā , wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature . : 6.4669419711667295
having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief . : 7.532565798043461
asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that mars and jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power . : 8.594195636791213

before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to cullen ’ s to be soled only as the heels were still good . : 13.008065280690364
he stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known . : 10.190465052203942
assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction . : 12.19527530153652

he ’ s over all his troubles . : 38.05887335488753
but bob doran shouts out of him . : 26.229635067569095
— he ’ s a bloody ruffian , i say , to take away poor little willy dignam . : 18.4834509855939
and bob doran starts doing the weeps about paddy dignam , true as you ’ re there . : 13.799466465860855
— the finest man , says he , snivelling , the finest purest character . : 20.80888876191472
the tear is bloody near your eye . : 19.26322508272632
talking through his bloody hat . : 27.952601023268755
fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married , mooney , the bumbailiff ’ s daughter , mother kept a kip in hardwicke street , that used to be stravaging about the landings bantam lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her , exposing her person , open to all comers , fair field and no favour . : 10.543104693119115
— the noblest , the truest , says he . : 26.478414351347155
and mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven . : 14.642945515220832
old garryowen started growling again at bloom that was skeezing round the door . : 15.877124569849386
— come in , come on , he won ’ t eat you , says the citizen . : 22.282924213759678

— o , christ m ’ keown , says joe , reading one of the letters . : 19.790559991022047

hello , bloom , says he , what will you have ? : 27.23243106529397
so they started arguing about the point , bloom saying he wouldn ’ t and he couldn ’ t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he ’ d just take a cigar . : 14.729569263283294
gob , he ’ s a prudent member and no mistake . : 13.854661357297822
— give us one of your prime stinkers , terry , says joe . : 15.309533311826561
and alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it . : 16.244401041933116
— they ’ re all barbers , says he , from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses . : 12.18982417638877
and he was telling us there ’ s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull . : 8.997004811079435
in the dark land they bide , the vengeful knights of the razor . : 19.60768682781981
their deadly coil they grasp : yea , and therein they lead to erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for i will on nowise suffer it even so saith the lord . : 6.481413120454962
so they started talking about capital punishment and of course bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time i ’ m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about i don ’ t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on . : 10.467645300855999

— the poor bugger ’ s tool that ’ s being hanged , says alf . : 21.721735963892403
— god ’ s truth , says alf . : 35.39370693839134
i heard that from the head warder that was in kilmainham when they hanged joe brady , the invincible . : 20.10977423704967
he told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker . : 25.187992059190584
— ruling passion strong in death , says joe , as someone said . : 19.154540858821612
— that can be explained by science , says bloom . : 20.372485678746944
it ’ s only a natural phenomenon , don ’ t you see , because on account of the ... : 17.01399828874007
and then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon . : 15.365574679541938
the distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would , according to the best approved tradition of medical science , be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus , thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis . _ so of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged , drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new ireland and new this , that and the other . : 8.542855022994605
talking about new ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought . : 16.884915626047377
mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs . : 7.478998636253516
and round he goes to bob doran that was standing alf a half one sucking up for what he could get . : 18.77082520964026
so of course bob doran starts doing the bloody fool with him : — give us the paw ! : 18.810361540967136
give the paw , doggy ! : 19.189429731515858
good old doggy ! : 44.34991012257492

give us the paw ! : 31.387631815129833
arrah , bloody end to the paw he ’ d paw and alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog : give you the bloody pip . : 9.192110476665517
then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a jacobs ’ tin he told terry to bring . : 13.131166137675798
gob , he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more . : 14.412971006085058
near ate the tin and all , hungry bloody mongrel . : 15.223292579536887
and the citizen and bloom having an argument about the point , the brothers sheares and wolfe tone beyond on arbour hill and robert emmet and die for your country , the tommy moore touch about sara curran and she ’ s far from the land . : 10.333382509077934
and bloom , of course , with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face . : 18.361927394794296
phenomenon ! : 116.16934485216937
time they were stopping up in the _city arms_ pisser burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk . : 12.45337570103778
and one time he led him the rounds of dublin and , by the holy farmer , he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings , if the three women didn ’ t near roast him , it ’ s a queer story , the old one , bloom ’ s wife and mrs o ’ dowd that kept the hotel . : 14.384924343243265
jesus , i had to laugh at pisser burke taking them off chewing the fat . : 11.559118052657475
and bloom with his _but don ’ t you see ? _ and _but on the other hand_ . : 22.639639184187217
and sure , more be token , the lout i ’ m told was in power ’ s after , the blender ’ s , round in cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment . : 14.818002388904342
— the memory of the dead , says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at bloom . : 15.522627456309824
— ay , ay , says joe . : 18.20405924251165
— you don ’ t grasp my point , says bloom . : 17.51198718366714
what i mean is ... : 49.397350942311874
— _sinn fein ! _ says the citizen . : 26.464893072190915
_sinn fein amhain ! _ the friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us . : 8.652568589644586
the last farewell was affecting in the extreme . : 31.378741512559714
from the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance . : 7.180141979439916
the deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle . : 7.417982698750297
a torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons . : 11.170278049865109
a posse of dublin metropolitan police superintended by the chief commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the york street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by speranza ’ s plaintive muse . : 6.838360026493024

our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies . : 6.891820778710588
the children of the male and female foundling hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day ’ s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the little sisters of the poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat . : 9.625817368752463
the viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by their excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the friends of the emerald isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite . : 8.278086449713646

an animated altercation ( in which all took part ) ensued among the f . : 11.900154616271537
as to whether the eighth or the ninth of march was the correct date of the birth of ireland ’ s patron saint . : 13.72344188177486
in the course of the argument cannonballs , scimitars , boomerangs , blunderbusses , stinkpots , meatchoppers , umbrellas , catapults , knuckledusters , sandbags , lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged . : 4.678570945211444

quietly , unassumingly rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower , the _gladiolus cruentus_ . : 8.166541500265621
he announced his presence by that gentle rumboldian cough which so many have tried ( unsuccessfully ) to imitate — short , painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man . : 7.33091284379129
the arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse , the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries , _hoch , banzai , eljen , zivio , chinchin , polla kronia , hiphip , vive , allah_ , amid which the ringing _evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song ( a high double f recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers ) was easily distinguishable . : 5.818776706958606
it was exactly seventeen o ’ clock . : 23.03982959947885
the signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared , the commendatore ’ s patriarchal sombrero , which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of rienzi , being removed by his medical adviser in attendance , dr pippi . : 9.546302721906759
the learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater , his cassock above his hoary head , and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication . : 9.50762861314269
hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner , his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously . : 9.798998853116943
as he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office . : 6.154434315047703
on a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife , the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances ( specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers , messrs john round and sons , sheffield ), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum , colon , blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim . : 5.71548884714363
the housesteward of the amalgamated cats ’ and dogs ’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution . : 9.07702034128344
quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs , fried steak and onions , done to a nicety , delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he , with an abnegation rare in these our times , rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish ( immediately acceded to ) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers ’ association as a token of his regard and esteem . : 7.192547950943036
the _nec_ and _non plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake . : 9.163886223253588
the hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly _sheila , my own_ . : 11.314891253739084
encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach . : 7.939840229075256
she swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory , that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in clonturk park . : 11.946672314369875
she brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of anna liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and , oblivious of the dreadful present , they both laughed heartily , all the spectators , including the venerable pastor , joining in the general merriment . : 11.53750247949823
that monster audience simply rocked with delight . : 15.091017004334317
but anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time . : 14.55195862465337
a fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people , touched to the inmost core , broke into heartrending sobs , not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself . : 8.446765233035224
big strong men , officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal irish constabulary , were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage . : 12.797951515461806
a most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young oxford graduate , noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex , stepped forward and , presenting his visiting card , bankbook and genealogical tree , solicited the hand of the hapless young lady , requesting her to name the day , and was accepted on the spot . : 8.465902124917534
every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch , a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion : and when the gallant young oxonian ( the bearer , by the way , of one of the most timehonoured names in albion ’ s history ) placed on the finger of his blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds . : 9.419357746401012
nay , even the stern provostmarshal , lieutenantcolonel tomkin - maxwell ffrenchmullan tomlinson , who presided on the sad occasion , he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching , could not now restrain his natural emotion . : 7.436953738460016
with his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard , by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage , _ to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone : — god blimey if she aint a clinker , that there bleeding tart . : 9.088957159356855
blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry , straight , it does , when i sees her cause i thinks of my old mashtub what ’ s waiting for me down limehouse way . : 10.152462140273805
so then the citizen begins talking about the irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can ’ t speak their own language and joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of joe and talking about the gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink , the curse of ireland . : 12.428870619033178
antitreating is about the size of it . : 16.62798095874017
gob , he ’ d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the lord would call him before you ’ d ever see the froth of his pint . : 13.611249813381194
and one night i went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings , song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my maureen lay and there was a fellow with a ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns , gob , flahoolagh entertainment , don ’ t be talking . : 8.536786483032405
ireland sober is ireland free . : 17.123690854155896
and then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of . : 13.338367129214587
and one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females , hitting below the belt . : 9.761092171196971
so howandever , as i was saying , the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by joe and me . : 13.111162399885263
i ’ d train him by kindness , so i would , if he was my dog . : 19.31798217842712
give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn ’ t blind him . : 10.354223993554307
— afraid he ’ ll bite you ? : 35.74025971888957
says the citizen , jeering . : 21.64499538427435
— no , says i . : 34.997637341345815
but he might take my leg for a lamppost . : 26.73380267022414
so he calls the old dog over . : 30.75805764611582
— what ’ s on you , garry ? : 32.30800054169633
then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in irish and the old towser growling , letting on to answer , like a duet in the opera . : 14.226835509009035
such growling you never heard as they let off between them . : 16.707936336223355
someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that . : 13.284570606409352
growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws . : 16.209558282677403
all those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals ( and their name is legion ) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_ of garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances owen garry . : 7.011413591627048
the exhibition , which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system , comprises , among other achievements , the recitation of verse . : 10.468149143361458
our greatest living phonetic expert ( wild horses shall not drag it from us !) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_ resemblance ( the italics are ours ) to the ranns of ancient celtic bards . : 5.335563602138193
we are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the little sweet branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather ( as a contributor d . : 7.790513151799527
points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary ) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous raftery and of donal macconsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye . : 10.796008197373817
we subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into english by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication . : 7.040186169862636
the metrical system of the canine original , which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the welsh englyn , is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught . : 8.738213090243153
perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if owen ’ s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour . : 7.776423934963714
the curse of my curses seven days every day and seven dry thursdays on you , barney kiernan , has no sup of water to cool my courage , and my guts red roaring after lowry ’ s lights . : 9.596676543915848
so he told terry to bring some water for the dog and , gob , you could hear him lapping it up a mile off . : 16.639889357691633
and joe asked him would he have another . : 30.56646474746848
— i will , says he , _a chara_ , to show there ’ s no ill feeling . : 17.631541010512745
gob , he ’ s not as green as he ’ s cabbagelooking . : 19.839565364711486
arsing around from one pub to another , leaving it to your own honour , with old giltrap ’ s dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators . : 10.6748734413813
entertainment for man and beast . : 17.48454500217454
and says joe : — could you make a hole in another pint ? : 27.837772714919975
— could a swim duck ? : 31.794466862541086
— same again , terry , says joe . : 23.529467412104232
are you sure you won ’ t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment ? : 17.292561558159683
— thank you , no , says bloom . : 32.79500496719579
as a matter of fact i just wanted to meet martin cunningham , don ’ t you see , about this insurance of poor dignam ’ s . : 11.197218029245823
martin asked me to go to the house . : 34.99179185210575
you see , he , dignam , i mean , didn ’ t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can ’ t recover on the policy . : 17.09549385762729
— holy wars , says joe , laughing , that ’ s a good one if old shylock is landed . : 12.798783638735207
so the wife comes out top dog , what ? : 21.74929073389133
— well , that ’ s a point , says bloom , for the wife ’ s admirers . : 30.346639153317646
— whose admirers ? : 70.49773206717356
— the wife ’ s advisers , i mean , says bloom . : 24.884685742214256
then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that dignam owed bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee ’ s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act . : 12.318415632779361
he was bloody safe he wasn ’ t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court . : 11.77965259185569
selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal hungarian privileged lottery . : 9.125859044768754
true as you ’ re there . : 23.792658476937046
o , commend me to an israelite ! : 24.7559354351545
royal and privileged hungarian robbery . : 14.40825097508681
choking with bloody foolery . : 14.238954598300612
and shaking bloom ’ s hand doing the tragic to tell her that . : 21.105663409422963
shake hands , brother . : 32.076316662910514
you ’ re a rogue and i ’ m another . : 17.913315705671153
— let me , said he , so far presume upon our acquaintance which , however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time , is founded , as i hope and believe , on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour . : 12.151967159397506
but , should i have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness . : 10.378566161671728
— no , rejoined the other , i appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and i shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that , though the errand be one of sorrow , this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup . : 9.985511721687619
— then suffer me to take your hand , said he . : 30.259873934649196
the goodness of your heart , i feel sure , will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy , were i to give vent to my feelings , would deprive me even of speech . : 9.17944879931523
and off with him and out trying to walk straight . : 39.83822512019294
boosed at five o ’ clock . : 13.615593992891636
night he was near being lagged only paddy leonard knew the bobby , <NUM> a . : 45.00190331899586
blind to the world up in a shebeen in bride street after closing time , fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard , drinking porter out of teacups . : 11.481058540541316
and calling himself a frenchy for the shawls , joseph manuo , and talking against the catholic religion , and he serving mass in adam and eve ’ s when he was young with his eyes shut , who wrote the new testament , and the old testament , and hugging and smugging . : 13.497602570185938
and the two shawls killed with the laughing , picking his pockets , the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another . : 16.486039631093316
_how is your testament ? : 15.19199014876335
have you got an old testament ? _ only paddy was passing there , i tell you what . : 19.54233335844459
then see him of a sunday with his little concubine of a wife , and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her , no less , and her violets , nice as pie , doing the little lady . : 17.21371173248505
jack mooney ’ s sister . : 34.07159910144851
and the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples . : 17.818891702005548
gob , jack made him toe the line . : 15.888313766281618
told him if he didn ’ t patch up the pot , jesus , he ’ d kick the shite out of him . : 13.842586821152862
so terry brought the three pints . : 30.611229063217184
— here , says joe , doing the honours . : 26.817264044547866
here , citizen . : 54.005197514685996
— _slan leat_ , says he . : 22.77169239432438
— fortune , joe , says i . : 24.19783346257289
good health , citizen . : 35.95929777367925
gob , he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already . : 16.06749824849215
want a small fortune to keep him in drinks . : 22.756418173743292
— who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty , alf ? : 20.602872162982084
— friend of yours , says alf . : 31.932312560508265
— nannan ? : 153.35833594971172
— i won ’ t mention any names , says alf . : 15.751677644177446
— i thought so , says joe . : 28.96457361638666
i saw him up at that meeting now with william field , m . : 16.612613530567213
p ., the cattle traders . : 23.453405357438108
— hairy iopas , says the citizen , that exploded volcano , the darling of all countries and the idol of his own . : 16.37245544466605
so joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue . : 12.062700456585675
because he was up one time in a knacker ’ s yard . : 30.979431254666967
walking about with his book and pencil here ’ s my head and my heels are coming till joe cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier . : 12.251763665601262
mister knowall . : 36.58688982951953
teach your grandmother how to milk ducks . : 13.895181110670848
pisser burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with mrs o ’ dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her . : 10.40414950181921
couldn ’ t loosen her farting strings but old cod ’ s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it . : 7.928457233199445
what ’ s your programme today ? : 27.132930912190584
humane methods . : 33.140719858923646
gob , he ’ d have a soft hand under a hen . : 19.264733360857615
ga ga gara . : 16.212894349473657
klook klook klook . : 18.13289855047591
black liz is our hen . : 20.05885181329315
she lays eggs for us . : 29.12352795028978
when she lays her egg she is so glad . : 17.607532058724917
gara . : 53.92878406661024
then comes good uncle leo . : 21.935472405497816
he puts his hand under black liz and takes her fresh egg . : 15.526969081753467
ga ga ga ga gara . : 9.503425014157012
— anyhow , says joe , field and nannetti are going over tonight to london to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons . : 12.824370898672507
i wanted to see him , as it happens . : 39.080670242558526
— well , he ’ s going off by the mailboat , says joe , tonight . : 20.733737616101426
— that ’ s too bad , says bloom . : 23.069928636042647
i wanted particularly . : 74.372121631302
perhaps only mr field is going . : 19.171852964735276
i couldn ’ t phone . : 42.0144737321894
you ’ re sure ? : 39.90774441956648
— nannan ’ s going too , says joe . : 30.187230780304567
the league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding irish games in the park . : 13.740929808086099
what do you think of that , citizen ? : 34.59299767189001
_the sluagh na h - eireann_ . : 12.148822024425924
mr cowe conacre ( multifarnham . : 18.549551848450403
nat .): arising out of the question of my honourable friend , the member for shillelagh , may i ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition ? : 7.233942788944891
mr allfours ( tamoshant . : 28.46352557137484
con .): honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house . : 10.26033846420192
i feel i cannot usefully add anything to that . : 17.145028046921137
the answer to the honourable member ’ s question is in the affirmative . : 40.20659309156681
mr orelli o ’ reilly ( montenotte . : 20.74873672384455
nat .): have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play irish games in the phoenix park ? : 7.280353186265087
mr allfours : the answer is in the negative . : 36.92663307929798
mr cowe conacre : has the right honourable gentleman ’ s famous mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the treasury bench ? : 9.919722191996616
( o ! : 157.99534813361512
o !) mr allfours : i must have notice of that question . : 22.05662229160311

( ironical opposition cheers .) the speaker : order ! : 11.409684728552271
order ! : 140.41815391469632
( the house rises . : 71.18108705279109
cheers .) — there ’ s the man , says joe , that made the gaelic sports revival . : 15.722331252123292
there he is sitting there . : 34.659193025145115
the man that got away james stephens . : 23.710633909111305
the champion of all ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot . : 16.33192572230675
what was your best throw , citizen ? : 23.01392185475209
— _na bacleis_ , says the citizen , letting on to be modest . : 16.183538595499662
there was a time i was as good as the next fellow anyhow . : 26.49966276909918
— put it there , citizen , says joe . : 33.81195043644706
you were and a bloody sight better . : 36.47707783087606
— is that really a fact ? : 32.554058308527985
— yes , says bloom . : 31.11555195177355
that ’ s well known . : 40.75425610333913
did you not know that ? : 49.16517312034298

no need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces , the acme of art , wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol , a bogoak sceptre , a north american puma ( a far nobler king of beasts than the british article , be it said in passing ), a kerry calf and a golden eagle from carrantuohill . : 8.896745839031102
the scenes depicted on the emunctory field , showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones , are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the barmecides . : 6.92966620676687

did you read that skit in the _united irishman_ today about that zulu chief that ’ s visiting england ? : 11.475235785466701
so the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out : — a delegation of the chief cotton magnates of manchester was presented yesterday to his majesty the alaki of abeakuta by gold stick in waiting , lord walkup of walkup on eggs , to tender to his majesty the heartfelt thanks of british traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions . : 8.615262432964046
the delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate , in the course of a happy speech , freely translated by the british chaplain , the reverend ananias praisegod barebones , tendered his best thanks to massa walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between abeakuta and the british empire , stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible , the volume of the word of god and the secret of england ’ s greatness , graciously presented to him by the white chief woman , the great squaw victoria , with a personal dedication from the august hand of the royal donor . : 9.982258385167038
the alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _black and white_ from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty kakachakachak , surnamed forty warts , after which he visited the chief factory of cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors ’ book , subsequently executing a charming old abeakutic wardance , in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks , amid hilarious applause from the girl hands . : 7.18507819341162

and there ’ s the man now that ’ ll tell you all about it , martin cunningham . : 24.742479319252745
sure enough the castle car drove up with martin on it and jack power with him and a fellow named crofter or crofton , pensioner out of the collector general ’ s , an orangeman blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or crawford gallivanting around the country at the king ’ s expense . : 11.096214224922294

and there came a voice out of heaven , calling : _elijah ! : 23.73450713167375
elijah ! _ and he answered with a main cry : _abba ! : 20.64959015034863
adonai ! _ and they beheld him even him , ben bloom elijah , amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over donohoe ’ s in little green street like a shot off a shovel . : 10.020650888295936
[ <NUM> ] the summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace . : 25.400372289010726
far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand , on the proud promontory of dear old howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay , on the weedgrown rocks along sandymount shore and , last but not least , on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man , mary , star of the sea . : 9.342282707640743
the three girl friends were seated on the rocks , enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly . : 15.731526231738119
many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine , cissy caffrey and edy boardman with the baby in the pushcar and tommy and jacky caffrey , two little curlyheaded boys , dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name _h . : 8.521623791375047
belleisle_ printed on both . : 18.085537550809963
for tommy and jacky caffrey were twins , scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them . : 5.985325227479209
they were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets , building castles as children do , or playing with their big coloured ball , happy as the day was long . : 10.68074966566343
and edy boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight . : 9.064688459287671
he was but eleven months and nine days old and , though still a tiny toddler , was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words . : 12.432757535727582
cissy caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin . : 13.779107305103805
— now , baby , cissy caffrey said . : 24.376180902702334
say out big , big . : 31.888817469648643
i want a drink of water . : 42.11737114742088
and baby prattled after her : — a jink a jink a jawbo . : 14.511194351874089
cissy caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children , so patient with little sufferers and tommy caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was cissy caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on . : 7.816024344132768
what a persuasive power that girl had ! : 17.387666516275825
none of your spoilt beauties , flora macflimsy sort , was cissy caffrey . : 11.269260670684362
a truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life , always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips , a girl lovable in the extreme . : 14.533554804082712
and edy boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother . : 17.81464053639531
boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule . : 11.697981757244136
the apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which master jacky had built and master tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the martello tower had . : 10.236203331544504
but if master tommy was headstrong master jacky was selfwilled too and , true to the maxim that every little irishman ’ s house is his castle , he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and ( alas to relate !) the coveted castle too . : 8.067433764334679
needless to say the cries of discomfited master tommy drew the attention of the girl friends . : 11.675396556929382
— come here , tommy , his sister called imperatively . : 25.107463029164702
at once ! : 139.90722951787936
and you , jacky , for shame to throw poor tommy in the dirty sand . : 22.476984250909826
wait till i catch you for that . : 18.41609760757113
his eyes misty with unshed tears master tommy came at her call for their big sister ’ s word was law with the twins . : 10.941699655142896
and in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure . : 28.65212314506329
his little man - o ’- war top and unmentionables were full of sand but cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life ’ s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit . : 9.049227213247473
still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at master jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn ’ t be far from him , her eyes dancing in admonition . : 9.436510089255167
— nasty bold jacky ! : 39.73484853234202
she put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly : — what ’ s your name ? : 15.04838283975666
— tell us who is your sweetheart , spoke edy boardman . : 22.23690098623525
is cissy your sweetheart ? : 39.614581685884595
— nao , tearful tommy said . : 18.21804931626219
— is edy boardman your sweetheart ? : 27.57742478237019
cissy queried . : 66.21447195488751
— nao , tommy said . : 26.46752700493031
— i know , edy boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes . : 11.002450329948026
i know who is tommy ’ s sweetheart . : 41.0905812125597
— nao , tommy said on the verge of tears . : 21.29968509240288
cissy ’ s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to edy boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn ’ t see and to mind he didn ’ t wet his new tan shoes . : 11.68887515241374
but who was gerty ? : 81.99943536211165
gerty macdowell who was seated near her companions , lost in thought , gazing far away into the distance was , in very truth , as fair a specimen of winsome irish girlhood as one could wish to see . : 9.81286758510585
she was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though , as folks often said , she was more a giltrap than a macdowell . : 12.874870428466282
her figure was slight and graceful , inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the widow welch ’ s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling . : 8.388845031561145
the waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine cupid ’ s bow , greekly perfect . : 9.931938869597127
her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either . : 8.112986376108816
bertha supple told that once to edy boardman , a deliberate lie , when she was black out at daggers drawn with gerty ( the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals ) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she ’ d never speak to her again . : 11.3695504098986
honour where honour is due . : 15.621866557047472
there was an innate refinement , a languid queenly _hauteur_ about gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep . : 8.268468893144927
had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education gerty macdowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her . : 8.256533497008306
mayhap it was this , the love that might have been , that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look , tense with suppressed meaning , that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes , a charm few could resist . : 11.380215177742793
why have women such eyes of witchery ? : 14.660299183848103
gerty ’ s were of the bluest irish blue , set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows . : 11.420680673059348
time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive . : 13.68799448277117
it was madame vera verity , directress of the woman beautiful page of the princess novelette , who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes , so becoming in leaders of fashion , and she had never regretted it . : 10.640619182906553
then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose ? : 12.127800107787314
that would suit mrs dignam because she had a button one . : 18.93641895836019
but gerty ’ s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair . : 15.218646108635046
it was dark brown with a natural wave in it . : 23.249601033551485
she had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too , thursday for wealth . : 8.962892803455588
and just now at edy ’ s words as a telltale flush , delicate as the faintest rosebloom , crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety god ’ s fair land of ireland did not hold her equal . : 10.950191288494418
for an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes . : 17.11828242082354
she was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue . : 15.878317057155195
inclination prompted her to speak out : dignity told her to be silent . : 14.53989120590012
the pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young may morning . : 13.992511994953363
she knew right well , no - one better , what made squinty edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers ’ quarrel . : 12.411328211360196
as per usual somebody ’ s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the london bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window . : 13.549594093305986
only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother w . : 15.665173478084906
wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in trinity college university . : 14.049151415268767
little recked he perhaps for what she felt , that dull aching void in her heart sometimes , piercing to the core . : 11.446945913866163
yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time . : 17.51591127221432
they were protestants in his family and of course gerty knew who came first and after him the blessed virgin and then saint joseph . : 17.565831648593015
but he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked , every inch a gentleman , the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why edy boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn ’ t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden . : 13.958785889009734
gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of dame fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out . : 11.383670126203567
a neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes ( because it was expected in the _lady ’ s pictorial_ that electric blue would be worn ) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket ( in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit ) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection . : 7.914007738263205
she wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone . : 7.193636640851339
all tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at clery ’ s summer sales , the very it , slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice , seven fingers two and a penny . : 10.861588765733218
she did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then , smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her ! : 16.942807116153716
and when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew . : 20.008720182252123
her shoes were the newest thing in footwear ( edy boardman prided herself that she was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like gerty macdowell , a five , and never would ash , oak or elm ) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep . : 7.971092332458127
her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops . : 6.713664846410181
as for undies they were gerty ’ s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen ( though gerty would never see seventeen again ) can find it in his heart to blame her ? : 8.974416793741595
she had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery , three garments and nighties extra , and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons , rosepink , pale blue , mauve and peagreen , and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn ’ t trust those washerwomen as far as she ’ d see them scorching the things . : 6.683299339404521
and yet and yet ! : 74.06079462508065
that strained look on her face ! : 43.62265155015265
a gnawing sorrow is there all the time . : 26.63903509144305
her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where , giving way to tears , she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror . : 12.784658127047265
the paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful . : 12.005192485507623
gerty macdowell yearns in vain . : 15.762530995962319
yes , she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for mrs reggy wylie t . : 11.93710411847839
( because the one who married the elder brother would be mrs wylie ) and in the fashionable intelligence mrs gertrude wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be . : 9.398373339976617
he was too young to understand . : 35.11781415753953
he would not believe in love , a woman ’ s birthright . : 36.128025207738716
the night of the party long ago in stoer ’ s ( he was still in short trousers ) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips . : 14.972290978715135
he called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss ( the first !) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments . : 15.085750174960445
impetuous fellow ! : 29.518288523115118
but waiting , always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over . : 16.240275704456938
it would be like heaven . : 38.64490582257393
for such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve . : 14.488393332934079
with all the heart of her she longs to be his only , his affianced bride for riches for poor , in sickness in health , till death us two part , from this to this day forward . : 12.457603963880127
and while edy boardman was with little tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be . : 13.223348732507443
she would care for him with creature comforts too for gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess . : 8.495956841675966
her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen ann ’ s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire , dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction , then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn ’ t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn ’ t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa giltrap ’ s lovely dog garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in clery ’ s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses . : 6.64637563364614
he would be tall with broad shoulders ( she had always admired tall men for a husband ) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon ( three wonderful weeks !) and then , when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house , every morning they would both have brekky , simple but perfectly served , for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes . : 8.577167504287218
edy boardman asked tommy caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with jacky and to be good now and not to fight . : 14.51268381525014
but tommy said he wanted the ball and edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there ’ d be wigs on the green but tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground , if you please . : 15.457781263895912
the temper of him ! : 104.39135601960746
o , he was a man already was little tommy caffrey since he was out of pinnies . : 18.442179939120532
edy told him no , no and to be off now with him and she told cissy caffrey not to give in to him . : 21.712682600712014
— you ’ re not my sister , naughty tommy said . : 15.455515935739793
it ’ s my ball . : 37.01422750238533
but cissy caffrey told baby boardman to look up , look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and tommy after it in full career , having won the day . : 13.035585932953426
— anything for a quiet life , laughed ciss . : 33.95481192273452
and she tickled tiny tot ’ s two cheeks to make him forget and played here ’ s the lord mayor , here ’ s his two horses , here ’ s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in , chinchopper , chinchopper , chinchopper chin . : 10.084148370316127
but edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him . : 10.319321831793129
— i ’ d like to give him something , she said , so i would , where i won ’ t say . : 18.395148493323006
gerty macdowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she ’ d be ashamed of her life to say , flushing a deep rosy red , and edy boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said . : 9.427870203995381
but not a pin cared ciss . : 31.57971632699114
she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose . : 22.16099812179136
give it to him too on the same place as quick as i ’ d look at him . : 21.899154104348835
madcap ciss with her golliwog curls . : 11.915254193274972
you had to laugh at her sometimes . : 34.683234296903024
for instance when she asked you would you have some more chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men ’ s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the miss white . : 11.534708090277134
that was just like cissycums . : 43.90111950609075
o , and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father ’ s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down tritonville road , smoking a cigarette . : 14.911195166230979
there was none to come up to her for fun . : 27.82834749234204
but she was sincerity itself , one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made , not one of your twofaced things , too sweet to be wholesome . : 12.875278397336977
and then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ . : 23.297803257997476
it was the men ’ s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner , the reverend john hughes s . : 17.465003956961496
j ., rosary , sermon and benediction of the most blessed sacrament . : 11.868358193321619
they were there gathered together without distinction of social class ( and a most edifying spectacle it was to see ) in that simple fane beside the waves , after the storms of this weary world , kneeling before the feet of the immaculate , reciting the litany of our lady of loreto , beseeching her to intercede for them , the old familiar words , holy mary , holy virgin of virgins . : 9.558840469662302
had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink , by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in pearson ’ s weekly , she might now be rolling in her carriage , second to none . : 9.428897486292344
over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket , thinking . : 11.089586229778902
but that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days . : 6.653553119589932
nay , she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father , a prey to the fumes of intoxication , forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness , deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low . : 12.910918154794048
and still the voices sang in supplication to the virgin most powerful , virgin most merciful . : 12.603893144487412
and gerty , rapt in thought , scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off sandymount green that cissy caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk . : 9.24591115269481
you never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face ( it was a palpable case of doctor fell ) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose . : 13.513107451239625
poor father ! : 90.65774120977255
with all his faults she loved him still when he sang _tell me , mary , how to woo thee_ or _my love and cottage near rochelle_ and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with lazenby ’ s salad dressing for supper and when he sang _the moon hath raised_ with mr dignam that died suddenly and was buried , god have mercy on him , from a stroke . : 8.015143407742581
her mother ’ s birthday that was and charley was home on his holidays and tom and mr dignam and mrs and patsy and freddy dignam and they were to have had a group taken . : 13.637925626027355
no - one would have thought the end was so near . : 19.608628376877203
now he was laid to rest . : 37.33971657755254
and her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn ’ t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about catesby ’ s cork lino , artistic , standard designs , fit for a palace , gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home . : 11.58057431600163
a sterling good daughter was gerty just like a second mother in the house , a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold . : 14.183193139058584
and when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but gerty though she didn ’ t like her mother ’ s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about , taking snuff . : 8.27261293957633
everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways . : 28.517765440819986
it was gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime mr tunney the grocer ’ s christmas almanac , the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window . : 8.634865126335981
you could see there was a story behind it . : 29.769338852122793
the colours were done something lovely . : 24.7375452193212
she was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat . : 18.82335589940484
she often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in walker ’ s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant . : 9.942605869685513
the twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last master jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks . : 8.728834847163528
needless to say poor tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball . : 7.507988403583309
our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble cissy caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please . : 10.726367430842874
the gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards cissy caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under gerty ’ s skirt near the little pool by the rock . : 13.213059613042878
the twins clamoured again for it and cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn ’ t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and edy and cissy laughed . : 11.115938168403114
— if you fail try again , edy boardman said . : 20.79966706340127
gerty smiled assent and bit her lip . : 10.420351473815114
a delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle . : 9.765430202019513
pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking . : 13.440659129888788
she felt the warm flush , a danger signal always with gerty macdowell , surging and flaming into her cheeks . : 10.660710904902798
till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight , wan and strangely drawn , seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen . : 11.272064583208028
through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin , spiritual vessel , pray for us , honourable vessel , pray for us , vessel of singular devotion , pray for us , mystical rose . : 7.554895892378584
and careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered , their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father father hughes had told them what the great saint bernard said in his famous prayer of mary , the most pious virgin ’ s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her . : 8.91128708070028
the twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers . : 8.70035227479751
cissy caffrey played with baby boardman till he crowed with glee , clapping baby hands in air . : 7.44220935670583
peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and edy asked where was cissy gone and then cissy popped up her head and cried ah ! : 12.028027734479481
and , my word , didn ’ t the little chap enjoy that ! : 23.898171958668783
and then she told him to say papa . : 48.24411874511485
— say papa , baby . : 36.84666772423686
say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa . : 10.787624392308663
and baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health , a perfect little bunch of love , and he would certainly turn out to be something great , they said . : 13.317201477565742
— haja ja ja haja . : 23.681131268501932
cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out , holy saint denis , that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him . : 8.85888559219936
and two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks . : 12.509874638689736
it was all no use soothering him with no , nono , baby , no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but ciss , always readywitted , gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased . : 10.852615692269524
gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves , no hour to be out , and the little brats of twins . : 14.237309213160549
she gazed out towards the distant sea . : 28.58804695911461
and while she gazed her heart went pitapat . : 19.95976528276037
yes , it was her he was looking at , and there was meaning in his look . : 27.969169117931024
his eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through , read her very soul . : 10.81433028617997
wonderful eyes they were , superbly expressive , but could you trust them ? : 13.089328712507008
people were so queer . : 33.272991851803226
she could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner , the image of the photo she had of martin harvey , the matinee idol , only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn ’ t stagestruck like winny rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he was sitting . : 11.606953379847365
he was in deep mourning , she could see that , and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face . : 21.436327292560886
she would have given worlds to know what it was . : 27.430034282605966
he was looking up so intently , so still , and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down . : 14.350437161535613
she was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking reggy wylie might be out but that was far away . : 14.937426289339548
here was that of which she had so often dreamed . : 32.394762156951614
it was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no - one else . : 15.838485141918932
the very heart of the girlwoman went out to him , her dreamhusband , because she knew on the instant it was him . : 23.80806904194581
if he had suffered , more sinned against than sinning , or even , even , if he had been himself a sinner , a wicked man , she cared not . : 14.554006450307213
even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her . : 11.028034182338772
there were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm . : 11.833687674923496
she was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known , those cyclists showing off what they hadn ’ t got and she just yearned to know all , to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her , make him forget the memory of the past . : 11.074245019018292
then mayhap he would embrace her gently , like a real man , crushing her soft body to him , and love her , his ownest girlie , for herself alone . : 13.900607427593457
refuge of sinners . : 19.47271766751284
comfortress of the afflicted . : 40.66089282005356
well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away : and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart . : 8.687823653897096
gerty could picture the whole scene in the church , the stained glass windows lighted up , the candles , the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed virgin ’ s sodality and father conroy was helping canon o ’ hanlon at the altar , carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down . : 14.627086841768488
he looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of saint dominic . : 11.267532338336629
he told her that time when she told him about that in confession , crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see , not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature ’ s laws , he said , in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by god , he said , and that our blessed lady herself said to the archangel gabriel be it done unto me according to thy word . : 13.325666686164013
he was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours ’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of dublin or some place . : 10.575977080781056
the exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it . : 12.76865969976081
little monkeys common as ditchwater . : 20.443458816655987
someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places , the both of them . : 18.965016559496267
and cissy and edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned . : 16.682273437441758
— jacky ! : 164.630113703826
tommy ! : 177.96947902551528
not they ! : 135.0511221652864
what a great notion they had ! : 37.386606726301444
so cissy said it was the very last time she ’ d ever bring them out . : 19.94759501788891
she jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him , tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn ’ t get it to grow long because it wasn ’ t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it . : 13.148424701879126
she ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn ’ t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about cissy caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible . : 12.367945049454416
it would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked french heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble . : 10.098610398875682
_tableau ! _ that would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness . : 18.74302663042851
queen of angels , queen of patriarchs , queen of prophets , of all saints , they prayed , queen of the most holy rosary and then father conroy handed the thurible to canon o ’ hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the blessed sacrament and cissy caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn ’ t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then canon o ’ hanlon handed the thurible back to father conroy and knelt down looking up at the blessed sacrament and the choir began to sing the _tantum ergo_ and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the _tantumer gosa cramen tum_ . : 9.90466426052759
three and eleven she paid for those stockings in sparrow ’ s of george ’ s street on the tuesday , no the monday before easter and there wasn ’ t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at , transparent , and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form ( the cheek of her !) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself . : 11.830876298132981
cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature . : 12.17149041068899
gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier , a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl ’ s shoulders — a radiant little vision , in sooth , almost maddening in its sweetness . : 10.501666219635398
you would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that . : 14.727514266543965
she could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve . : 11.338950653147663
she put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes . : 10.819199290785729
he was eying her as a snake eyes its prey . : 18.1113007630155
her woman ’ s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose . : 12.672111309163768
edy boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at gerty , half smiling , with her specs like an old maid , pretending to nurse the baby . : 9.220997748485958
irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no - one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers . : 11.527795216378287
and she said to gerty : — a penny for your thoughts . : 33.26713434400178
replied gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth . : 15.733931473078739
i was only wondering was it late . : 28.29312278121733
because she wished to goodness they ’ d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late . : 11.175110296646599
and when cissy came up edy asked her the time and miss cissy , as glib as you like , said it was half past kissing time , time to kiss again . : 15.78591190848198
but edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early . : 24.324735553351616
— wait , said cissy , i ’ ll run ask my uncle peter over there what ’ s the time by his conundrum . : 15.413731994366719
so over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket , getting nervous , and beginning to play with his watchchain , looking up at the church . : 17.408086925418672
passionate nature though he was gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself . : 13.895123452230342
one moment he had been there , fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze , and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman , selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure . : 13.796430740464531
cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and gerty could see him taking out his watch , listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set . : 11.767247470853063
his voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones . : 16.477300699054975
cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order . : 12.324789329913976
then they sang the second verse of the _tantum ergo_ and canon o ’ hanlon got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and he told father conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and father conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time . : 12.676966576047938
it was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets . : 17.808860701888925
his dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour , literally worshipping at her shrine . : 11.490050712981496
if ever there was undisguised admiration in a man ’ s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man ’ s face . : 16.950457409075042
it is for you , gertrude macdowell , and you know it . : 31.727031654132983
edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and cissy took off the twins ’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and canon o ’ hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and father conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out _panem de coelo praestitisti eis_ and edy and cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over . : 9.330535489018896
gerty winced sharply . : 30.493348127661328
a brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable . : 12.484734556882888
it hurt — o yes , it cut deep because edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was . : 11.232073976635123
gerty ’ s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat , so slim , so flawless , so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of . : 8.12265231121726
she had loved him better than he knew . : 25.75856118191234
lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears . : 12.055828782829114
their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see . : 10.515048487401815
— o , responded gerty , quick as lightning , laughing , and the proud head flashed up . : 14.309314520476049
i can throw my cap at who i like because it ’ s leap year . : 14.306416430159054
her words rang out crystalclear , more musical than the cooing of the ringdove , but they cut the silence icily . : 11.986311387998851
there was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with . : 20.291396220123865
as for mr reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces . : 10.831948582825273
and if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot . : 12.535796879619742
miss puny little edy ’ s countenance fell to no slight extent and gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it , the little kinnatt , because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof , apart , in another sphere , that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it . : 10.59521296674772
edy straightened up baby boardman to get ready to go and cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for master boardman junior . : 11.374330044063013
and cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky , laughing up out of his gleeful eyes , and cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby , without as much as by your leave , sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib . : 10.424169115213786
— o my ! : 80.00632271216581
puddeny pie ! : 24.297407089025196
protested ciss . : 27.118077468472876
he has his bib destroyed . : 32.06057125479662
the slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights . : 9.666033427571797
gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because canon o ’ hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that father conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the blessed sacrament in his hands . : 9.711933656379365
how moving the scene there in the gathering twilight , the last glimpse of erin , the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk , hither , thither , with a tiny lost cry . : 11.313846828864351
for gerty had her dreams that no - one knew of . : 15.952086522460876
she loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from bertha supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which , though it did not err on the side of luxury , was scrupulously neat and clean . : 9.933907785839876
it was there she kept her girlish treasure trove , the tortoiseshell combs , her child of mary badge , the whiterose scent , the eyebrowleine , her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in hely ’ s of dame street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs . : 9.64599094062265
_art thou real , my ideal ? _ it was called by louis j walsh , magherafelt , and after there was something about _twilight , wilt thou ever ? _ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry , so sad in its transient loveliness , had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her , one by one , and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it . : 8.25247090811048
but it must end , she felt . : 40.96897255884095
if she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her . : 14.815687945985998
love laughs at locksmiths . : 24.574067023794715
she would make the great sacrifice . : 41.930370327364614
her every effort would be to share his thoughts . : 19.44926559484152
dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness . : 11.615194621511023
there was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse , cruel only to be kind . : 13.19639326315596
but even if — what then ? : 37.72630686956598
would it make a very great difference ? : 27.13380349368793
from everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled . : 13.795168376501206
she loathed that sort of person , the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl ’ s honour , degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station . : 11.0829018994716
no , no : not that . : 37.87872320980434
they would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of society with a big ess . : 14.427544463077101
perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall . : 19.50759089582096
she thought she understood . : 47.44312629159814
she would try to understand him because men were so different . : 17.16478598729078
the old love was waiting , waiting with little white hands stretched out , with blue appealing eyes . : 14.154447324826668
heart of mine ! : 64.30845985962654
she would follow , her dream of love , the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all , the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide . : 23.741156292213677
nothing else mattered . : 36.48762660570603
come what might she would be wild , untrammelled , free . : 15.003185332269583
canon o ’ hanlon put the blessed sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang _laudate dominum omnes gentes_ and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and father conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat edy asked wasn ’ t she coming but jacky caffrey called out : — o , look , cissy ! : 8.329348323992615
and they all looked was it sheet lightning but tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church , blue and then green and purple . : 14.515451948894748
— it ’ s fireworks , cissy caffrey said . : 19.943333351973287
and they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church , helterskelter , edy with the pushcar with baby boardman in it and cissy holding tommy and jacky by the hand so they wouldn ’ t fall running . : 13.401341843485104
but gerty was adamant . : 36.60437786368295
she had no intention of being at their beck and call . : 14.376891294409443
if they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was . : 14.618096198680623
the eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling . : 14.544201039219253
she looked at him a moment , meeting his glance , and a light broke in upon her . : 20.90829265068276
whitehot passion was in that face , passion silent as the grave , and it had made her his . : 18.703450907531604
at last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death , steadfast , a sterling man , a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips . : 13.476507834797294
his hands and face were working and a tremour went over her . : 16.965168365572357
but this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips . : 16.646604746417808
besides there was absolution so long as you didn ’ t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and cissy caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too , my dear , and winny rippingham so mad about actors ’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did . : 11.016051576198805
and jacky caffrey shouted to look , there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look , look , there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air , a soft thing , to and fro , dark . : 13.169757349904938
and she saw a long roman candle going up over the trees , up , up , and , in the tense hush , they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it , high , high , almost out of sight , and her face was suffused with a divine , an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too , nainsook knickers , the fabric that caresses the skin , better than those other pettiwidth , the green , four and eleven , on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no - one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn ’ t ashamed and he wasn ’ t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn ’ t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking , looking . : 10.656239083253487
she would fain have cried to him chokingly , held out her snowy slender arms to him to come , to feel his lips laid on her white brow , the cry of a young girl ’ s love , a little strangled cry , wrung from her , that cry that has rung through the ages . : 14.82304890887803
and then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and o ! : 11.504058672168563
then the roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of o ! : 19.872228493841053
and everyone cried o ! : 47.88875141000148
in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah ! : 13.932198006272309
they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden , o so lovely , o , soft , sweet , soft ! : 10.231952905504839
then all melted away dewily in the grey air : all was silent . : 17.617586444580546
she glanced at him as she bent forward quickly , a pathetic little glance of piteous protest , of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl . : 13.043822254116744
he was leaning back against the rock behind . : 27.836390080794967
leopold bloom ( for it is he ) stands silent , with bowed head before those young guileless eyes . : 12.365633080611214
what a brute he had been ! : 37.21372754836243
at it again ? : 85.41718963484512
a fair unsullied soul had called to him and , wretch that he was , how had he answered ? : 20.735774581724783
an utter cad he had been ! : 30.185299048360378
he of all men ! : 127.48364616484923
but there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes , for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered . : 14.347538191292612
should a girl tell ? : 40.155243840660404
no , a thousand times no . : 38.74261938517229
that was their secret , only theirs , alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don ’ t tell . : 10.107950742691107
cissy caffrey whistled , imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was : and then she cried : — gerty ! : 15.266207047390864
gerty ! : 166.55732005240037
we ’ re going . : 38.92767633081141
we can see from farther up . : 28.89112756429213
gerty had an idea , one of love ’ s little ruses . : 25.301997666327306
she slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back . : 12.33071671894002
wonder if he ’ s too far to . : 29.79630362931293
she rose . : 135.89568237078242
was it goodbye ? : 71.53653391663204
she had to go but they would meet again , there , and she would dream of that till then , tomorrow , of her dream of yester eve . : 22.46514657052803
she drew herself up to her full height . : 28.54095431890137
their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart , full of a strange shining , hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face . : 13.126671424298152
she half smiled at him wanly , a sweet forgiving smile , a smile that verged on tears , and then they parted . : 15.448363807363167
slowly , without looking back she went down the uneven strand to cissy , to edy to jacky and tommy caffrey , to little baby boardman . : 12.298290350894233
it was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed . : 14.127747097839862
she walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because — because gerty macdowell was ... : 13.752737921517635
she ’ s lame ! : 61.87682563717125
mr bloom watched her as she limped away . : 18.906343510831647
poor girl ! : 90.35758090909722
that ’ s why she ’ s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint . : 22.451202281477485
thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib . : 21.602715668804382
jilted beauty . : 28.89430323413825

then ask in the morning : was i drunk last night ? : 21.72266273401909
bad policy however to fault the husband . : 13.18688056905955
chickens come home to roost . : 16.81086652644221
they stick by one another like glue . : 24.658584513740006
maybe the women ’ s fault also . : 23.080614425567855
that ’ s where molly can knock spots off them . : 13.208234833374418
it ’ s the blood of the south . : 35.37382135264531

also the form , the figure . : 54.83714013805172
just compare for instance those others . : 20.866781799512435
wife locked up at home , skeleton in the cupboard . : 24.753846586812205

always see a fellow ’ s weak point in his wife . : 28.727312869790023

have their own secrets between them . : 27.431178059884807
chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn ’ t take them in hand . : 15.883253289361667
then little chits of girls , height of a shilling in coppers , with little hubbies . : 14.96016235869385
as god made them he matched them . : 19.51781793129096

cat ’ s away , the mice will play . : 31.26303733010064
i remember looking in pill lane . : 24.53213188835913
also that now is magnetism . : 24.968932922101096
back of everything magnetism . : 29.732003525750557
earth for instance pulling this and being pulled . : 15.978864495677614
that causes movement . : 71.16663009494809
and time , well that ’ s the time the movement takes . : 29.41543376358788
then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit . : 11.68303308476827
because it ’ s all arranged . : 30.175611480710796

more put out about a hole in her stocking . : 28.915625228006835
molly , her underjaw stuck out , head back , about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show . : 17.063837209055592
and when the painters were in lombard street west . : 17.55571650367921
fine voice that fellow had . : 30.030334395606868
how giuglini began . : 42.595127771268366

it was too . : 70.25130081721683
violets . : 81.87650596588011
came from the turpentine probably in the paint . : 27.33629026628702
make their own use of everything . : 32.38144286611495
same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn ’ t hear . : 11.192819248968505
but lots of them can ’ t kick the beam , i think . : 19.41627531881379
keep that thing up for hours . : 25.348333438036356
kind of a general all round over me and half down my back . : 16.42573212578053
that ’ s her perfume . : 40.44015340663825
why she waved her hand . : 26.20978050443356
i leave you this to think of me when i ’ m far away on the pillow . : 20.007226976362837
heliotrope ? : 67.94492493637387
hyacinth ? : 67.94492493637387

she ’ d like scent of that kind . : 29.424838872313778
sweet and cheap : soon sour . : 15.06281001756759
why molly likes opoponax . : 25.53728090128749
suits her , with a little jessamine mixed . : 25.467818880194027
her high notes and her low notes . : 25.92987951806433
at the dance night she met him , dance of the hours . : 25.12689732220575
heat brought it out . : 34.95467714945979
she was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before . : 30.547358994377294
good conductor , is it ? : 32.1344319855641
or bad ? : 138.91599326352056
light too . : 74.8611115666139
suppose there ’ s some connection . : 32.445531567673505
for instance if you go into a cellar where it ’ s dark . : 25.856611722233904
mysterious thing too . : 21.81768895420667
why did i smell it only now ? : 21.346726934912613
took its time in coming like herself , slow but sure . : 9.935628163508463

all she there told him , ruing death for friend so young , algate sore unwilling god ’ s rightwiseness to withsay . : 8.925736979937456
she said that he had a fair sweet death through god his goodness with masspriest to be shriven , holy housel and sick men ’ s oil to his limbs . : 10.312312861840203
the man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in mona island through bellycrab three year agone come childermas and she prayed to god the allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness . : 9.085066616502097
he heard her sad words , in held hat sad staring . : 18.088992973218534
so stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other . : 9.638681797798029
therefore , everyman , look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother ’ s womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came . : 11.938898874763197
the man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed . : 22.5003759593446
the nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be . : 16.024527768479608
she said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman ’ s birth . : 13.311860762569978
then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house . : 16.180310987559867
the man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women ’ s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid . : 13.540676461759505
nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless . : 10.094643773954818
and whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat . : 11.067277537207488
and there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept dixon . : 20.923275168390727
and the traveller leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice . : 7.942433023880779
and he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there . : 22.274757536825582
and the traveller leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile . : 15.29416532885662
also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility . : 10.111004542497295
but the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle . : 10.077478162927175
and the traveller leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery . : 7.248449178863512
and in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment . : 10.87393427787588
and on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously . : 8.70523974672666
and there were vessels that are wrought by magic of mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles . : 14.673166657466641
and full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer . : 8.750113576130847
and there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so . : 7.613157247921084
and these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress . : 12.011888232016561
and also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain . : 10.675290146879263
and they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead . : 10.842028776708956
and the learning knight let pour for childe leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each . : 6.742038686605675
and childe leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile . : 8.48985448593734
and he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile . : 20.76688126579429
thanked be almighty god . : 15.033076013462988
this meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of jesu our alther liege lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child , a gentle dame , whose time hied fast . : 7.540666872761822
sir leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and i marvel , said he , that it be not come or now . : 12.46536850016337
meseems it dureth overlong . : 9.634773585385695
and he was ware and saw a franklin that hight lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently . : 11.585360435369271
but , said he , or it be long too she will bring forth by god his bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long . : 10.246327338566653
and the franklin that had drunken said , expecting each moment to be her next . : 18.807925071205254
also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and , now drink , said he , fully delectably , and he quaffed as far as he might to their both ’ s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness . : 13.12935382205247
and sir leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars ’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup . : 9.187168993587498
woman ’ s woe with wonder pondering . : 20.289856475777697
now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might . : 22.23739476751765
there was a sort of scholars along either side the board , that is to wit , dixon yclept junior of saint mary merciable ’ s with other his fellows lynch and madden , scholars of medicine , and the franklin that hight lenehan and one from alba longa , one crotthers , and young stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and costello that men clepen punch costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested ( and of all them , reserved young stephen , he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead ) and beside the meek sir leopold . : 8.766758914166479
but on young malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow . : 13.159495816787825
and sir leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir simon and to this his son young stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner . : 11.27713034057792
ruth red him , love led on with will to wander , loth to leave . : 10.581919560862772
for they were right witty scholars . : 32.09821819763599
and he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness , young madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die ( for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of eblana in horne ’ s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case ). : 7.949847916944706
and they said farther she should live because in the beginning , they said , the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die . : 11.1752906771888
and not few and of these was young lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy . : 8.564345928405926
a redress god grant . : 47.0242074532137
this was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay , by our virgin mother , the wife should live and the babe to die . : 12.907433909868057
in colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack . : 7.477555916247087
then young madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to saint ultan of arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved . : 7.831039655677118
to whom young stephen had these words following : murmur , sirs , is eke oft among lay folk . : 9.20413862632463
both babe and parent now glorify their maker , the one in limbo gloom , the other in purgefire . : 11.522984930801641
but , gramercy , what of those godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise , which is the sin against the holy ghost , very god , lord and giver of life ? : 12.562919598293892
for , sirs , he said , our lust is brief . : 19.887379613312188
we are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we . : 7.748730378192735
then said dixon junior to punch costello wist he what ends . : 9.110858945453877
but he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead . : 12.523004011000992
whereat crotthers of alba longa sang young malachi ’ s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn , the other all this while , pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him , witnessing all and several by saint foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do . : 7.762433620795508
thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young stephen and sir leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever . : 8.517286462232478
then spake young stephen orgulous of mother church that would cast him out of her bosom , of law of canons , of lilith , patron of abortions , of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or , as virgilius saith , by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with , _effectu secuto_ , or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of averroes and moses maimonides . : 7.713445272877664
he said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for god ’ s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman ’ s seal , even that blessed peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded . : 6.973549180632664
all they bachelors then asked of sir leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life . : 7.796155487233612
a wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and , laying hand to jaw , he said dissembling , as his wont was , that as it was informed him , who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman , and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions . : 9.407273582907221
that is truth , pardy , said dixon , and , or i err , a pregnant word . : 21.540233330328036
but sir leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny . : 7.886257931455282
and she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb ’ s wool , the flower of the flock , lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled ( for it was then about the midst of the winter ) and now sir leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend ’ s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage ( for all accounted him of real parts ) so grieved he also in no less measure for young stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores . : 9.612409596669146
about that present time young stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who , praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff , he gave them for a pledge the vicar of christ which also as he said is vicar of bray . : 7.40262812845223
now drink we , quod he , of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul ’ s bodiment . : 11.84979210787181
leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone . : 11.700980847735481
be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay . : 12.283655820965157
see ye here . : 50.17569498826292
and he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had , he said , for a song which he writ . : 12.362731562476014
they all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore . : 10.477731205628267
his words were then these as followeth : know all men , he said , time ’ s ruins build eternity ’ s mansions . : 13.367152829707823
what means this ? : 60.74386153221796
desire ’ s wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time . : 10.3197226287438
mark me now . : 32.594896051282184
in woman ’ s womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away . : 11.674148435386813
this is the postcreation . : 42.3196028435169
no question but her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our agenbuyer , healer and herd , our mighty mother and mother most venerable and bernardus saith aptly that she hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem_ , that is to wit , an almightiness of petition because she is the second eve and she won us , saith augustine too , whereas that other , our grandam , which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all , seed , breed and generation , for a penny pippin . : 7.2068204132052145
but here is the matter now . : 45.04080243581116
or she knew him , that second i say , and was but creature of her creature , _vergine madre , figlia di tuo figlio_ , or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with peter piscator who lives in the house that jack built and with joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages , _parceque m . : 9.19971741318404

entweder_ transubstantiality _oder_ consubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality . : 7.105126055713882
and all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word . : 22.43327529488973
a pregnancy without joy , he said , a birth without pangs , a body without blemish , a belly without bigness . : 15.273980151424457

with will will we withstand , withsay . : 17.98809661437515
hereupon punch costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch _staboo stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in almany which he did straightways now attack : _the first three months she was not well , staboo , _ when here nurse quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard . : 6.658952847766684
it was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking , in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage , nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently punch costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him , a murrain seize the dolt , what a devil he would be at , thou chuff , thou puny , thou got in peasestraw , thou losel , thou chitterling , thou spawn of a rebel , thou dykedropt , thou abortion thou , to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of god ape , the good sir leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet , margerain gentle , advising also the time ’ s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred . : 7.54185440849881
in horne ’ s house rest should reign . : 22.89022054454563
to be short this passage was scarce by when master dixon of mary in eccles , goodly grinning , asked young stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar ’ s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb , chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days . : 8.78192028388596
master lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how , as he heard hereof counted , he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too , waxing merry and toasting to his fathership . : 9.216535898451614
but he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin . : 14.593995866154756
thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses , as the priests use in madagascar island , she to be in guise of white and saffron , her groom in white and grain , with burning of nard and tapers , on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was there unmaided . : 7.064124739973063
he gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets master john fletcher and master francis beaumont that is in their _maid ’ s tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers : _to bed , to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals . : 9.296115099808473
an exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion . : 5.958344978828498
well met they were , said master dixon , joyed , but , harkee , young sir , better were they named beau mount and lecher for , by my troth , of such a mingling much might come . : 10.043320734204043
young stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it . : 12.049584088978492
greater love than this , he said , no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend . : 15.025148822047292

remember , erin , thy generations and thy days of old , how thou settedst little by me and by my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication in my sight and to wax fat and kick like jeshurum . : 8.271302607174503
therefore hast thou sinned against my light and hast made me , thy lord , to be the slave of servants . : 12.307986441768785

and he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm . : 9.96914524171148
then did some mock and some jeer and punch costello fell hard again to his yale which master lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour . : 10.032701268380873

he drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that master madden , being godly certain whiles , knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and master bloom , at the braggart ’ s side , spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear , advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard , the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead , look you , having taken place , and all of the order of a natural phenomenon . : 11.298128632939823
but was young boasthard ’ s fear vanquished by calmer ’ s words ? : 19.072620824471954

he was neither as much as he would have liked to be either . : 26.784932863804002
but could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle holiness that then he lived withal ? : 14.696180017263398
indeed no for grace was not there to find that bottle . : 17.71168006091955
heard he then in that clap the voice of the god bringforth or , what calmer said , a hubbub of phenomenon ? : 17.657989861615075
heard ? : 211.50805376801517
why , he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube understanding ( which he had not done ). : 17.023474708983894
for through that tube he saw that he was in the land of phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show . : 15.360757878854457
and would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away ? : 20.964861914072095
by no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book law . : 10.007004635522094
then wotted he nought of that other land which is called believe - on - me , that is the land of promise which behoves to the king delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it ? : 8.685048416853288
yes , pious had told him of that land and chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name , she said , is bird - in - the - hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as , ho , you pretty man , turn aside hither and i will show you a brave place , and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named two - in - the - bush or , by some learned , carnal concupiscence . : 11.353995535853478
for regarding believe - on - me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for , first , two - in - the - bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them , pickaback and topsyturvy and shameface and cheek by jowl and , second , for that foul plague allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and , third , that they might take no hurt neither from offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named killchild . : 8.157446769787995

bloom there for a languor he had but was now better , he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame mrs moll with red slippers on in a pair of turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and mistress purefoy there , that got in through pleading her belly , and now on the stools , poor body , two days past her term , the midwives sore put to it and can ’ t deliver , she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks , they say , but god give her soon issue . : 10.900586623449863

with this came up lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night ’ s gazette and he made a show to find it about him ( for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it ) but on stephen ’ s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk . : 13.351871625575585
he was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women , horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat . : 8.873619709965704
to tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps , ostlers , bookies , paul ’ s men , runners , flatcaps , waistcoateers , ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip . : 7.181191471829052
he took his ordinary at a boilingcook ’ s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue , some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother ’ s son of them would burst their sides . : 10.683493127431655

there ’ s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset . : 11.848361249224451
_mort aux vaches_ , says frank then in the french language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in bordeaux and he spoke french like a gentleman too . : 10.442452170349412
from a child this frank had been a donought that his father , a headborough , who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes , matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes . : 11.64321027253023
one time he would be a playactor , then a sutler or a welsher , then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main , then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk , kidnapping a squire ’ s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids ’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge . : 9.307995285296617
he had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him . : 9.230637600639758

and he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers , greasy hoggets and wether wool , having been some years before actuary for mr joseph cuffe , a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by mr gavin low ’ s yard in prussia street . : 7.246826697556361

mr stephen , a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor ’ s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality , that was sending over doctor rinderpest , the bestquoted cowcatcher in all muscovy , with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns . : 11.708155206289907
come , come , says mr vincent , plain dealing . : 17.921518834727987
he ’ ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that ’ s irish , says he . : 20.10202344393838
irish by name and irish by nature , says mr stephen , and he sent the ale purling about , an irish bull in an english chinashop . : 13.168169689552101
i conceive you , says mr dixon . : 35.51409895120592
it is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer nicholas , the bravest cattlebreeder of them all , with an emerald ring in his nose . : 16.372902725687908
true for you , says mr vincent cross the table , and a bullseye into the bargain , says he , and a plumper and a portlier bull , says he , never shit on shamrock . : 13.05137216427046
he had horns galore , a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island , leaving doughballs and rollingpins , followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains . : 10.418053024793771
what for that , says mr dixon , but before he came over farmer nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself . : 11.151274324000822
so be off now , says he , and do all my cousin german the lord harry tells you and take a farmer ’ s blessing , and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly . : 15.185146404026408
but the slap and the blessing stood him friend , says mr vincent , for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid , wife , abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all ireland . : 11.755861377279768
another then put in his word : and they dressed him , says he , in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart ’ s content . : 11.52119856697754
by this time the father of the faithful ( for so they called him ) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture . : 13.317179300952773
to remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls ’ language and they all after him . : 7.946790509256416
ay , says another , and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself ( for that was the only colour to his mind ) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice , saying : by the lord harry , green is the grass that grows on the ground . : 14.878624950541662
and , says mr dixon , if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in roscommon or the wilds of connemara or a husbandman in sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he ’ d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord harry ’ s orders . : 9.608109650818102
there was bad blood between them at first , says mr vincent , and the lord harry called farmer nicholas all the old nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and i ’ ll meddle in his matters , says he . : 13.166050854477746
i ’ ll make that animal smell hell , says he , with the help of that good pizzle my father left me . : 12.537311299168817
after that , says mr vincent , the lord harry put his head into a cow ’ s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name . : 16.836406753379862
then , with the water running off him , he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls ’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy , the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat . : 10.806810000413815
in short , he and the bull of ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt . : 19.115262448547018
which was the occasion , says mr vincent , of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty : _ — pope peter ’ s but a pissabed . : 16.55382812654018
a man ’ s a man for a ’ that . _ our worthy acquaintance mr malachi mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered , a young gentleman , his name alec bannon , who had late come to town , it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars . : 11.888279521579685
mr mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on . : 16.443407478544415
whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at mr quinnell ’ s bearing a legend printed in fair italics : _mr malachi mulligan . : 7.701519445576954
fertiliser and incubator . : 14.1139330891604
lambay island_ . : 25.872697232576
his project , as he went on to expound , was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir fopling popinjay and sir milksop quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed . : 9.220361708077052
well , let us hear of it , good my friend , said mr dixon . : 20.10337117830827
i make no doubt it smacks of wenching . : 15.718965275506514
come , be seated , both . : 27.241402109908748
’ tis as cheap sitting as standing . : 16.50195095042724
mr mulligan accepted of the invitation and , expatiating upon his design , told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility , both the inhibitory and the prohibitory , whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired . : 8.081205134104328
it grieved him plaguily , he said , to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges : and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures , a prey to the vilest bonzes , who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness , sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress , this , he assured them , made his heart weep . : 7.505973486559114
to curb this inconvenient ( which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat ), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter , he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of lambay island from its holder , lord talbot de malahide , a tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party . : 5.693172345332068
he proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named _omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural . : 8.231887272066084
money was no object , he said , nor would he take a penny for his pains . : 19.30633806064308
the poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion , if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions , would find in him their man . : 8.38933179444179
for his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there , the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose , both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies . : 6.799823606397707
after this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration mr mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it . : 10.373683475971616
they both , it seems , had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water , as might be observed by mr mulligan ’ s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald . : 13.438846745052208
his project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though mr dixon of mary ’ s excepted to it , asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to newcastle . : 8.983555688315294
mr mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which , as it dwelt upon his memory , seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention : _talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi , o quirites , ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum romanorum magnopere anteponunt_ , while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach , the buck and doe of the forest glade , the farmyard drake and duck . : 5.657547222397242
valuing himself not a little upon his elegance , being indeed a proper man of person , this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced . : 8.958205690326302
the young gentleman , his friend , overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him , could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour . : 14.88824597591912
mr mulligan , now perceiving the table , asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and , seeing the stranger , he made him a civil bow and said , pray , sir , was you in need of any professional assistance we could give ? : 12.948669282634398
who , upon his offer , thanked him very heartily , though preserving his proper distance , and replied that he was come there about a lady , now an inmate of horne ’ s house , that was in an interesting condition , poor body , from woman ’ s woe ( and here he fetched a deep sigh ) to know if her happiness had yet taken place . : 9.96313076132386
mr dixon , to turn the table , took on to ask of mr mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence , upon which he rallied him , betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due , as with the noted physician , mr austin meldon , to a wolf in the stomach . : 10.817796522266843
for answer mr mulligan , in a gale of laughter at his smalls , smote himself bravely below the diaphragm , exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of mother grogan ( the most excellent creature of her sex though ’ tis pity she ’ s a trollop ): there ’ s a belly that never bore a bastard . : 7.8918887126170905
this was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight . : 8.980232466908474
the spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber . : 15.223433127879447
here the listener who was none other than the scotch student , a little fume of a fellow , blond as tow , congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and , interrupting the narrative at a salient point , having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head ( a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture ) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it . : 9.276772558473317
_mais bien sûr_ , noble stranger , said he cheerily , _et mille compliments_ . : 5.982046827748082
that you may and very opportunely . : 37.5016002344403
there wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity . : 12.463550422038209
but , gracious heaven , was i left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well , my god , i would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the giver of good things . : 13.838976719184497
gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness , ah , monsieur , he said , had you but beheld her as i did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap ( a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily ) in such an artless disorder , of so melting a tenderness , ’ pon my conscience , even you , monsieur , had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever . : 7.499628232978012
i declare , i was never so touched in all my life . : 23.440225327768026
god , i thank thee , as the author of my days ! : 21.962451426683305
thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours . : 6.973769364746208
a sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and , having replaced the locket in his bosom , he wiped his eye and sighed again . : 12.493621034686683
beneficent disseminator of blessings to all thy creatures , how great and universal must be that sweetest of thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond , the simple swain and the polished coxcomb , the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years . : 7.984640929473851
but indeed , sir , i wander from the point . : 40.73417016889261
how mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys . : 12.723374500539379
maledicity ! : 53.92878406661024
he exclaimed in anguish . : 45.78388460006212
would to god that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along ! : 13.739827249401898
i could weep to think of it . : 24.766692008726224
then , though it had poured seven showers , we were neither of us a penny the worse . : 14.839119107449275
but beshrew me , he cried , clapping hand to his forehead , tomorrow will be a new day and , thousand thunders , i know of a _marchand de capotes_ , monsieur poyntz , from whom i can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the french fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting . : 11.242419656244762
tut , tut ! : 17.013816380690717
cries le fécondateur , tripping in , my friend monsieur moore , that most accomplished traveller ( i have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in a circle of the best wits of the town ), is my authority that in cape horn , _ventre biche_ , they have a rain that will wet through any , even the stoutest cloak . : 8.253319311336742
a drenching of that violence , he tells me , _sans blague_ , has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world . : 10.233335656595427
pooh ! : 61.73255416452041
a _livre ! _ cries monsieur lynch . : 29.214026847116607
the clumsy things are dear at a sou . : 22.486556340398053
one umbrella , were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom , is worth ten such stopgaps . : 10.75050227333101
no woman of any wit would wear one . : 18.932313927784485
my dear kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for , as she reminded me ( blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies ), dame nature , by the divine blessing , has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our original garb , in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties , is the fittest , nay , the only garment . : 8.20516186711404
the first , said she ( and here my pretty philosopher , as i handed her to her tilbury , to fix my attention , gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear ), the first is a bath ... : 13.928360779594012
but at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge . : 9.917958241772803
amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and , while all were conjecturing what might be the cause , miss callan entered and , having spoken a few words in a low tone to young mr dixon , retired with a profound bow to the company . : 10.810850040327994
the presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry . : 8.103467078919902
a monstrous fine bit of cowflesh ! : 31.523983356813694
i ’ ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you . : 14.067025705563974
what , you dog ? : 70.23002338637909
have you a way with them ? : 50.43749536342618
gad ’ s bud , immensely so , said mr lynch . : 15.292980869147295
the bedside manner it is that they use in the mater hospice . : 31.593086711611754
demme , does not doctor o ’ gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin . : 8.440058535622
as i look to be saved i had it from my kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months . : 13.568549588980172
lawksamercy , doctor , cried the young blood in the primrose vest , feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body , how you do tease a body ! : 8.826912659218024
drat the man ! : 27.758315525005656
bless me , i ’ m all of a wibbly wobbly . : 19.8054870266582
why , you ’ re as bad as dear little father cantekissem , that you are ! : 16.540812102498844
may this pot of four half choke me , cried costello , if she aint in the family way . : 14.327778978174003
i knows a lady what ’ s got a white swelling quick as i claps eyes on her . : 19.427068264116308
the young surgeon , however , rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward . : 13.80094176012999
merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy . : 13.43931327645257
i want patience , said he , with those who , without wit to enliven or learning to instruct , revile an ennobling profession which , saving the reverence due to the deity , is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth . : 9.119224601332835
i am positive when i say that if need were i could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which , so far from being a byword , should be a glorious incentive in the human breast . : 12.812887031938795
i cannot away with them . : 43.59305217772228
malign such an one , the amiable miss callan , who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours ? : 14.040023482504084
and at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay ? : 14.664772791955228
perish the thought ! : 23.803226728221734
i shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of horne . : 10.333904997292494
having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door . : 12.793322907085418
a murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado , a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation ( for he swore a round hand ) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath . : 7.721468474576014
stap my vitals , said he , them was always the sentiments of honest frank costello which i was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what i always looks back on with a loving heart . : 9.034672851293395
to revert to mr bloom who , after his first entry , had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity . : 10.582160621796055
the young sparks , it is true , were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children : the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice : their testiness and outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from : nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf . : 6.905791437810504
but the word of mr costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity , born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world , which the dint of the surgeon ’ s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to , so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation ’ s chain desiderated by the late ingenious mr darwin . : 10.753818461663746
it was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and , being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast , he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and , by intercepting them with the readiest precaution , foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at , rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable . : 7.825052638582572
to those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy ( a habit of mind which he never did hold with ) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding : while for such that , having lost all forbearance , can lose no more , there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat . : 7.182258328361023
not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which , caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe , is ever ( as the chaste fancy of the holy writer expresses it ) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions . : 9.185450810468966
to conclude , while from the sister ’ s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was , however , it must be owned , not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the supreme being . : 13.483900645991419
accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour , saying that , to express his notion of the thing , his opinion ( who ought not perchance to express one ) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers . : 11.352466600013782
the dressy young blade said it was her husband ’ s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another ephesian matron . : 12.705239017503164
i must acquaint you , said mr crotthers , clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis , old glory allelujurum was round again today , an elderly man with dundrearies , preferring through his nose a request to have word of wilhelmina , my life , as he calls her . : 9.334329709390495
i bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon . : 14.926761990796162
’ slife , i ’ ll be round with you . : 23.32807029145544
i cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her . : 10.2145146693243
all fell to praising of it , each after his own fashion , though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap , a clerk in orders , a linkboy ( virtuous ) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household . : 9.687983417801552
singular , communed the guest with himself , the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them , that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity , that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest . : 6.134669407333464
but , he further added , it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for i have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together . : 11.083115091890695
but with what fitness , let it be asked of the noble lord , his patron , has this alien , whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights , constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity ? : 8.640409024292559
where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled ? : 13.283344922551487
during the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents ? : 8.001193077145482
has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received ? : 12.687875170902547
or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is , if report belie him not , his own and his only enjoyer ? : 15.667275339222712
far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady , the daughter of a gallant major , or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there ( as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done ) then be it so . : 10.79764735844334
unhappy woman , she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate . : 9.697558232019652
he says this , a censor of morals , a very pelican in his piety , who did not scruple , oblivious of the ties of nature , to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society ! : 12.94961245856759
nay , had the hussy ’ s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel , it had gone with her as hard as with hagar , the egyptian ! : 14.356040563920747
in the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in mr cuffe ’ s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic . : 8.40472903211874
it ill becomes him to preach that gospel . : 20.69550914785143
has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare ? : 13.860442161244174
if he must dispense his balm of gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him . : 4.268838854611008
his marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce . : 9.749362695036716
the lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which , when rooted in its native orient , throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but , transplanted to a clime more temperate , its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant , acid and inoperative . : 5.931039719144931
the news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the sublime porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence , who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born . : 11.716802367102623
when he had betaken himself to the women ’ s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council , silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates , chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier , broke out at once into a strife of tongues . : 7.573217240315197
in vain the voice of mr canvasser bloom was heard endeavouring to urge , to mollify , to refrain . : 14.203886062793115
the moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent . : 11.081507081543034
every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated : the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers , the caesarean section , posthumity with respect to the father and , that rarer form , with respect to the mother , the fratricidal case known as the childs murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of mr advocate bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused , the rights of primogeniture and king ’ s bounty touching twins and triplets , miscarriages and infanticides , simulated or dissimulated , the acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion , the agnathia of certain chinless chinamen ( cited by mr candidate mulligan ) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that ( as he said ) one ear could hear what the other spoke , the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep , the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein , the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid ( as exemplified in the actual case ) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix , artificial insemination by means of syringes , involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause , the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape , that distressing manner of delivery called by the brandenburghers _sturzgeburt , _ the recorded instances of multiseminal , twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents — in a word all the cases of human nativity which aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations . : 7.158973494647518
the gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest , by her movement , the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning , ardently and ineffectually entertained , to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation . : 8.66739235089758
the hypothesis of a plasmic memory , advanced by the caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for , envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human . : 10.320563661189617
an outlandish delegate sustained against both these views , with such heat as almost carried conviction , the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes , his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the minotaur which the genius of the elegant latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his metamorphoses . : 9.53896301673292
the impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived . : 19.432574537409185
it was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from mr candidate mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect , postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man . : 7.60113571265327
contemporaneously , a heated argument having arisen between mr delegate madden and mr candidate lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one siamese twin predeceasing the other , the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to mr canvasser bloom for instant submittal to mr coadjutor deacon dedalus . : 5.381835113743089
hitherto silent , whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice , he delivered briefly and , as some thought , perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what god has joined . : 8.214649319699067
but malachias ’ tale began to freeze them with horror . : 14.481545821401376
he conjured up the scene before them . : 35.45269565231611
the secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared ... : 22.028419095585065
haines ! : 214.37361977543227
which of us did not feel his flesh creep ! : 21.94296235361556
he had a portfolio full of celtic literature in one hand , in the other a phial marked _poison . _ surprise , horror , loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin . : 9.866291273563112
i anticipated some such reception , he began with an eldritch laugh , for which , it seems , history is to blame . : 14.460697723750359
yes , it is true . : 33.91657475397365
i am the murderer of samuel childs . : 17.06965931070258
and how i am punished ! : 69.62259769020574
the inferno has no terrors for me . : 23.54505434793863
this is the appearance is on me . : 29.045612906060718
tare and ages , what way would i be resting at all , he muttered thickly , and i tramping dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus ? : 9.761761337019708
my hell , and ireland ’ s , is in this life . : 39.273633200064864
it is what i tried to obliterate my crime . : 22.73892193923143
distractions , rookshooting , the erse language ( he recited some ), laudanum ( he raised the phial to his lips ), camping out . : 8.93778664143512
in vain ! : 188.53382863741848
his spectre stalks me . : 39.02113776126379
dope is my only hope ... : 12.900308642677007
destruction ! : 85.60250662726318
the black panther ! : 111.11518425069931
with a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back . : 14.80259004259289
an instant later his head appeared in the door opposite and said : meet me at westland row station at ten past eleven . : 10.584667035692693
he was gone . : 74.69691890098593
tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host . : 27.275342298123732
the seer raised his hand to heaven , murmuring : the vendetta of mananaun ! : 21.576043972442015
the sage repeated : _lex talionis_ . : 23.31309165184709
the sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done . : 11.797280174060358
malachias , overcome by emotion , ceased . : 8.078776161323253
the mystery was unveiled . : 51.143076068129375
haines was the third brother . : 46.32625983817047
his real name was childs . : 40.344574330996466
the black panther was himself the ghost of his own father . : 23.184785787190776
he drank drugs to obliterate . : 29.314279854854
the lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited . : 25.653337997262526
no soul will live there . : 26.682561761696352
the spider pitches her web in the solitude . : 27.62255536345452
the nocturnal rat peers from his hole . : 29.719708262921554
a curse is on it . : 53.80762466017247
it is haunted . : 66.21253074058276
what is the age of the soul of man ? : 38.41479542981761
as she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach , to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast , so too is her age changeable as her mood . : 10.274849801108605
no longer is leopold , as he sits there , ruminating , chewing the cud of reminiscence , that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds . : 10.29108741386144
a score of years are blown away . : 23.006784045977714
there , as in a retrospective arrangement , a mirror within a mirror ( hey , presto !), he beholdeth himself . : 12.058484548830364
that young figure of then is seen , precociously manly , walking on a nipping morning from the old house in clanbrassil street to the high school , his booksatchel on him bandolierwise , and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf , a mother ’ s thought . : 12.850653843146544
or it is the same figure , a year or so gone over , in his first hard hat ( ah , that was a day !), already on the road , a fullfledged traveller for the family firm , equipped with an orderbook , a scented handkerchief ( not for show only ), his case of bright trinketware ( alas ! : 13.02439989148198
a thing now of the past !) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin , shyly acknowledging ( but the heart ? : 9.495759844223993

the scent , the smile , but , more than these , the dark eyes and oleaginous address , brought home at duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm , seated with jacob ’ s pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle ( a meal of noodles , you may be sure , is aheating ), reading through round horned spectacles some paper from the europe of a month before . : 11.659667350798737

the voices blend and fuse in clouded silence : silence that is the infinite of space : and swiftly , silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived . : 7.445085562682504
a region where grey twilight ever descends , never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields , shedding her dusk , scattering a perennial dew of stars . : 4.8735158759899315
she follows her mother with ungainly steps , a mare leading her fillyfoal . : 13.423868999688214

ominous revengeful zodiacal host ! : 11.99276667228234
they moan , passing upon the clouds , horned and capricorned , the trumpeted with the tusked , the lionmaned , the giantantlered , snouter and crawler , rodent , ruminant and pachyderm , all their moving moaning multitude , murderers of the sun . : 8.033804088213257
onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink , unslaked and with horrible gulpings , the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood . : 9.94504519385867

it floats , it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams , emerald , sapphire , mauve and heliotrope , sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind , winding , coiling , simply swirling , writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till , after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol , it blazes , alpha , a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of taurus . : 6.405973404112753
francis was reminding stephen of years before when they had been at school together in conmee ’ s time . : 11.951776266004337

where were they now ? : 44.23784426594396
you have spoken of the past and its phantoms , stephen said . : 20.199049109277716
why think of them ? : 67.5625021792062
if i call them into life across the waters of lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call ? : 13.172921668266248

he encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves , smiling at vincent . : 11.267266916548888
that answer and those leaves , vincent said to him , will adorn you more fitly when something more , and greatly more , than a capful of light odes can call your genius father . : 8.915835207868982
all who wish you well hope this for you . : 14.314860450804346

o no , vincent lenehan said , laying a hand on the shoulder near him . : 25.591486706488848
have no fear . : 69.23516078293417
he could not leave his mother an orphan . : 22.68646553999327
the young man ’ s face grew dark . : 30.00095924355916
all could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss . : 22.82079422886066
he would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart . : 16.227693063037258
madden had lost five drachmas on sceptre for a whim of the rider ’ s name : lenehan as much more . : 12.403505803299078
he told them of the race . : 51.90225061679116

all hearts were beating . : 44.77070238833084
even phyllis could not contain herself . : 21.30248048548059
she waved her scarf and cried : huzzah ! : 13.675905800724387
sceptre wins ! : 43.87289026225
but in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse throwaway drew level , reached , outstripped her . : 10.390250368989387
all was lost now . : 46.5040770444367
phyllis was silent : her eyes were sad anemones . : 12.224280594703979
juno , she cried , i am undone . : 26.15102483969544
but her lover consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook . : 9.672018141529108
a tear fell : one only . : 30.84167905710776

what rider is like him ? : 37.613646529038846
mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his . : 10.946890426353924
but let us bear it as was the ancient wont . : 28.079955219857187
mercy on the luckless ! : 45.079004432666885
poor sceptre ! : 89.68700541876991
he said with a light sigh . : 46.171261158491674
she is not the filly that she was . : 28.305848729682435
never , by this hand , shall we behold such another . : 17.649785445344406
by gad , sir , a queen of them . : 34.802695592550904
do you remember her , vincent ? : 36.918156664489786
i wish you could have seen my queen today , vincent said . : 17.32293649189326
how young she was and radiant ( lalage were scarce fair beside her ) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin , i do not know the right name of it . : 10.28643285040658
the chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom : the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us . : 12.159527544790215
in the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with corinth fruit in them that periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge . : 8.48473075636992
but she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which i held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when i pressed too close . : 16.73508474762013
she is more taking then . : 27.74345966853352
her posies too ! : 61.540508726829756
mad romp that she is , she had pulled her fill as we reclined together . : 12.437562009752801
and in your ear , my friend , you will not think who met us as we left the field . : 19.80976424306438
conmee himself ! : 72.1320545572898
he was walking by the hedge , reading , i think a brevier book with , i doubt not , a witty letter in it from glycera or chloe to keep the page . : 14.422497858686121
the sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion , feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress : a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her . : 9.356873278711573
when conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries . : 12.303434772247027
but he had been kind . : 43.543757725142115
in going by he had blessed us . : 34.70920352513359
the gods too are ever kind , lenehan said . : 16.926768683482294
if i had poor luck with bass ’ s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely . : 10.87233344473021
he was laying his hand upon a winejar : malachi saw it and withheld his act , pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label . : 13.208887996871587
warily , malachi whispered , preserve a druid silence . : 7.2324616071542565
his soul is far away . : 46.19098875934179
it is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born . : 20.968934199390752
any object , intensely regarded , may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods . : 14.70170216127844
theosophos told me so , stephen answered , whom in a previous existence egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law . : 9.464779294257276
the lords of the moon , theosophos told me , an orangefiery shipload from planet alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation . : 10.37356662054057
however , as a matter of fact though , the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character , was not the case at all . : 12.676833771873932
the individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop . : 6.8167218697595215
during the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one bass bottled by messrs bass and co at burton - on - trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone ’ s remark on account of its scarlet appearance . : 7.671026089051106
he was simply and solely , as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself , which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings , after the moment before ’ s observations about boyhood days and the turf , recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn . : 9.152527286524368
eventually , however , both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with , also at the same time , however , a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place . : 12.054948109129153
the debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life . : 14.792665000989185
neither place nor council was lacking in dignity . : 7.9965000719989145
the debaters were the keenest in the land , the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital . : 21.74498440913474
the high hall of horne ’ s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic . : 9.888480823231914
a gallant scene in truth it made . : 20.41197439517144
crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking highland garb , his face glowing from the briny airs of the mull of galloway . : 14.6646306635197
there too , opposite to him , was lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom . : 8.369076693233085
next the scotchman was the place assigned to costello , the eccentric , while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of madden . : 9.463202231948824
the chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of bannon in explorer ’ s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of malachi roland st john mulligan . : 6.928700209890822
lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of socratic discussion , while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator , fresh from the hippodrome , and that vigilant wanderer , soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour , but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of lafayette has limned for ages yet to come . : 5.881662296577171
it had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which mr s . : 15.711708525975345
dedalus ’ ( div . : 23.49846692750548
scep .) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods . : 4.39601734918995
science , it cannot be too often repeated , deals with tangible phenomena . : 8.96210233599533
the man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can . : 11.413699708537477
there may be , it is true , some questions which science cannot answer — at present — such as the first problem submitted by mr l . : 11.285926055509202
bloom ( pubb . : 48.41597541586502
canv .) regarding the future determination of sex . : 7.875257041938115
must we accept the view of empedocles of trinacria that the right ovary ( the postmenstrual period , assert others ) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it , as most embryologists incline to opine , such as culpepper , spallanzani , blumenbach , lusk , hertwig , leopold and valenti , a mixture of both ? : 5.923268061196913
this would be tantamount to a cooperation ( one of nature ’ s favourite devices ) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position , _succubitus felix_ , of the passive element . : 12.833640677127102
the other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital : infant mortality . : 11.431320589501007
it is interesting because , as he pertinently remarks , we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways . : 13.80831428134916
mr m . : 103.42233692928315

by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust . : 11.580681869633542
these factors , he alleged , and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets , hideous publicity posters , religious ministers of all denominations , mutilated soldiers and sailors , exposed scorbutic cardrivers , the suspended carcases of dead animals , paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas — these , he said , were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race . : 6.750497215149092
kalipedia , he prophesied , would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life , genuinely good music , agreeable literature , light philosophy , instructive pictures , plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as venus and apollo , artistic coloured photographs of prize babies , all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner . : 6.549136805559094
mr j . : 87.09437619470293
crotthers ( disc . : 22.650678423410827

although the former ( we are thinking of neglect ) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative . : 6.599214635967588
in fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do , all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions . : 11.151745897124282
an ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by mr v . : 17.36620956600406
lynch ( bacc . : 34.004788414091685
arith .) that both natality and mortality , as well as all other phenomena of evolution , tidal movements , lunar phases , blood temperatures , diseases in general , everything , in fine , in nature ’ s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained . : 6.852342014593044
still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood ( though other children of the same marriage do not ) must certainly , in the poet ’ s words , give us pause . : 7.355397463404629
nature , we may rest assured , has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence ( modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal ) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development , an arrangement which , though productive of pain to some of our feelings ( notably the maternal ), is nevertheless , some of us think , in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest . : 6.803215731415394

for the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being , it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother . : 6.105074267893608

and as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more , to have her dear doady there with her to share her joy , to lay in his arms that mite of god ’ s clay , the fruit of their lawful embraces . : 12.057052653045337
he is older now ( you and i may whisper it ) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the ulster bank , college green branch . : 11.543846506297147
o doady , loved one of old , faithful lifemate now , it may never be again , that faroff time of the roses ! : 18.18004871347357
with the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days . : 17.37796222635103
god ! : 145.31841121852733

but their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside , hers and his , charley , mary alice , frederick albert ( if he had lived ), mamy , budgy ( victoria frances ), tom , violet constance louisa , darling little bobsy ( called after our famous hero of the south african war , lord bobs of waterford and candahar ) and now this last pledge of their union , a purefoy if ever there was one , with the true purefoy nose . : 7.071743050015441
and so time wags on : but father cronion has dealt lightly here . : 9.96930561516559
no , let no sigh break from that bosom , dear gentle mina . : 12.11037853789368
and doady , knock the ashes from your pipe , the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you ( may it be the distant day !) and dout the light whereby you read in the sacred book for the oil too has run low , and so with a tranquil heart to bed , to rest . : 10.058356960350695
you too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man ’ s part . : 12.1917025437659
sir , to you my hand . : 48.31269448562638
well done , thou good and faithful servant ! : 18.685028070004623
there are sins or ( let us call them as the world calls them ) evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait . : 11.751089849313074
he may suffer their memory to grow dim , let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise . : 11.622283569588411
yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances , a vision or a dream , or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast , at midnight , when he is now filled with wine . : 10.317902083559284
not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath , not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past , silent , remote , reproachful . : 9.359194488794174
the stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there , imposed , as it seemed , by habit or some studied trick , upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness , a _flair , _ for the cruder things of life . : 10.673738660007825
a scene disengages itself in the observer ’ s memory , evoked , it would seem , by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there ( as some thought ) with their immediate pleasures . : 11.54549025532848
a shaven space of lawn one soft may evening , the wellremembered grove of lilacs at roundtown , purple and white , fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop , one by its fellow , with a brief alert shock . : 8.502586890645405
and yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood , floey , atty , tiny and their darker friend with i know not what of arresting in her pose then , our lady of the cherries , a comely brace of them pendent from an ear , bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit . : 8.770119536736487
a lad of four or five in linseywoolsey ( blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched ) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands . : 6.363816851980993

but as before the lightning the serried stormclouds , heavy with preponderant excess of moisture , in swollen masses turgidly distended , compass earth and sky in one vast slumber , impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent , so and not otherwise was the transformation , violent and instantaneous , upon the utterance of the word . : 5.583258659805185

against the dark wall a figure appears slowly , a fairy boy of eleven , a changeling , kidnapped , dressed in an eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet , holding a book in his hand . : 10.197947094421577
he reads from right to left inaudibly , smiling , kissing the page .) _ bloom : _ ( wonderstruck , calls inaudibly .) _ rudy ! : 11.37076501307096

he has a delicate mauve face . : 26.527862053772942
on his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons . : 17.221195775200357
in his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot . : 13.314089203985791
his ( stephen ’ s ) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink mr bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting , off the reel , the propriety of the cabman ’ s shelter , as it was called , hardly a stonesthrow away near butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral . : 9.721531182159906
for the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which stephen repeatedly yawned . : 8.348043386168012
so far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition , both of them being e . d . ed , particularly stephen , always assuming that there was such a thing to be found . : 13.060960158535735
accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing , in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line , they both walked together along beaver street or , more properly , lane as far as the farrier ’ s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into amiens street round by the corner of dan bergin ’ s . : 8.355267351631378
this was a quandary but , bringing common sense to bear on it , evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did . : 14.822227643839824
so , bevelling around by mullett ’ s and the signal house which they shortly reached , they proceeded perforce in the direction of amiens street railway terminus , mr bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had , to vary the timehonoured adage , gone the way of all buttons though , entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing , he heroically made light of the mischance . : 11.015293077846684
so as neither of them were particularly pressed for time , as it happened , and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of jupiter pluvius , they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey . : 8.113539390035623
as it so happened a dublin united tramways company ’ s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion _à propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back . : 10.119015439005453
they passed the main entrance of the great northern railway station , the starting point for belfast , where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue ( a not very enticing locality , not to say gruesome to a degree , more especially at night ) ultimately gained the dock tavern and in due course turned into store street , famous for its c division police station . : 8.056803328303626
between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of beresford place stephen thought to think of ibsen , associated with baird ’ s the stonecutter ’ s in his mind somehow in talbot place , first turning on the right , while the other who was acting as his _fidus achates_ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of james rourke ’ s city bakery , situated quite close to where they were , the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread , of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable . : 9.248473823768695
bread , the staff of life , earn your bread , o tell me where is fancy bread , at rourke ’ s the baker ’ s it is said . : 15.710937301520183
_en route_ to his taciturn and , not to put too fine a point on it , not yet perfectly sober companion mr bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties , never more so , in fact disgustingly sober , spoke a word of caution _re_ the dangers of nighttown , women of ill fame and swell mobsmen , which , barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice , was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn ’ t look out . : 8.722610834412334
highly providential was the appearance on the scene of corny kelleher when stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or , failing that , the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before mr tobias or , he being the solicitor rather , old wall , he meant to say , or mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about . : 10.402878877127833
the reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen , whom he cordially disliked , were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the crown and , as mr bloom put it , recalling a case or two in the a division in clanbrassil street , prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot . : 11.787313955999831
never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city , pembroke road for example , the guardians of the law were well in evidence , the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes . : 11.683379689216661
another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything . : 6.136387702243928
you frittered away your time , he very sensibly maintained , and health and also character besides which , the squandermania of the thing , fast women of the _demimonde_ ran away with a lot of £. : 14.436617164366522
into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though , touching the much vexed question of stimulants , he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues ( notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in ) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically . : 7.3534936426536515
most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of stephen by all his pubhunting _confrères_ but one , a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs . : 14.060414546764374
— and that one was judas , stephen said , who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind . : 17.48456058129036
discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the customhouse and passed under the loop line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps . : 7.2102293069460766
stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox . : 11.999941038160381
he began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a _quondam_ friend of his father ’ s , gumley . : 10.636072719479628
to avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge . : 24.435845476381424
— someone saluted you , mr bloom said . : 20.92974809994628
a figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again , calling : — night ! : 16.574998092020248
stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment . : 12.871555676197147
mr bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least . : 7.738992063190947
though unusual in the dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper , famished loiterers of the thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment ’ s notice , your money or your life , leaving you there to point a moral , gagged and garrotted . : 7.014738039319086
stephen , that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters , though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised corley ’ s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice . : 11.6248993119558
lord john corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise . : 14.39824622956779
he was the eldest son of inspector corley of the g division , lately deceased , who had married a certain katherine brophy , the daughter of a louth farmer . : 13.15255240911499
his grandfather patrick michael corley of new ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been katherine ( also ) talbot . : 8.140854495186169
rumour had it ( though not proved ) that she descended from the house of the lords talbot de malahide in whose mansion , really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing , her mother or aunt or some relative , a woman , as the tale went , of extreme beauty , had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen . : 9.458289701962482
this therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as lord john corley . : 6.680567404100878
taking stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell . : 12.587108591543531
not as much as a farthing to purchase a night ’ s lodgings . : 21.106717715823294
his friends had all deserted him . : 23.273209676890087
furthermore he had a row with lenehan and called him to stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions . : 11.84587689242557
he was out of a job and implored of stephen to tell him where on god ’ s earth he could get something , anything at all , to do . : 15.889095087724717
no , it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way , both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn ’ t a complete fabrication from start to finish . : 14.372405104241361
anyhow he was all in . : 55.04833416129366
— i wouldn ’ t ask you only , pursued he , on my solemn oath and god knows i ’ m on the rocks . : 14.947646519190743
— there ’ ll be a job tomorrow or next day , stephen told him , in a boys ’ school at dalkey for a gentleman usher . : 18.314242281767413
mr garrett deasy . : 56.42423949243725
you may mention my name . : 32.132052601627294
— ah , god , corley replied , sure i couldn ’ t teach in a school , man . : 18.1888715782319
i got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers . : 29.837630609874978
— i have no place to sleep myself , stephen informed him . : 21.15398642133315
corley at the first go - off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street . : 12.045493187180568
there was a dosshouse in marlborough street , mrs maloney ’ s , but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but m ’ conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the brazen head over in winetavern street ( which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar bacon ) for a bob . : 10.464931014375452
he was starving too though he hadn ’ t said a word about it . : 16.381177780674406
though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still stephen ’ s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that corley ’ s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence . : 10.823093432080771
however _haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished . : 8.75293681687771
but the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of corley ’ s head that he was living in affluence and hadn ’ t a thing to do but hand out the needful . : 14.491923944163535
he put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for , to his chagrin , he found his cash missing . : 12.270869859051258
a few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation . : 28.51045165734387
he was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect . : 10.515148849440727
about biscuits he dimly remembered . : 20.224284621084323
who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy . : 13.641488556811995
however in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies , erroneously however , as it turned out . : 12.175076092715328
— those are halfcrowns , man , corley corrected him . : 15.822349739624947
and so in point of fact they turned out to be . : 23.303354456580774
stephen anyhow lent him one of them . : 30.138670650623656
— thanks , corley answered , you ’ re a gentleman . : 22.837192294345744
i ’ ll pay you back one time . : 17.6503876939716
who ’ s that with you ? : 42.838021250731636
i saw him a few times in the bleeding horse in camden street with boylan , the billsticker . : 21.24322268874539
you might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there . : 19.95672615871721
i ’ d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they ’ re full up for the next three weeks , man . : 16.644007743663295
god , you ’ ve to book ahead , man , you ’ d think it was for the carl rosa . : 17.611455017296336
i don ’ t give a shite anyway so long as i get a job , even as a crossing sweeper . : 13.791184339031771
subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed stephen about a fellow by the name of bags comisky that he said stephen knew well out of fullam ’ s , the shipchandler ’ s , bookkeeper there that used to be often round in nagle ’ s back with o ’ mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of tighe . : 12.848516404116781
anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable . : 11.213058401949086
mr bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman ’ s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work , it struck him , was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while dublin slept . : 10.00429644540295
he threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at stephen ’ s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when . : 10.458781863703946
being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity . : 7.44050982573748
palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round , in every deep , so to put it , a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether . : 13.805812666162252
in any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning . : 12.894107269633123
pretty thick that was certainly . : 34.605798665107
the pair parted company and stephen rejoined mr bloom who , with his practised eye , was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite . : 18.350590854782215
alluding to the encounter he said , laughingly , stephen , that is : — he is down on his luck . : 21.853448884011065
he asked me to ask you to ask somebody named boylan , a billsticker , to give him a job as a sandwichman . : 21.22662567038755
at this intelligence , in which he seemingly evinced little interest , mr bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger , rejoicing in the farfamed name of eblana , moored alongside customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair , whereupon he observed evasively : — everybody gets their own ration of luck , they say . : 9.235667384875144
but , leaving that for the moment , how much did you part with , he queried , if i am not too inquisitive ? : 19.098519220238966
— half a crown , stephen responded . : 37.71583093781924
i daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere . : 23.183041138943427
— needs ! : 162.76962982758613
mr bloom ejaculated , professing not the least surprise at the intelligence , i can quite credit the assertion and i guarantee he invariably does . : 10.08660670304297
everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds . : 14.834106966488795
but , talking about things in general , where , added he with a smile , will you sleep yourself ? : 15.643868504277934
walking to sandycove is out of the question . : 19.601575409139915
and even supposing you did you won ’ t get in after what occurred at westland row station . : 14.033430606122542
simply fag out there for nothing . : 23.849139117603208
i don ’ t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father ’ s house ? : 12.034525799027385
— i met your respected father on a recent occasion , mr bloom diplomatically returned , today in fact , or to be strictly accurate , on yesterday . : 12.793415820229933
where does he live at present ? : 24.603155159734193
i gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved . : 27.34277327719913
— i believe he is in dublin somewhere , stephen answered unconcernedly . : 27.8297074599475
— a gifted man , mr bloom said of mr dedalus senior , in more respects than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one . : 14.590301823380376
he takes great pride , quite legitimate , out of you . : 15.425318372060499
you could go back perhaps , he hasarded , still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at westland row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two , mulligan , that is , and that english tourist friend of his , who eventually euchred their third companion , were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give stephen the slip in the confusion , which they did . : 12.394448007019855
there was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however , such as it was , stephen ’ s mind ’ s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister dilly sitting by the ingle , her hair hanging down , waiting for some weak trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for maggy , boody and katey , the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper , in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded , it being quarter tense or if not , ember days or something like that . : 9.534949772458324
— no , mr bloom repeated again , i wouldn ’ t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element , dr mulligan , as a guide , philosopher and friend if i were in your shoes . : 9.74020863711651
he knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals . : 10.475068000153692
of course you didn ’ t notice as much as i did . : 20.399967321947543
but it wouldn ’ t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object . : 10.64432747512352
he understood however from all he heard that dr mulligan was a versatile allround man , by no means confined to medicine only , who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and , if the report was verified , bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at skerries , or malahide was it ?, was , he was bound to admit , an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise , so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy , pure and simple . : 8.444759972987843
— except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains , he ventured to throw out . : 17.09869551704639
the guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at stephen ’ s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light , none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less . : 8.165006904583416
grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that , high educational abilities though he possessed , he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet . : 8.233469983499058
adjacent to the men ’ s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way , there being some little differences between the parties . : 7.062670903917535
— _puttana madonna , che ci dia i quattrini ! : 9.625883234991477
ho ragione ? : 49.57870280849823
mezzo sovrano più ... _ _ — dice lui , però ! _ _ — mezzo . _ _ — farabutto ! : 10.173822201159822
mortacci sui ! _ _ — ma ascolta ! : 12.745714421406019
cinque la testa più ... _ mr bloom and stephen entered the cabman ’ s shelter , an unpretentious wooden structure , where , prior to then , he had rarely if ever been before , the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous skin - the - goat fitzharris , the invincible , though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in . : 9.49997538016411
a few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity . : 5.779422388954301
— now touching a cup of coffee , mr bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice , it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food , say , a roll of some description . : 10.798927425288806
accordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order these commodities quietly . : 6.972296159929949
the _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied , away though one redbearded bibulous individual , portion of whose hair was greyish , a sailor probably , still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor . : 5.70951004842588
mr bloom , availing himself of the right of free speech , he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute , though , to be sure , rather in a quandary over _voglio_ , remarked to his _protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious : — a beautiful language . : 11.189351945491925
i mean for singing purposes . : 27.094499908252057
why do you not write your poetry in that language ? : 20.130139389877304
_bella poetria_ ! : 21.756518994660002
it is so melodious and full . : 25.952868097294825
_belladonna . : 53.92878406661024
voglio . _ stephen , who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could , suffering from lassitude generally , replied : — to fill the ear of a cow elephant . : 11.035150147706812
they were haggling over money . : 22.19154447478097
of course , he subjoined pensively , at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary , it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it . : 7.630683304894111
the keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tête - à - tête_ put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun , or so it seemed . : 13.08663236559349
after which he beat a retreat to his counter , mr bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to . : 13.27172734780908
for which reason he encouraged stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him . : 9.753130887238694
— sounds are impostures , stephen said after a pause of some little time , like names . : 16.162282735603497
cicero , podmore , napoleon , mr goodbody . : 10.54738905746397
jesus , mr doyle . : 42.841680135192114
shakespeares were as common as murphies . : 9.48779842773382
— yes , to be sure , mr bloom unaffectedly concurred . : 24.10154205796773
our name was changed too , he added , pushing the socalled roll across . : 14.022943764133815
the redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded stephen , whom he had singled out for attention in particular , squarely by asking : — and what might your name be ? : 10.97531746066283
just in the nick of time mr bloom touched his companion ’ s boot but stephen , apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter , answered : — dedalus . : 12.412691026192526
the sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes , rather bunged up from excessive use of boose , preferably good old hollands and water . : 9.335552333610924
— you know simon dedalus ? : 56.4601766318645
he asked at length . : 44.139848986347694
— i ’ ve heard of him , stephen said . : 22.72629464874469
mr bloom was all at sea for a moment , seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too . : 15.363045507254594
— he ’ s irish , the seaman bold affirmed , staring still in much the same way and nodding . : 16.377506478416883
all irish . : 146.12246109120412
— all too irish , stephen rejoined . : 38.25468938952274
as for mr bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark : — i seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder . : 11.300369248151405
the lefthand dead shot . : 46.78222891690078
though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain . : 11.995225979459144
eggs on the bottles . : 53.407051745868515
cocks his gun over his shoulder . : 12.059976338312264
aims . : 67.94492493637387
he turned his body half round , shut up his right eye completely . : 15.530410451442242
then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance . : 10.008357521449861
— pom ! : 137.81595599312735
he then shouted once . : 44.67314225659244
the entire audience waited , anticipating an additional detonation , there being still a further egg . : 9.223444455430062
he shouted twice . : 77.37903252634923
— beg pardon , the sailor said . : 32.408157605744485
— long ago ? : 124.80962267827522
mr bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth . : 13.094232792926599
— why , the sailor replied , relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond , it might be a matter of ten years . : 14.313697523613676
he toured the wide world with hengler ’ s royal circus . : 16.989606508765622
i seen him do that in stockholm . : 38.153080164736096
— curious coincidence , mr bloom confided to stephen unobtrusively . : 19.215896912513337
— murphy ’ s my name , the sailor continued . : 39.76243671815574
murphy of carrigaloe . : 23.19742020919508
know where that is ? : 63.67363212453362
— queenstown harbour , stephen replied . : 37.90761401627702
— that ’ s right , the sailor said . : 28.65542752537142
fort camden and fort carlisle . : 9.995318349800394
that ’ s where i hails from . : 20.951279679543237
i belongs there . : 72.79977026882585
my little woman ’ s down there . : 31.656639577983338
she ’ s waiting for me , i know . : 36.41111212355337
_for england , home and beauty_ . : 13.814768816573524
she ’ s my own true wife i haven ’ t seen for seven years now , sailing about . : 11.572205457218914
mr bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene , the homecoming to the mariner ’ s roadside shieling after having diddled davy jones , a rainy night with a blind moon . : 11.305362887197056
across the world for a wife . : 33.80922967806928
quite a number of stories there were on that particular alice ben bolt topic , enoch arden and rip van winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember caoc o ’ leary , a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor john casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way . : 6.962691457484323
never about the runaway wife coming back , however much devoted to the absentee . : 19.139273399433606
the face at the window ! : 105.50310993531363
judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half , wrecked in his affections . : 8.546415878583197
you little expected me but i ’ ve come to stay and make a fresh start . : 16.633698543795035
there she sits , a grasswidow , at the selfsame fireside . : 22.581912430333848
believes me dead , rocked in the cradle of the deep . : 22.50016855399686
and there sits uncle chubb or tomkin , as the case might be , the publican of the crown and anchor , in shirtsleeves , eating rumpsteak and onions . : 12.634125960213911
no chair for father . : 33.287944324922634

murphy . : 97.98727867486195
the sailor , who scarcely seemed to be a dublin resident , turned to one of the jarvies with the request : — you don ’ t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you ? : 16.953824514759564
the jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand . : 13.272930269140574
— thank you , the sailor said . : 33.76872182069603
he deposited the quid in his gob and , chewing and with some slow stammers , proceeded : — we come up this morning eleven o ’ clock . : 13.99286509253267
the threemaster _rosevean_ from bridgwater with bricks . : 16.686820217281138
i shipped to get over . : 52.714954163632505
paid off this afternoon . : 26.108617676071937
there ’ s my discharge . : 33.675244503929214
in confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document . : 9.929324917262539
— you must have seen a fair share of the world , the keeper remarked , leaning on the counter . : 21.990574396797825
i was in the red sea . : 43.45400520525394
i was in china and north america and south america . : 13.921968876771405
we was chased by pirates one voyage . : 13.03484976699456
i seen icebergs plenty , growlers . : 18.860971866072653
i was in stockholm and the black sea , the dardanelles under captain dalton , the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship . : 16.634069442869308
i seen russia . : 67.66612287578972
_gospodi pomilyou_ . : 21.756518994660002
that ’ s how the russians prays . : 27.548416028636485
— you seen queer sights , don ’ t be talking , put in a jarvey . : 15.566034725679529
— why , the sailor said , shifting his partially chewed plug . : 18.925216961085113
i seen queer things too , ups and downs . : 16.692411471616033
i seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as i chew that quid . : 11.256846011922127
he took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and , lodging it between his teeth , bit ferociously : — khaan ! : 13.539115094168531
and i seen maneaters in peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses . : 12.593359339758106
look here . : 84.4127362621571
here they are . : 69.28575249045704
a friend of mine sent me . : 32.68464730633035
he fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table . : 11.057879463990012
the printed matter on it stated : _choza de indios . : 15.749727535602842
beni , bolivia . _ all focussed their attention at the scene exhibited , a group of savage women in striped loincloths , squatted , blinking , suckling , frowning , sleeping amid a swarm of infants ( there must have been quite a score of them ) outside some primitive shanties of osier . : 5.754085126242662
— chews coca all day , the communicative tarpaulin added . : 19.30804436859701
stomachs like breadgraters . : 16.209425497200503
cuts off their diddies when they can ’ t bear no more children . : 12.5931643523662
his postcard proved a centre of attraction for messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more . : 7.792265557244031
— know how to keep them off ? : 46.21233607235396
he inquired generally . : 71.96700021749382
nobody volunteering a statement he winked , saying : — glass . : 10.562926191054501
that boggles ’ em . : 37.337760061210375
glass . : 94.46039791285827
mr bloom , without evincing surprise , unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark . : 8.676491814391792
it ran as follows : _tarjeta postal , señor a boudin , galeria becche , santiago , chile . _ there was no message evidently , as he took particular notice . : 7.066223361853482
though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated ( or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite william tell and the lazarillo - don cesar de bazan incident depicted in _maritana_ on which occasion the former ’ s ball passed through the latter ’ s hat ) having detected a discrepancy between his name ( assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q . t . : 7.504947604504067
somewhere ) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend ’ s _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some wednesday or saturday of travelling to london _via_ long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to holyhead which was his longest . : 8.004342347261044
martin cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through . : 8.632720832753353
but even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking boyd ’ s heart it was not so dear , purse permitting , a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to mullingar where he figured on going was five and six , there and back . : 10.131521065866282
the trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable , especially for a chap whose liver was out of order , seeing the different places along the route , plymouth , falmouth , southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis , the spectacle of our modern babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement , tower , abbey , wealth of park lane to renew acquaintance with . : 7.807045567192135
another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts , margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas , eastbourne , scarborough , margate and so on , beautiful bournemouth , the channel islands and similar bijou spots , which might prove highly remunerative . : 6.71294783915304
not , of course , with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job , witness mrs c p m ’ coy type lend me your valise and i ’ ll post you the ticket . : 9.237974351541789
no , something top notch , an all star irish caste , the tweedy - flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the elster grimes and moody - manners , perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success , providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure . : 6.8912863184171025
but who ? : 126.12845645913238
that was the rub . : 55.19492594682546
also , without being actually positive , it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times _apropos_ of the fishguard - rosslare route which , it was mooted , was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally . : 9.808546076633135
a great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large , the average man , i . e . : 11.497219028165246
brown , robinson and co . : 23.600767772704007
it was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street , when the system really needed toning up , for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick - in - the - mud took me for a wife . : 9.583956606598523
after all , hang it , they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life . : 8.249621151225197
there were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island , delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation , offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around dublin and its picturesque environs even , poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram , but also farther away from the madding crowd in wicklow , rightly termed the garden of ireland , an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn ’ t come down , and in the wilds of donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d ’ œil_ was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while howth with its historic associations and otherwise , silken thomas , grace o ’ malley , george iv , rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men ’ s fancy , though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally , usually , by the way , on their left leg , it being only about three quarters of an hour ’ s run from the pillar . : 6.947120505610475
because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy , so to speak , and the accommodation left much to be desired . : 12.089296351129905
interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity , pure and simple , was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact . : 8.845735086796608
he turned back the other side of the card , picture , and passed it along to stephen . : 22.19111853746674
— i seen a chinese one time , related the doughty narrator , that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different . : 11.46066824417042
one was a ship , another was a house , another was a flower . : 28.229019961286532
cooks rats in your soup , he appetisingly added , the chinks does . : 15.169165018390986
possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on , adhering to his adventures . : 9.4692107454101
— and i seen a man killed in trieste by an italian chap . : 19.906518171082507
knife in his back . : 43.687435339736375
knife like that . : 40.8171557855431
whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position . : 7.9378741641028565
— in a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers . : 22.335933374857937
fellow hid behind a door , come up behind him . : 21.355301692157017
_prepare to meet your god_ , says he . : 8.942596832409844
chuk ! : 53.92878406661024
it went into his back up to the butt . : 44.677791205355774
his heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to . : 7.305362391601825
after which harrowing _dénouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors , otherwise pocket . : 6.37194958081713
— they ’ re great for the cold steel , somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all . : 15.974354625066473
that was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives . : 13.819111328697266
at this remark passed obviously in the spirit of _where ignorance is bliss_ mr b . : 9.547390460758459
and stephen , each in his own particular way , both instinctively exchanged meaning glances , in a religious silence of the strictly _entre nous_ variety however , towards where skin - the - goat , _alias_ the keeper , not turning a hair , was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair . : 9.371023785094327
his inscrutable face which was really a work of art , a perfect study in itself , beggaring description , conveyed the impression that he didn ’ t understand one jot of what was going on . : 10.352656612277297
funny , very ! : 40.32914197422329
there ensued a somewhat lengthy pause . : 16.205684611501372
one man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal , another the card with the natives _choza de_ , another the seaman ’ s discharge . : 8.296784030080943
mr bloom , so far as he was personally concerned , was just pondering in pensive mood . : 15.871928646334243
he vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday , roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles , when it took the civilised world by storm , figuratively speaking , early in the eighties , eightyone to be correct , when he was just turned fifteen . : 10.12327918663804
— ay , boss , the sailor broke in . : 27.137676420549713
give us back them papers . : 20.497908880677148
the request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape . : 15.127857718834417
— have you seen the rock of gibraltar ? : 23.52178967290487
mr bloom inquired . : 53.74429392986206
the sailor grimaced , chewing , in a way that might be read as yes , ay or no . : 17.598877961315424
— ah , you ’ ve touched there too , mr bloom said , europa point , thinking he had , in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so , simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust , and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn . : 12.369753059443347
— what year would that be about ? : 23.769884061934846
mr b interrogated . : 53.78774352831329
can you recall the boats ? : 22.36232293913238
our _soi - disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering : — i ’ m tired of all them rocks in the sea , he said , and boats and ships . : 10.007375265889893
salt junk all the time . : 21.181048826946892
tired seemingly , he ceased . : 35.47860695751866
on more than one occasion , a dozen at the lowest , near the north bull at dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt , evidently derelict , seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall , staring quite obliviously at it and it at him , dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings . : 9.088394114189592
and it left him wondering why . : 27.636289865095204
possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself , floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under , well , not exactly under , tempting the fates . : 13.116496033905905
and the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all . : 15.430754899402896
nevertheless , without going into the _minutiae_ of the business , the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large , no matter where living inland or seaside , as the case might be , having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called _ireland expects that every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the irish lights , kish and others , liable to capsize at any moment , rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy , not to say stormy , weather . : 8.15582090778067
— there was a fellow sailed with me in the _rover_ , the old seadog , himself a rover , proceeded , went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman ’ s valet at six quid a month . : 11.23250125899307
them are his trousers i ’ ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife . : 21.052828961173844
i ’ m game for that job , shaving and brushup . : 14.46745308682333
there ’ s my son now , danny , run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper ’ s in cork where he could be drawing easy money . : 13.22078718044112
— what age is he ? : 38.79880093659223
queried one hearer who , by the way , seen from the side , bore a distant resemblance to henry campbell , the townclerk , away from the carking cares of office , unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage . : 9.479665556651293
— why , the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance , my son , danny ? : 19.65791894986533
he ’ d be about eighteen now , way i figure it . : 14.385026065517492
the skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue chinese ink intended to represent an anchor . : 7.91869546582348
— there was lice in that bunk in bridgwater , he remarked , sure as nuts . : 15.614376125700145
i must get a wash tomorrow or next day . : 19.6709125012783
it ’ s them black lads i objects to . : 13.508836416735813
i hate those buggers . : 38.74003818133807
suck your blood dry , they does . : 13.081858299822837
seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner ’ s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure <NUM> and a young man ’ s sideface looking frowningly rather . : 19.16276366970193
— tattoo , the exhibitor explained . : 42.32774726850914
that was done when we were lying becalmed off odessa in the black sea under captain dalton . : 11.924351369357687
fellow , the name of antonio , done that . : 21.69116084140682
there he is himself , a greek . : 50.01044520093702
one asked the sailor . : 59.30269175429029
that worthy , however , was busily engaged in collecting round the . : 17.625909101361696
someway in his . : 65.51846954186763
squeezing or . : 25.00482548110019
— see here , he said , showing antonio . : 33.007513368015374
there he is cursing the mate . : 22.97424874346839
and there he is now , he added , the same fellow , pulling the skin with his fingers , some special knack evidently , and he laughing at a yarn . : 20.016850884349516
and in point of fact the young man named antonio ’ s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including skin - the - goat , who this time stretched over . : 7.821332420029327
— ay , ay , sighed the sailor , looking down on his manly chest . : 15.577978651783546
he ’ s gone too . : 41.47673401758608
ate by sharks after . : 18.589584755640082
he let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before . : 15.218618584528702
— neat bit of work , one longshoreman said . : 25.91959088485613
— and what ’ s the number for ? : 31.49804975339431
loafer number two queried . : 14.945491678492852
— eaten alive ? : 70.28406632742941
a third asked the sailor . : 50.41257369316995
— ay , ay , sighed again the latter personage , more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number . : 13.416940514258155
ate . : 90.96507496470433
a greek he was . : 81.86743939530146
and then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged end : — as bad as old antonio , for he left me on my ownio . : 12.2049370480879
the face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill . : 11.758932450162002
mr bloom , scarcely knowing which way to look , turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm , and , picking up from the table the pink sheet of the abbey street organ which the jarvey , if such he was , had laid aside , he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink . : 14.322101096823538
his reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on ormond quay , the partially idiotic female , namely , of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you ( mrs b .) and begged the chance of his washing . : 12.009449792754364
also why washing which seemed rather vague than not , your washing . : 10.675570959397174
still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife ’ s undergarments when soiled in holles street and women would and did too a man ’ s similar garments initialled with bewley and draper ’ s marking ink ( hers were , that is ) if they really loved him , that is to say , love me , love my dirty shirt . : 9.959339677155672
still just then , being on tenterhooks , he desired the female ’ s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off . : 13.145868548672693
round the side of the _evening telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there , viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper murphy ’ s nautical chest and then there was no more of her . : 9.509780023636305
— the gunboat , the keeper said . : 33.82469130696884
— it beats me , mr bloom confided to stephen , medically i am speaking , how a wretched creature like that from the lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses , if he values his health in the least . : 10.573530206850597
unfortunate creature ! : 40.1721613136177
of course i suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition . : 18.134154370596953
still no matter what the cause is from ... : 23.226063270108213
stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders , merely remarking : — in this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade . : 10.607936686039467
fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul . : 11.032302638243783
she is a bad merchant . : 49.06453076924295
she buys dear and sells cheap . : 18.52691211221877
the elder man , though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude , said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp ( quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject ), a necessary evil , were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities , a thing , he could truthfully state , he , as a _paterfamilias_ , was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start . : 11.08691898544875
— you as a good catholic , he observed , talking of body and soul , believe in the soul . : 23.534881265040152
or do you mean the intelligence , the brainpower as such , as distinct from any outside object , the table , let us say , that cup . : 16.331003575912316
i believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter . : 18.125463657460443
otherwise we would never have such inventions as x rays , for instance . : 9.170047835649079
do you ? : 75.35889834798095
thus cornered , stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say : — they tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible . : 11.47763957806088
it would be immortal , i understand , but for the possibility of its annihilation by its first cause who , from all i can hear , is quite capable of adding that to the number of his other practical jokes , _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both being excluded by court etiquette . : 10.088022188841567
mr bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple , promptly rejoining : — simple ? : 10.62302503382333
i shouldn ’ t think that is the proper word . : 33.40954084905036
of course , i grant you , to concede a point , you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon . : 16.443835991296247
but what i am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays röntgen did or the telescope like edison , though i believe it was before his time galileo was the man , i mean , and the same applies to the laws , for example , of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it ’ s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural god . : 13.254239735614965
— o that , stephen expostulated , has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in holy writ , apart from circumstantial evidence . : 11.294471907692303
on this knotty point however the views of the pair , poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages , clashed . : 9.80746028424537
— has been ? : 133.1416366117168
the more experienced of the two objected , sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief . : 17.809152236790272
i ’ m not so sure about that . : 20.903009727326047
that ’ s a matter for everyman ’ s opinion and , without dragging in the sectarian side of the business , i beg to differ with you _in toto_ there . : 14.875172211651064
my belief is , to tell you the candid truth , that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it ’ s the big question of our national poet over again , who precisely wrote them like _hamlet_ and bacon , as , you who know your shakespeare infinitely better than i , of course i needn ’ t tell you . : 10.833248712584687
can ’ t you drink that coffee , by the way ? : 17.675754339157102
let me stir it . : 27.072309493442
and take a piece of that bun . : 50.75544082155046
it ’ s like one of our skipper ’ s bricks disguised . : 27.4653630873192
still no - one can give what he hasn ’ t got . : 19.79652213987647
try a bit . : 50.80285061129359
— couldn ’ t , stephen contrived to get out , his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further . : 18.635708114447457
faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat mr bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the coffee palace and its temperance ( and lucrative ) work . : 7.811998202907806
to be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good , shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night , concerts , dramatic evenings and useful lectures ( admittance free ) by qualified men for the lower orders . : 6.867839382384181
on the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife , madam marion tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time , a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying . : 11.51038338614887
the idea , he was strongly inclined to believe , was to do good and net a profit , there being no competition to speak of . : 15.874563302725065
sulphate of copper poison so <NUM> or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn ’ t remember when it was or where . : 17.587011880707507
anyhow inspection , medical inspection , of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of dr tibble ’ s vi - cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved . : 8.706650466819129
— have a shot at it now , he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred . : 25.042471293237675
thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage . : 10.070126788266068
— still it ’ s solid food , his good genius urged , i ’ m a stickler for solid food , his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work , mental or manual . : 9.411474790025666
you ought to eat more solid food . : 23.763920241618045
you would feel a different man . : 27.28476260439319
— liquids i can eat , stephen said . : 23.19401852604926
but o , oblige me by taking away that knife . : 18.295213392108778
i can ’ t look at the point of it . : 28.41307751911768
it reminds me of roman history . : 29.814070059020853
mr bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article , a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly roman or antique about it to the lay eye , observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it . : 8.59768961891986
— our mutual friend ’ s stories are like himself , mr bloom _apropos_ of knives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_ . : 12.263842528841923
do you think they are genuine ? : 32.1644477399511
he could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots . : 9.832991531367325
look at him . : 37.95584849906084
yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel . : 9.218896583775118
he had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him . : 13.517810041056142
though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina , if a trifle prone to baldness , there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity . : 7.0704280173315315
he might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told , as people often did about others , namely , that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the antonio personage ( no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet ) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described . : 8.356612105707736
on the other hand he might be only bluffing , a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs , dublin residents , like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner _hesperus_ and etcetera . : 6.261211374988093
and when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn ’ t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him . : 9.373346489769112
— mind you , i ’ m not saying that it ’ s all a pure invention , he resumed . : 23.300566120268925
analogous scenes are occasionally , if not often , met with . : 8.811023577115401
giants , though that is rather a far cry , you see once in a way , marcella the midget queen . : 12.32135168917073
in those waxworks in henry street i myself saw some aztecs , as they are called , sitting bowlegged , they couldn ’ t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here , you see , he proceeded , indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee , were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up , being adored as gods . : 9.049489259037221
there ’ s an example again of simple souls . : 16.712297132406558
however reverting to friend sinbad and his horrifying adventures ( who reminded him a bit of ludwig , _alias_ ledwidge , when he occupied the boards of the gaiety when michael gunn was identified with the management in the _flying dutchman_ , a stupendous success , and his host of admirers came in large numbers , everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort , phantom or the reverse , on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains ) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it , he conceded . : 7.831413913195074
on the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little italy there near the coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or her next day on the quiet and , he added , on the cheap . : 7.646282019433763
— spaniards , for instance , he continued , passionate temperaments like that , impetuous as old nick , are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen . : 10.296329284698349
it comes from the great heat , climate generally . : 28.3131741947145
my wife is , so to speak , spanish , half that is . : 18.4252423394442
point of fact she could actually claim spanish nationality if she wanted , having been born in ( technically ) spain , i . e . : 8.79979994436032
she has the spanish type . : 46.37330028168584
quite dark , regular brunette , black . : 18.25848166312358
i for one certainly believe climate accounts for character . : 13.595963061351485
that ’ s why i asked you if you wrote your poetry in italian . : 18.111861023527165
— the temperaments at the door , stephen interposed with , were very passionate about ten shillings . : 16.658924005930608
_roberto ruba roba sua_ . : 8.777244415159576
— quite so , mr bloom dittoed . : 34.97188522479107
— it ’ s in the blood , mr bloom acceded at once . : 22.223059159782316
all are washed in the blood of the sun . : 28.03366256943834
coincidence i just happened to be in the kildare street museum today , shortly prior to our meeting if i can so call it , and i was just looking at those antique statues there . : 11.060985828435156
the splendid proportions of hips , bosom . : 19.89869997794348
you simply don ’ t knock against those kind of women here . : 17.533875772291708
an exception here and there . : 32.13312171386791
handsome yes , pretty in a way you find but what i ’ m talking about is the female form . : 18.232275308222373
besides they have so little taste in dress , most of them , which greatly enhances a woman ’ s natural beauty , no matter what you say . : 12.199279568793008
rumpled stockings , it may be , possibly is , a foible of mine but still it ’ s a thing i simply hate to see . : 12.570245484989828
interest , however , was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea , ships lost in a fog , collisions with icebergs , all that sort of thing . : 9.752763747357921
shipahoy of course had his own say to say . : 19.17621038362041
he had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon , a kind of wind , in the china seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing , he declared , stood to him or words to that effect , a pious medal he had that saved him . : 12.17864718456594
so then after that they drifted on to the wreck off daunt ’ s rock , wreck of that illfated norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of henry campbell remembered it _palme_ on booterstown strand . : 9.888134224466313
that was the talk of the town that year ( albert william quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the irish _times_ ), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror . : 8.47871876253817
then someone said something about the case of the s . : 33.45294159154698
_lady cairns_ of swansea run into by the _mona_ which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck . : 7.080222824430551
no aid was given . : 45.313465166155694
her master , the _mona_ ’ s , said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way . : 21.280508063396418
she had no water , it appears , in her hold . : 32.66465600741408
at this stage an incident happened . : 18.5295150258195
it having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat . : 11.983946651757476
— let me cross your bows mate , he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze . : 12.756093984866128
he made tracks heavily , slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door , stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left . : 14.410439152926632
while he was in the act of getting his bearings mr bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship ’ s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior , saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and , applying its nozzle to his lips , take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise . : 10.73824056272887
the irrepressible bloom , who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes , could by straining just perceive him , when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit , gaping up at the piers and girders of the loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved . : 9.037129934621904
some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor , evidently giving it a wide berth , eased himself closer at hand , the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank . : 9.379243352848418
a hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled . : 9.189612056437792
slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who , though now broken down and fast breaking up , was none other in stern reality than the gumley aforesaid , now practically on the parish rates , given the temporary job by pat tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of morpheus , a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ <NUM> a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of . : 8.445218838700086
and there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver . : 12.708896381602719
all meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in irish shipping , coastwise and foreign as well , which was all part and parcel of the same thing . : 9.56942942823859
a palgrave murphy boat was put off the ways at alexandra basin , the only launch that year . : 13.360919038544509
right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called . : 9.473416460529755
there were wrecks and wreckers , the keeper said , who was evidently _au fait_ . : 15.229634854191687
what he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in galway bay when the galway harbour scheme was mooted by a mr worthington or some name like that , eh ? : 8.085546198849329
ask the then captain , he advised them , how much palmoil the british government gave him for that day ’ s work , captain john lever of the lever line . : 13.656400360315569
— am i right , skipper ? : 41.126853878459244
he queried of the sailor , now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions . : 21.866574715838805
that worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds . : 10.570481953758057
mr bloom ’ s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably ( which it was ), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question . : 10.188674549289741
anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation - _cum_ - potation , introducing an atmosphere of drink into the _soirée_ , boisterously trolling , like a veritable son of a seacook : — the biscuits was as hard as brass and the beef as salt as lot ’ s wife ’ s arse . : 8.006866445999165
o , johnny lever ! : 36.6804064483377
johnny lever , o ! : 26.600260442618705
after which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided . : 8.425844509408302
skin - the - goat , assuming he was he , evidently with an axe to grind , was airing his grievances in a forcible - feeble philippic anent the natural resources of ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of god ’ s earth , far and away superior to england , with coal in large quantities , six million pounds worth of pork exported every year , ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by england levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein . : 8.292543305881942
their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact . : 17.417270625425548
you could grow any mortal thing in irish soil , he stated , and there was that colonel everard down there in navan growing tobacco . : 12.885927438519989
where would you find anywhere the like of irish bacon ? : 17.59111893978517
but a day of reckoning , he stated _crescendo_ with no uncertain voice , thoroughly monopolising all the conversation , was in store for mighty england , despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes . : 10.079723262288999
there would be a fall and the greatest fall in history . : 25.846911274838348
the germans and the japs were going to have their little lookin , he affirmed . : 23.16344146703663
the boers were the beginning of the end . : 45.19695057319497
brummagem england was toppling already and her downfall would be ireland , her achilles heel , which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of achilles , the greek hero , a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot . : 9.166420212753968
his advice to every irishman was : stay in the land of your birth and work for ireland and live for ireland . : 13.21860916054845
ireland , parnell said , could not spare a single one of her sons . : 18.677783934208133
silence all round marked the termination of his _finale_ . : 17.600957600875677
the impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings , undismayed . : 11.766443586695175
— take a bit of doing , boss , retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism . : 10.136689810935449
to which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view . : 10.775776379683837
— who ’ s the best troops in the army ? : 33.86937789126235
the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated . : 20.537606707856078
and the best jumpers and racers ? : 26.452998076313083
and the best admirals and generals we ’ ve got ? : 19.772184816312464
tell me that . : 67.02610929128367
— the irish , for choice , retorted the cabby like campbell , facial blemishes apart . : 10.689104375469674
— that ’ s right , the old tarpaulin corroborated . : 27.234581003332334
the irish catholic peasant . : 54.19199760228808
he ’ s the backbone of our empire . : 24.32054944976603
you know jem mullins ? : 34.6156846702014
while allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire , ours or his , and considered no irishman worthy of his salt that served it . : 7.876956793995843
then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter , both , needless to say , appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn ’ t indulge in recriminations and come to blows . : 9.182558871049814
from inside information extending over a series of years mr bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for , pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for , he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel , unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for , rather concealed their strength than the opposite . : 8.61289838228922
it was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if , as time went on , that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies , equally relevant to the issue , might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart . : 11.432900132991497
another little interesting point , the amours of whores and chummies , to put it in common parlance , reminded him irish soldiers had as often fought for england as against her , more so , in fact . : 9.671425676633563
and now , why ? : 88.82305081040593
so the scene between the pair of them , the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been fitzharris , the famous invincible , and the other , obviously bogus , reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick , supposing , that is , it was prearranged as the lookeron , a student of the human soul if anything , the others seeing least of the game . : 14.509575527835862
and as for the lessee or keeper , who probably wasn ’ t the other person at all , he ( b .) couldn ’ t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting , there always being the offchance of a dannyman coming forward and turning queen ’ s evidence or king ’ s now like denis or peter carey , an idea he utterly repudiated . : 10.099447831716379
quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle . : 8.695803805173629
yet , though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form , he certainly did feel and no denying it ( while inwardly remaining what he was ) a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife , cold steel , with the courage of his political convictions ( though , personally , he would never be a party to any such thing ), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south , have her or swing for her , when the husband frequently , after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal ( he having had the pair watched ), inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her , until it just struck him that fitz , nicknamed skin - the - goat , merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not , if he was reliably informed , actually party to the ambush which , in point of fact , was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on . : 8.65993874822137
in any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend , the pseudo skin - the - etcetera , he had transparently outlived his welcome . : 12.710508350616063
he ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high . : 15.614179381149127
like actresses , always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again . : 9.558267671822414
generous to a fault of course , temperamental , no economising or any idea of the sort , always snapping at the bone for the shadow . : 15.160195641822204
so similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that mr johnny lever got rid of some £. : 13.749980523312189
then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender . : 14.71787984335266
— he took umbrage at something or other , that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared , i let slip . : 16.379485921604683
so i without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his god , i mean christ , was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality i ’ m not . : 14.120450979792363
that was one for him . : 48.22416900773668
a soft answer turns away wrath . : 22.357651354837042
he hadn ’ t a word to say for himself as everyone saw . : 19.500888728263952
am i not right ? : 30.174529716315547
he turned a long you are wrong gaze on stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn ’ t all exactly . : 11.711944491979425
— _ex quibus_ , stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent , their two or four eyes conversing , _christus_ or bloom his name is or after all any other , _secundum carnem_ . : 8.758618431376174
— of course , mr b . : 53.32081648985114
proceeded to stipulate , you must look at both sides of the question . : 16.673451352199596
it is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country , they say , our own distressful included , has the government it deserves . : 8.475559908798248
but with a little goodwill all round . : 37.12746246639496
it ’ s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality . : 10.053268089663222
i resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form . : 11.63352751831415
it never reaches anything or stops anything . : 15.812047442895373
a revolution must come on the due instalments plan . : 26.41592554978428
it ’ s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular , in the next house so to speak . : 11.896033948005725
— memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes ’ war , stephen assented , between skinner ’ s alley and ormond market . : 9.193771771365407
and the whole world was full of that sort of thing . : 25.928935266933685
— you just took the words out of my mouth , he said . : 28.88001192268518
a hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn ’ t remotely ... : 11.294047189976206
all those wretched quarrels , in his humble opinion , stirring up bad blood , from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind , erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag , were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything , greed and jealousy , people never knowing when to stop . : 8.489822806982437
— they accuse , remarked he audibly . : 15.772500168577249
he turned away from the others , who probably … and spoke nearer to , so as the others … in case they … — jews , he softly imparted in an aside in stephen ’ s ear , are accused of ruining . : 11.763356668020416
not a vestige of truth in it , i can safely say . : 19.77979466000856
history , would you be surprised to learn , proves up to the hilt spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and england prospered when cromwell , an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for , imported them . : 6.908917312555236
they are practical and are proved to be so . : 17.99631506567344
i don ’ t want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are . : 14.721923709315124
but in the economic , not touching religion , domain the priest spells poverty . : 14.183619526169581
spain again , you saw in the war , compared with goahead america . : 20.956310661011536
turks . : 77.7762809998722
it ’ s in the dogma . : 44.71394455382521
because if they didn ’ t believe they ’ d go straight to heaven when they die they ’ d try to live better , at least so i think . : 13.522863707280028
that ’ s the juggle on which the p . p .’ s raise the wind on false pretences . : 11.899024553488001
i ’ m , he resumed with dramatic force , as good an irishman as that rude person i told you about at the outset and i want to see everyone , concluded he , all creeds and classes _pro rata_ having a comfortable tidysized income , in no niggard fashion either , something in the neighbourhood of £ <NUM> per annum . : 11.583777068249635
that ’ s the vital issue at stake and it ’ s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man . : 9.584840403576784
i call that patriotism . : 54.39070989153395
_ubi patria_ , as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in _alma mater , vita bene_ . : 5.930685548905511
where you can live well , the sense is , if you work . : 28.882965729994496
over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee , listening to this synopsis of things in general , stephen stared at nothing in particular . : 12.055918694179608
he could hear , of course , all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to . : 10.362661782897778
then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn ’ t say the words the voice he heard said , if you work . : 18.972901406647143
— count me out , he managed to remark , meaning work . : 19.256371317206444
the eyes were surprised at this observation because as he , the person who owned them pro tem . : 16.130030369364423
observed or rather his voice speaking did , all must work , have to , together . : 17.47909796927844
— i mean , of course , the other hastened to affirm , work in the widest possible sense . : 16.809939846121438
also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing . : 18.13385110584247
writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays . : 17.076718744700432
that ’ s work too . : 36.90758883253748
important work . : 42.23914681844965
after all , from the little i know of you , after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price . : 14.48380080326014
you have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has . : 12.202733359613761
you both belong to ireland , the brain and the brawn . : 33.14446551798883
each is equally important . : 23.831426859462333
— you suspect , stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh , that i may be important because i belong to the _faubourg saint patrice_ called ireland for short . : 13.421531832392835
— i would go a step farther , mr bloom insinuated . : 21.306932109773246
— but i suspect , stephen interrupted , that ireland must be important because it belongs to me . : 16.818013096486446
— what belongs , queried mr bloom bending , fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension . : 11.875744523310912
excuse me . : 39.035045348204484
unfortunately , i didn ’ t catch the latter portion . : 16.515337652397864
what was it you ...? : 54.686241136906716
stephen , patently crosstempered , repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely , adding : — we can ’ t change the country . : 8.022597277121546
let us change the subject . : 26.1882640240426
at this pertinent suggestion mr bloom , to change the subject , looked down but in a quandary , as he couldn ’ t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry . : 11.354826495985085
the rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part . : 22.429876056244765
needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state . : 10.013509610484272
probably the homelife to which mr b attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn ’ t been familiarised with the right sort of people . : 10.569206190334436
with a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from paris , the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister , failing to throw much light on the subject , however , he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves . : 8.82935862382571
for instance there was the case of o ’ callaghan , for one , the halfcrazy faddist , respectably connected though of inadequate means , with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper ( a fact ). : 8.857813779086035
and then the usual _dénouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends , after a strong hint to a blind horse from john mallon of lower castle yard , so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act , certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains . : 8.065914016177752
briefly , putting two and two together , six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to , antonio and so forth , jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne , then heir apparent , the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state , he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature , a thing good mrs grundy , as the law stands , was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it . : 9.041570019691882
ladies who like distinctive underclothing should , and every welltailored man must , trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two , she unbuttoned his and then he untied her , mind the pin , whereas savages in the cannibal islands , say , at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental . : 8.536082056241053
however , reverting to the original , there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps . : 16.37401210083359
sheer force of natural genius , that . : 11.391298727881395
with brains , sir . : 47.811450593861125
for which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad having in fact let himself in for it . : 10.181220349153993

highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and , even supposing , he thought a return highly inadvisable , all things considered . : 15.395086858327021
something evidently riled them in his death . : 29.00763916600011
either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands . : 6.000545783593476
of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the _alice , where art thou_ order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as fox and stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility . : 7.167836696193907
naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure , a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet , whereas messrs so and so who , though they weren ’ t even a patch on the former man , ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between . : 8.930372957884824

this gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his _entourage_ . : 10.397035666194677
as regards bloom he , without the faintest suspicion of a smile , merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts , to make matters worse , were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings . : 11.382424226827833
first it was strictly platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed , however , who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into . : 7.955293414409544
since their names were coupled , though , since he was her declared favourite , where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops , the fact , namely , that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel , having gained admittance in the same fashion , a fact the weeklies , addicted to the lubric a little , simply coined shoals of money out of . : 9.380598259463682
whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch , with nothing in common between them beyond the name , and then a real man arriving on the scene , strong to the verge of weakness , falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties , the usual sequel , to bask in the loved one ’ s smiles . : 12.455241036566468

though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection , carried away by a wave of folly . : 9.740384735943394
a magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order , as compared with the other military supernumerary that is ( who was just the usual everyday _farewell , my gallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons , the <NUM> th hussars to be accurate ) and inflammable doubtless ( the fallen leader , that is , not the other ) in his own peculiar way which she of course , woman , quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole , his erstwhile staunch adherents , and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations , very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose , thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass ’ s kick . : 10.822723635753574
looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream . : 14.036213226283074
and then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times . : 13.015628722443381
why , as he reflected , irishtown strand , a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since , as it happened , he went to reside on the north side . : 12.682278221361418
north or south , however , it was just the wellknown case of hot passion , pure and simple , upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was spanish or half so , types that wouldn ’ t do things by halves , passionate abandon of the south , casting every shred of decency to the winds . : 8.151114176577774

carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _sweets of_ , which reminded him by the by of that capel street library book out of date , he took out his pocketbook and , turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he . : 10.758541922148328
— do you consider , by the by , he said , thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table , that a spanish type ? : 16.14078428423222
stephen , obviously addressed , looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom , with more than vision of breasts , her full lips parted and some perfect teeth , standing near , ostensibly with gravity , a piano on the rest of which was _in old madrid_ , a ballad , pretty in its way , which was then all the vogue . : 9.970090103550627
her ( the lady ’ s ) eyes , dark , large , looked at stephen , about to smile about something to be admired , lafayette of westmoreland street , dublin ’ s premier photographic artist , being responsible for the esthetic execution . : 13.413374511186326

very like her then . : 42.94890628527896
beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who , he intimated , was the accomplished daughter of major brian tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen . : 8.926332858044502
as for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup . : 14.430687867362481
she could without difficulty , he said , have posed for the ensemble , not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the . : 14.934869325052613
he dwelt , being a bit of an artist in his spare time , on the female form in general developmentally because , as it so happened , no later than that afternoon he had seen those grecian statues , perfectly developed as works of art , in the national museum . : 12.185444434013547
marble could give the original , shoulders , back , all the symmetry , all the rest . : 18.013856689585474
yes , puritanisme , it does though , saint joseph ’ s sovereign thievery alors ( bandez !) figne toi trop . : 8.258623956282612
whereas no photo could because it simply wasn ’ t art in a word . : 14.374991799422506
the spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow jack tar ’ s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself , her stage presence being , frankly , a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to . : 11.434316814890432
but it was scarcely professional etiquette so . : 20.600518022047257
though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering , for sunshine after storm . : 11.7195020010358
and he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion . : 11.54782590555087
in fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled , good as new , much better in fact with the starch out . : 10.694955676673219
suppose she was gone when he ? : 43.32391993476386
i looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about ruby with met him pike hoses ( _sic_ ) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to lindley murray . : 8.80702138636464
the vicinity of the young man he certainly relished , educated , _distingué_ and impulsive into the bargain , far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn ’ t think he had it in him yet you would . : 12.366759132543223
besides he said the picture was handsome which , say what you like , it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter . : 17.12550318561213
and why not ? : 95.35640140251878
an awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business . : 7.467319707644833
how they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations , when the thing ran its normal course , became in due course intimate . : 6.603929739099974
then the decree _nisi_ and the king ’ s proctor tries to show cause why and , he failing to quash it , _nisi_ was made absolute . : 12.430252467961898
but as for that the two misdemeanants , wrapped up as they largely were in one another , could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course . : 10.493681276210749
he , b , enjoyed the distinction of being close to erin ’ s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen leader ’ s , who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery , ( leader ’ s ) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the _insuppressible_ or no it was _united ireland_ ( a by no means by the by appropriate appellative ) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the o ’ brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune ’ s private morals . : 10.399917209742814
though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she , however , was the first to perceive . : 7.136613453012479
as those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap ’ s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach , fortunately not of a grave character . : 11.517309858948428
his hat ( parnell ’ s ) a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and , as a matter of strict history , bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him ( and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity ) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he , as a matter of fact , having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else , what ’ s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother ’ s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect _aplomb_ , saying : _thank you , sir_ , though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day , history repeating itself with a difference , after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave . : 10.934378767979752
he personally , being of a sceptical bias , believed and didn ’ t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady , even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument , when , neglecting her duties , she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent , the upshot being that her affections centred on another , the cause of many _liaisons_ between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men , no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt . : 8.12744660026784
it was a thousand pities a young fellow , blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was , should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime . : 7.895963282150174
in the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when miss right came on the scene but in the interim ladies ’ society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the gravest possible doubts , not that he wanted in the smallest to pump stephen about miss ferguson ( who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to irishtown so early in the morning ), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers ’ ways and flowers and chocs . : 7.691766525911796
to think of him house and homeless , rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother , was really too bad at his age . : 10.490316930862882
the queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other ’ s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or , failing that , the homely humpty dumpty boiled . : 8.17071651714127
— at what o ’ clock did you dine ? : 27.1954488276663
he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face . : 17.19197973683944
— yesterday ! : 166.01905334758638
exclaimed bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow friday . : 15.076079589467865
ah , you mean it ’ s after twelve ! : 26.41614654047378
— the day before yesterday , stephen said , improving on himself . : 17.178174922581686
literally astounded at this piece of intelligence bloom reflected . : 10.786768282754197
though they didn ’ t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling , so to speak , in the one train of thought . : 8.679383555267192
at his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to parliamentary honours in the buckshot foster days he too recollected in retrospect ( which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself ) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas . : 6.450317011925701
for instance when the evicted tenants question , then at its first inception , bulked largely in people ’ s mind though , it goes without saying , not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums , some of which wouldn ’ t exactly hold water , he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion ( a partiality , however , which , realising his mistake , he was subsequently partially cured of ) and even was twitted with going a step farther than michael davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander , which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in barney kiernan ’ s so that he , though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals , be it repeated , departed from his customary habit to give him ( metaphorically ) one in the gizzard though , so far as politics themselves were concerned , he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows , chiefly , destruction of the fittest , in a word . : 7.4449859088004375
anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons , getting on for one , as it was , it was high time to be retiring for the night . : 15.310178306782928
the crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue ( somebody having a temper of her own sometimes ) and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog ( breed unknown ) with a lame paw ( not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he had hurt his hand too ) to ontario terrace as he very distinctly remembered , having been there , so to speak . : 8.389566870931972
on the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the sandymount or sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives . : 15.682763059330963
everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity , all things considered . : 17.674885066276737
his initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway . : 13.96116499684887
for one thing he mightn ’ t what you call jump at the idea , if approached , and what mostly worried him was he didn ’ t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly , supposing he did entertain the proposal , as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe , if found suitable . : 11.063818692101565
at all events he wound up by concluding , eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent , a cup of epps ’ s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up . : 8.792799678399188
a move had to be made because that merry old soul , the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot , didn ’ t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger ’ s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character ’ s whereabouts for a few days to come , alternately racking their feelings ( the mermaids ’) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody ’ s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address , as mr algebra remarks _passim_ . : 7.230242931826511
at the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew . : 11.111671700355148
people could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep . : 12.742888900206298
the most vulnerable point too of tender achilles . : 17.87251043031265
because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from carrick - on - shannon or somewhereabouts in the county sligo . : 9.686853325396287
— i propose , our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo , as it ’ s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over . : 8.752754678859459
you can ’ t drink that stuff . : 26.560769256530687
do you like cocoa ? : 43.49386278801778
i ’ ll just pay this lot . : 16.620183996407068
the best plan clearly being to clear out , the remainder being plain sailing , he beckoned , while prudently pocketing the photo , to the keeper of the shanty who didn ’ t seem to . : 12.162325660378
— yes , that ’ s the best , he assured stephen to whom for the matter of that brazen head or him or anywhere else was all more or less . : 12.91790653137679
all kinds of utopian plans were flashing through his ( b ’ s ) busy brain , education ( the genuine article ), literature , journalism , prize titbits , up to date billing , concert tours in english watering resorts packed with hydros and seaside theatres , turning money away , duets in italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things , no necessity , of course , to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it , and a slice of luck . : 8.274585107399274
because he more than suspected he had his father ’ s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well , by the way no harm , to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to . : 13.252677542244243
the cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy , earl cadogan , had presided at the cabdrivers ’ association dinner in london somewhere . : 13.845315100329952
silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement . : 14.015375962245134
then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir anthony macdonnell had left euston for the chief secretary ’ s lodge or words to that effect . : 10.223989537285025
to which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why . : 15.033840138907847
— and welcome , answered the elderly party thus addressed . : 13.246655956764254
the sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears . : 13.49898649413016
— are you bad in the eyes ? : 57.0962922143158
the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried . : 29.064407832784283
— why , answered the seafarer with the tartan beard , who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way , staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as , i uses goggles reading . : 12.224377893381503
sand in the red sea done that . : 25.344455431262016
one time i could read a book in the dark , manner of speaking . : 20.839998763820596
_the arabian nights entertainment_ was my favourite and _red as a rose is she . _ hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon lord only knows what , found drowned or the exploits of king willow , iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for notts , during which time ( completely regardless of ire ) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it , all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions , that is to say , either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark . : 5.862104863577425
to cut a long story short bloom , grasping the situation , was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost , being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion , taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming , making a grand total of fourpence ( the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers , literally the last of the mohicans ), he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures , coffee <NUM> d , confectionery do , and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way , as wetherup used to remark . : 9.715746607973456
seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the _élite_ society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their _dolce far niente_ . : 8.341027596797938
stephen , who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out , paused at the , for a moment , the door . : 15.352669378340682
— one thing i never understood , he said to be original on the spur of the moment . : 29.60562883135911
why they put tables upside down at night , i mean chairs upside down , on the tables in cafés . : 14.938656975245513
to which impromptu the neverfailing bloom replied without a moment ’ s hesitation , saying straight off : — to sweep the floor in the morning . : 12.977426866193397
so saying he skipped around , nimbly considering , frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion ’ s right , a habit of his , by the bye , his right side being , in classical idiom , his tender achilles . : 14.05455854998349
the night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though stephen was a bit weak on his pins . : 13.645146869709796
— it will ( the air ) do you good , bloom said , meaning also the walk , in a moment . : 27.106783021253996
the only thing is to walk then you ’ ll feel a different man . : 21.15563454062476
it ’ s not far . : 40.45071075617889
lean on me . : 34.24840854888122
accordingly he passed his left arm in stephen ’ s right and led him on accordingly . : 15.589109481352027
— yes , stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him , sinewless and wobbly and all that . : 14.291614690080149
anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones , brazier etc . : 11.735408415842855
where the municipal supernumerary , ex gumley , was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of murphy , as the adage has it , dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new . : 9.118901204432193
and _apropos_ of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class , probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings . : 8.998398454639403
so they turned on to chatting about music , a form of art for which bloom , as a pure amateur , possessed the greatest love , as they made tracks arm in arm across beresford place . : 13.695939589488294
wagnerian music , though confessedly grand in its way , was a bit too heavy for bloom and hard to follow at the first go - off but the music of mercadante ’ s _huguenots_ , meyerbeer ’ s _seven last words on the cross_ and mozart ’ s _twelfth mass_ he simply revelled in , the _gloria_ in that being , to his mind , the acme of first class music as such , literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat . : 10.355375387187559
he infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those moody and sankey hymns or _bid me to live and i will live thy protestant to be_ . : 8.694964691871057
he also yielded to none in his admiration of rossini ’ s _stabat mater_ , a work simply abounding in immortal numbers , in which his wife , madam marion tweedy , made a hit , a veritable sensation , he might safely say , greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade , in the jesuit fathers ’ church in upper gardiner street , the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos , or _virtuosi_ rather . : 10.725767164307731
there was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore . : 12.679404059879985
on the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the _don giovanni_ description and _martha_ , a gem in its line , he had a _penchant_ , though with only a surface knowledge , for the severe classical school such as mendelssohn . : 9.799899431147235
and talking of that , taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites , he mentioned _par excellence_ lionel ’ s air in _martha , m ’ appari_ , which , curiously enough , he had heard or overheard , to be more accurate , on yesterday , a privilege he keenly appreciated , from the lips of stephen ’ s respected father , sung to perfection , a study of the number , in fact , which made all the others take a back seat . : 12.907597214031938
stephen , in reply to a politely put query , said he didn ’ t sing it but launched out into praises of shakespeare ’ s songs , at least of in or about that period , the lutenist dowland who lived in fetter lane near gerard the herbalist , who _anno ludendo hausi , doulandus_ , an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from mr arnold dolmetsch , whom b . : 7.509638598052313
did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar , for sixtyfive guineas and farnaby and son with their _dux_ and _comes_ conceits and byrd ( william ) who played the virginals , he said , in the queen ’ s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one tomkins who made toys or airs and john bull . : 6.72474681382447
on the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse , dragging a sweeper , paced on the paven ground , brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and john bull . : 7.656119140134454
he inquired if it was john bull the political celebrity of that ilk , as it struck him , the two identical names , as a striking coincidence . : 15.267454070804954
by the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn , which perceiving , bloom , who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual , plucked the other ’ s sleeve gently , jocosely remarking : — our lives are in peril tonight . : 9.257924456117307
beware of the steamroller . : 43.58552060728086
they thereupon stopped . : 53.62807295166451
bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas , suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new , a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker , a hipshaker , a blackbuttocker , a taildangler , a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch , busy with his thoughts . : 10.945792952986103
but such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn ’ t a lump of sugar but , as he wisely reflected , you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up . : 11.830182815814348
he was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse , without a second care in the world . : 16.975274891037234
but even a dog , he reflected , take that mongrel in barney kiernan ’ s , of the same size , would be a holy horror to face . : 15.605128755607849
but it was no animal ’ s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel , ship of the desert , distilling grapes into potheen in his hump . : 12.735731036049163
nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained , nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees . : 9.090647574331795
whale with a harpoon hairpin , alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke , chalk a circle for a rooster , tiger my eagle eye . : 7.763963164405011
these timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from stephen ’ s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and stephen went on about the highly interesting old . : 10.799547408686363
— what ’ s this i was saying ? : 36.570193857125126
my wife , he intimated , plunging _in medias res_ , would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind . : 9.423653687227441
he looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of stephen , image of his mother , which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built . : 13.908074514951903
still , supposing he had his father ’ s gift as he more than suspected , it opened up new vistas in his mind such as lady fingall ’ s irish industries , concert on the preceding monday , and aristocracy in general . : 13.196316217133095
exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _youth here has end_ by jans pieter sweelinck , a dutchman of amsterdam where the frows come from . : 6.328034518789288
even more he liked an old german song of _johannes jeep_ about the clear sea and the voices of sirens , sweet murderers of men , which boggled bloom a bit : von der sirenen listigkeit tun die poeten dichten . : 6.84743002235659
these opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_ . : 11.305793786508712
bloom , nodding , said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did . : 16.35105739190841
a phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that , the rarest of boons , which bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out , could easily , if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain , command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of b . : 7.2435341264150255
( a huge ad in its way ) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success , being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites , if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he , a youthful tyro in society ’ s sartorial niceties , hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you . : 8.159602755529047
it was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic _conversaziones_ during the festivities of the christmas season , for choice , causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation , cases of which , as he happened to know , were on record — in fact , without giving the show away , he himself once upon a time , if he cared to , could easily have . : 11.402608335160304
added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at , going hand in hand with his tuition fees . : 12.517945111472692
not , he parenthesised , that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time . : 10.163762222258192
besides , though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree , original music like that , different from the conventional rut , would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for dublin ’ s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by ivan st austell and hilton st just and their _genus omne_ . : 6.52236881397115
yes , beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city ’ s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and , booking ahead , give a grand concert for the patrons of the king street house , given a backerup , if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs , so to speak , a big _if_ , however , with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows . : 10.899395341231685
and it need not detract from the other by one iota as , being his own master , he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone . : 9.367818993062746
in fact , he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other , possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort , hung on to him at all . : 15.39487960169581
the horse was just then . : 66.85326592973095
and later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed ( bloom did ), without anyway prying into his private affairs on the _fools step in where angels_ principle , advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who , he noticed , was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present , deprecate him , or whatever you like to call it which in bloom ’ s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person ’ s character , no pun intended . : 8.692511159018128
the horse having reached the end of his tether , so to speak , halted and , rearing high a proud feathering tail , added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish , three smoking globes of turds . : 7.972452352259849
slowly three times , one after another , from a full crupper he mired . : 15.73585804824248
and humanely his driver waited till he ( or she ) had ended , patient in his scythed car . : 13.143180842726954
side by side bloom , profiting by the _contretemps_ , with stephen passed through the gap of the chains , divided by the upright , and , stepping over a strand of mire , went across towards gardiner street lower , stephen singing more boldly , but not loudly , the end of the ballad . : 13.391233782393213
und alle schiffe brücken . : 10.256094156477959
the driver never said a word , good , bad or indifferent , but merely watched the two figures , as he sat on his lowbacked car , both black , one full , one lean , walk towards the railway bridge , _to be married by father maher_ . : 11.174655349315932
as they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their _tête à tête_ ( which , of course , he was utterly out of ) about sirens , enemies of man ’ s reason , mingled with a number of other topics of the same category , usurpers , historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn ’ t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower gardiner street _and looked after their lowbacked car_ . : 9.144740739728576

what rendered problematic for bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions ? : 9.46659701134346
the irreparability of the past : once at a performance of albert hengler ’ s circus in the rotunda , rutland square , dublin , an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where bloom , solitary , was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he ( bloom ) was his ( the clown ’ s ) papa . : 11.680730364459391

had bloom ’ s coin returned ? : 41.36615464351984
why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him ? : 10.640185270536449
because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions , the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity . : 7.105096623383565
he believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible , eliminating these conditions ? : 9.109649830764912
there remained the generic conditions imposed by natural , as distinct from human law , as integral parts of the human whole : the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance : the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence , the agonies of birth and death : the monotonous menstruation of simian and ( particularly ) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause : inevitable accidents at sea , in mines and factories : certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations , innate lunacy and congenital criminality , decimating epidemics : catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality : seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions : the fact of vital growth , through convulsions of metamorphosis , from infancy through maturity to decay . : 5.207061967253502
why did he desist from speculation ? : 16.730248466627412

did stephen participate in his dejection ? : 28.81612706795848

the heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit . : 13.195194029282083
with what meditations did bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations ? : 12.699633698553711
meditations of evolution increasingly vaster : of the moon invisible in incipient lunation , approaching perigee : of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way , discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft <NUM> ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth : of sirius ( alpha in canis maior ) <NUM> lightyears ( <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> miles ) distant and in volume <NUM> times the dimension of our planet : of arcturus : of the precession of equinoxes : of orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which <NUM> of our solar systems could be contained : of moribund and of nascent new stars such as nova in <NUM> : of our system plunging towards the constellation of hercules : of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars , in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years , threescore and ten , of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity . : 16.134409732989297
were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast ? : 9.6005790975886
of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth : of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth , beneath removable stones , in hives and mounds , of microbes , germs , bacteria , bacilli , spermatozoa : of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead : of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies , themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies , each , in continuity , its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies , dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till , if the progress were carried far enough , nought nowhere was never reached . : 5.486793320757038
why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result ? : 12.029814195722732
because some years previously in <NUM> when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places , e . g ., the <NUM> th power of the <NUM> th power of <NUM> , that , the result having been obtained , <NUM> closely printed volumes of <NUM> pages each of innumerable quires and reams of india paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units , tens , hundreds , thousands , tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands , millions , tens of millions , hundreds of millions , billions , the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers . : 15.99388574364434
did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race , given in species , and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer , easier of solution ? : 10.653701664475122
of a different order of difficulty . : 32.49477728224231
conscious that the human organism , normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of <NUM> tons , when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity , according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage , impeded respiration and vertigo , when proposing this problem for solution , he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under martian , mercurial , veneral , jovian , saturnian , neptunian or uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions , though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities , to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity . : 5.514730490685454
and the problem of possible redemption ? : 26.605425581053183
the minor was proved by the major . : 34.285733812410335
which various features of the constellations were in turn considered ? : 24.877945653019097
the various colours significant of various degrees of vitality ( white , yellow , crimson , vermilion , cinnabar ): their degrees of brilliancy : their magnitudes revealed up to and including the <NUM> th : their positions : the waggoner ’ s star : walsingham way : the chariot of david : the annular cinctures of saturn : the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns : the interdependent gyrations of double suns : the independent synchronous discoveries of galileo , simon marius , piazzi , le verrier , herschel , galle : the systematisations attempted by bode and kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution : the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion : the sidereal origin of meteoric stones : the libyan floods on mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist : the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of s . : 5.744905201822166
lawrence ( martyr , <NUM> august ): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms : the posited influence of celestial on human bodies : the appearance of a star ( <NUM> st magnitude ) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day ( a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns ) about the period of the birth of william shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of cassiopeia and of a star ( <NUM> nd magnitude ) of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the corona septentrionalis about the period of the birth of leopold bloom and of other stars of ( presumably ) similar origin which had ( effectively or presumably ) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of andromeda about the period of the birth of stephen dedalus , and in and from the constellation of auriga some years after the birth and death of rudolph bloom , junior , and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons : the attendant phenomena of eclipses , solar and lunar , from immersion to emersion , abatement of wind , transit of shadow , taciturnity of winged creatures , emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals , persistence of infernal light , obscurity of terrestrial waters , pallor of human beings . : 8.63040781514791
his ( bloom ’ s ) logical conclusion , having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error ? : 12.838343987332397
that it was not a heaventree , not a heavengrot , not a heavenbeast , not a heavenman . : 18.176689716040563
that it was a utopia , there being no known method from the known to the unknown : an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes : a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space , remobilised in air : a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence . : 7.500397876308728
was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle ? : 31.891991965344502
indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet . : 9.177109607629857
did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters ? : 6.901481277969773

• [ <NUM> ] yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _city arms_ hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot mrs riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out <NUM> d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first god help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them i suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice i hope ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about mr riordan here and mr riordan there i suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still i like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but i suppose id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was o tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf mountain the day i wore that dress miss stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides i hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing i was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it hynes kept me who did i meet ah yes i met do you remember menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface i saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at pooles myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes i ever met and thats called a solicitor only for i hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as i do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when i came into the front room to show him dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that i care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though id like to find out so long as i dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that mary we had in ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice i had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when i found the long hair on his coat without that one when i went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water <NUM> woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on christmas day if you please o no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters <NUM> / <NUM> per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but i was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof o yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but i told her what i thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her i wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters i found in her room the friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when i gave her her weeks notice i saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt i gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house i couldnt even touch him if i thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the w c too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the tolka in my hand there steals another i just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young may moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said im dining out and going to the gaiety though im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case god knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless i paid some nicelooking boy to do it since i cant do it myself a young boy would like me id confuse him a little alone with him if we were id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him i know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes i would because i told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when i was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german emperor is it yes imagine im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself i wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then i hate that confession when i used to go to father corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and i said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes o lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it i forget no father and i always think of the real father what did he want to know for when i already confessed it to god he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always i wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar i wonder did he know me in the box i could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to h h the pope for a penance i wonder was he satisfied with me one thing i didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though i laughed im not a horse or an ass am i i suppose he was thinking of his fathers i wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am i in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats i tasted once with my finger dipped out of that american that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because i felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment i popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up god be merciful to us i thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when i blessed myself and said a hail mary like those awful thunderbolts in gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no god what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle i lit that evening in whitefriars street chapel for the month of may see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when i lit the lamp because he must have come <NUM> or <NUM> times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has i thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after i took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters i think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no i never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye i had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when i made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time i let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what i went through with milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and mina purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it jesusjack the child is a black the last time i was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or i dont know what supposing i risked having another not off him though still if he was married im sure hed have a fine strong child but i dont know poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly i suppose it was meeting josie powell and the funeral and thinking about me and boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good i know they were spooning a bit when i came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of georgina simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about our lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything i was fuming with myself after for giving in only for i knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said he was he annoyed me so much i couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside i often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician i could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that i pretended i had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and i said over to floey and he made me the present of byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that i could quite easily get him to make it up any time i know how id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere id know if he refused to eat the onions i know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out <NUM> kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that i wouldnt so much mind id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though i had the devils own job to get it out of him though i liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen i was rolling the potato cake theres something i want to say to you only for i put him off letting on i was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case i let out too much the night before talking of dreams so i didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when i said i washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him i dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like lord byron i said i liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day i was in fits of laughing with the giggles i couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair i had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because i used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married i wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time i saw her she must have been just after a row with him because i saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me o yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ <NUM> for a postcard u p up o sweetheart may wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that id rather die <NUM> times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way i do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that mrs maybrick that poisoned her husband for what i wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it i wonder why they call it that if i asked him hed say its from the greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged o she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when i was in the d b c with poldy laughing and trying to listen i was waggling my foot we both ordered <NUM> teas and plain bread and butter i saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when i stood up and asked the girl where it was what do i care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one i did i forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that i never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the irish times lost in the ladies lavatory d b c dame street finder return to mrs marion bloom and i saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when i looked back and i went there for tea <NUM> days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because i was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if i only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet i dont like my foot so much still i made him spend once with my foot the night after goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung i could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that i what did he say i could give <NUM> points in <NUM> to katty lanner and beat her what does that mean i asked him i forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the lucan dairy thats so polite i think i saw his face before somewhere i noticed him when i was tasting the butter so i took my time bartell darcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after i sang gounods _ave maria_ what are we waiting for o my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him i liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that i dont see anything so terrible about it ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was <NUM> times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and i had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so i let him keep it as if i forgot it to think of me when i saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when milly and i were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain i saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going i could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so i halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till i took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till i promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket _o maria santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat i had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if i didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so i lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way i used to gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public i was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say i left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have i offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw i wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool henny doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades i hate an unlucky man and if i knew what it meant of course i had to say no for form sake dont understand you i said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in gibraltar with that word i couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day i liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the <NUM> big poppies because mine was the <NUM> th then i wrote the night he kissed my heart at dolphins barn i couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like gardner i hope hell come on monday as he said at the same time four i hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface goodwin called about the concert in lombard street and i just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor i had to say im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today i thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and i was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when i knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was <NUM> / <NUM> after <NUM> when i saw the <NUM> dedalus girls coming from school i never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly id want to get it looked after when i threw the penny to that lame sailor for england home and beauty when i was whistling there is a charming girl i love and i hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to belfast just as well he has to go to ennis his fathers anniversary the <NUM> th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed i couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the mallow concert at maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the <NUM> rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to cork i suppose that was done out of revenge on him o i love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions i wonder will he take a <NUM> st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well o i suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to howth id like to find out something about him <NUM> or <NUM> tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose i never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert i

singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for lord roberts when i had the map of it all and poldy not irish enough was it him managed it this time i wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the _stabat mater_ by going around saying he was putting lead kindly light to music i put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them sinner fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all i can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott i hate the mention of their politics after the war that pretoria and ladysmith and bloemfontein where gardner lieut stanley g <NUM> th bn <NUM> nd east lancs rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me im sure he was brave too he said i was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and i so hot as i never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom paul and the rest of the other old krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad i love to see a regiment pass in review the first time i saw the spanish cavalry at la roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the <NUM> acres the black watch with their kilts in time at the march past the <NUM> th hussars the prince of wales own or the lancers o the lancers theyre grand or the dublins that won tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in belfast after what i gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things i must buy a mothball like i had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married o let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot i care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if i could find out whether he likes me i looked a bit washy of course when i looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way mrs mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff i know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost <NUM> quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes val dillon that big heathen i first noticed him at dessert when i was cracking the nuts with my teeth i wished i could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for i didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too i wish i had some i could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when i was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on i want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but i dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all i think didnt he say yes and half the girls in gibraltar never wore them either naked as god made them that andalusian singing her manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear i could have brought them back to lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets id want advertised cheap in the gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one i have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line <NUM> / <NUM> obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am i getting too fond of it the last they sent from orourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink god spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or i must do a few breathing exercises i wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much i have the violet pair i wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first o no there was the face lotion i finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new i told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it god only knows whether he did after all i said to him ill know by the bottle anyway if not i suppose ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet i thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about <NUM> /- in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when i get it ill lash it around i tell you in fine style i always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if i buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners <NUM> whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the <NUM> years more i have of life up to <NUM> no im what am i at all ill be <NUM> in september will i what o well look at that mrs galbraith shes much older than me i saw her when i was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like kitty oshea in grantham street <NUM> st thing i did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity i only got to know her the day before we left and that mrs langtry the jersey lily the prince of wales was in love with i suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans id like to try a beauty up to what was she <NUM> there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of master francois somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a — e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant i hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that ruby and fair tyrants he brought me that twice i remember when i came to page <NUM> the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant jesus in the crib at inchicore in the blessed virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and i thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured h r h he was in gibraltar the year i was born i bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then i wouldnt be here as i am he ought to chuck that freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today i wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in mr cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up i could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly mrs bloom only i felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that i lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again i bought it simply to please him i knew it was no good by the finish pity i changed my mind of going to todd and burns as i said and not lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash i hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if i went by his advices every blessed hat i put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in grafton street i had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but i stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but i could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case im extremely sorry mrs bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife i just half smiled i know my chest was out that way at the door when he said im extremely sorry and im sure you were yes i think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them i had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing ill get him to keep that up and ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made <NUM> the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when i was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the queens own they were a nice lot its well the surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly i passed outside the mens greenhouse near the harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was <NUM> of the <NUM> wonders of the world o and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with poldy after the comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery i went into <NUM> of them it was so biting cold i couldnt keep it when was that <NUM> the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero i tried to draw a picture of it before i tore it up like a sausage or something i wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said i could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in holles street when he lost the job in helys and i was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would i be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or im a little like that dirty bitch in that spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that i asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple i had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you i had a great breast of milk with milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said i could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no <NUM> with the citrons penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for i snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor brady to give me the belladonna prescription i had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything i declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if i only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of master poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant i had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman i can feel his mouth o lord i must stretch myself i wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that i feel all fire inside me or if i could dream it when he made me spend the <NUM> nd time tickling me behind with his finger i was coming for about <NUM> minutes with my legs round him i had to hug him after o lord i wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank god some of them want you to be so nice about it i noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk i gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute thursday friday one saturday two sunday three o lord i cant wait till monday frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those roasting engines stifling it was today im glad i burned the half of those old freemans and photo bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the w c i ’ ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last januarys paper and all those old overcoats i bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep i thought it was going to get like gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their <NUM> rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend

affly hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at la linea when that matador gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why i was afraid when that other ferocious old bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the <NUM> things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses i never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever i suppose theyre dead long ago the <NUM> of

me how to settle it at the back when i put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was i then the night of the storm i slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the alameda esplanade when i was with father and captain grove i looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met i felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing i remember after when i looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like thomas in the shadow of ashlydyat i had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose i didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but i could have stopped it in time she gave me the moonstone to read that was the first i read of wilkie collins east lynne i read and the shadow of ashlydyat mrs henry wood henry dunbar by that other woman i lent him afterwards with mulveys photo in it so as he see i wasnt without and lord lytton eugene aram molly bawn she gave me by mrs hungerford on account of the name i dont like books with a molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it o this blanket is too heavy on me thats better i havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better i used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when i stood up they were so fattish and firm when i got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets i couldnt read a line lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never i remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious i had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt i cry yes i believe i did or near it my lips were taittering when i said goodbye she had a gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went i was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general ulysses grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain groves and father talking about rorkes drift and plevna and sir garnet wolseley and gordon at khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when i was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along i suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few i posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes i could fight with my nails listening to that old arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in holles street the nurse was after

matter they have it all in their tail if you ask me those country gougers up in the city arms intelligence they had a damn sight less than the bulls and cows they were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed dear madam only his letter and the card from milly this morning see she wrote a letter to

mulveys was the first when i was in bed that morning and mrs rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when i asked her to hand me and i pointing at them i couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near <NUM> or a <NUM> her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the union jack flying with all her carabineros because <NUM> drunken english sailors took all the rock from them and because i didnt run into mass often enough in santa maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing <NUM> times on easter sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his majestad an admirer he signed it i near jumped out of my skin i wanted to pick him up when i saw him following me along the calle real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but i never thought hed write making an appointment i had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing i remember shall i wear a white rose and i wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young i put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did i tell him i was engaged for for fun to the son of a spanish nobleman named don miguel de la flora and he believed me that i was to be married to him in <NUM> years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things i told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the spanish girls he didnt like i suppose one of them wouldnt have him i got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till i taught him cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left may yes it was may when the infant king of spain was born im always like that in the spring id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near oharas tower i told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old barbary apes they sent to clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back mrs rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me i had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as i could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump i said i was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place i suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and saint michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there i was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had i could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but i wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after i tried with the banana but i was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes o yes i pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but i opened my legs i wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because i had a skirt opening up the side i tormented the life out of him first tickling him i loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same i liked him like that moaning i made him blush a little when i got over him that way when i unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them molly darling he called me what was his name jack joe harry mulvey was it yes i think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so i went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back lord its just like yesterday to me and if i was married hed do it to me and i promised him yes faithfully id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly <NUM> years if i said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who i might recognise him hes young still about <NUM> perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what i did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the chronicle i was a bit wild after when i blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from benady bros and exploded it lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the hebrew on them i wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as i settled it straight h m s calypso swinging my hat that old bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers god send him sense and me more money i suppose theyre called after him i never thought that would be my name bloom when i used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige m bloom youre looking blooming josie used to say after i married him well its better than breen or briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them mrs ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom mulvey i wouldnt go mad about either or suppose i divorced him mrs boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the lord knows after the lovely one she had lunita laredo the fun we had running along williss road to europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs i loved looking down at them i was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to india he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to

hot buttered toast i suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and i love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake i wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but i hate their claws i wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as i wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice i bought i think ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it friday yes i will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those <NUM> lb pots of mixed plum and

the letters no not with boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow i hate those ruck of mary ann coalboxes out for the day whit monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap i dont know who he is with that other beauty burke out of the city arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats <NUM> consolation i wonder what kind is that book he brought me sweets of sin by a gentleman of fashion some other mr de kock i suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another i couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat i had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old luigi near a hundred they said came from genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings i dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at i suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides i dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night i suppose ill have to put up with it i never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but i saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns o how nice i said whatever i liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in lloyds weekly news <NUM> years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from i couldnt rest easy till i bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed id cut them off him so i would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night i was sure i heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the lord knows still its the feeling especially now with milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and boylan thats why he did it im certain the way he plots and plans everything out i couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless i bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when i put the chair against the door just as i was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that i got that little italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for <NUM> shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands i noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say i pretend things can he im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him i suppose he thinks im finished out and laid on the shelf well im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with tom devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of murray girls calling for her can milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in nelson street riding harry devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose i smelt it off her dress when i was biting off the thread of the button i sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me i tell you only i oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in <NUM> halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and i had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when i was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the only way in the theatre royal take your foot away out of that i hate people touching me afraid of her life id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the gaiety for beerbohm tree in trilby the last time ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft i think i saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside switzers window at the same little game i recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the broadstone going away well i hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way i did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet i never came properly till i was what <NUM> or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that conny connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had martin harvey for breakfast dinner and supper i thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing i suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man i suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags i have wanting to put her hair up at <NUM> my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way i was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when i asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met mrs joe gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till i gave her <NUM> damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting i was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or i didnt sleep the night before cheese i ate was it and i told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith i will that was the last time she turned on the teartap i was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am i ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old mrs fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job i found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser i knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially simon dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us i wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head i ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat i told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her ill have to hunt around again for someone every day i get up theres some new thing on sweet god sweet god well when im stretched out dead in my grave i suppose ill have some peace i want to get up a minute if im let wait o jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am i to do friday saturday sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do god knows theres always something wrong with us <NUM> days every <NUM> or <NUM> weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that michael gunn gave him to see mrs kendal and her husband at the gaiety something he did about insurance for him in drimmies i was fit to be tied though i wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about spinoza and his soul thats dead i suppose millions of years ago i smiled the best i could all in a swamp leaning forward as if i was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag i wont forget that wife of scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted i suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it i wish he had what i had then hed boo i bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what o patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is i dont want to ruin the clean sheets i just put on i suppose the clean linen i wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced <NUM> times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply o jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens i suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till i suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom i wonder is it nicer in the day i think it is easy i think ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me i might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode i wonder was i too heavy sitting on his knee i made him sit on the easychair purposely when i took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me i hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy god i remember one time i could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy o lord how noisy i hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget i bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy god i wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman o lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy o how the waters come down at lahore who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have i something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last i whit monday yes its only about <NUM> weeks i ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before i married him when i had that white thing coming from me and floey made me go to that dry old stick dr collins for womens diseases on pembroke road your vagina he called it i suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right i wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what i did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if i smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments i suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what i thought he was talking about the rock of gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only i like letting myself down after in the hole as far as i can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it i suppose i always used to know by millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had i frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways i wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or god knows what else still i liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap o anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my precious one everything connected with your glorious body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself <NUM> and <NUM> times a day sometimes and i said i hadnt are you sure o yes i said i am quite sure in a way that shut him up i knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me i dont know how the first night ever we met when i was living in rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about <NUM> minutes as if we met somewhere i suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the doyles said he was going to stand for a member of parliament o wasnt i the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the huguenots to sing in french to be more classy o beau pays de la touraine that i never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very <NUM> st opportunity he got a chance in brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the albion milk and sulphur soap i used to use and the gelatine still round it o i laughed myself sick at him that day i better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it i suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that indian god he took me to show one wet sunday in the museum in kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and our lords both put together all over asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody i suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes i know i hope the old press doesnt creak ah i knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her o this nuisance of a thing i hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up god help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old cohen i suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from lord napier that i used to admire when i was a little girl because i told him easy piano o i like my bed god here we are as bad as ever after <NUM> years how many houses were we in at all raymond terrace and ontario terrace and lombard street and holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our <NUM> sticks of furniture and then the city arms hotel worse and worse says warden daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it thoms and helys and mr cuffes and drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the freeman too like the rest on account of those sinner fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers i saw on him wait theres georges church bells wait <NUM> quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first ill look at his shirt to see or ill see if he has that french letter still in his pocketbook i suppose he thinks i dont know deceitful men all their <NUM> pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the aristocrats masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs i suppose im nothing any more when i wouldnt let him lick me in holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so i thought i stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or i dont know what he forgets that wethen i dont ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles i wonder was it her josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and boylan though as for her denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when i was with him with milly at the college races that hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down i tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of mr paddy dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black l boom and tom kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens w c drunk in some place or other and martin cunningham and the two dedaluses and fanny mcoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day i see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially jack power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if i can help it making fun of him then behind his back i know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor paddy dignam all the same im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and <NUM> children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting bill bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the glencree dinner and ben dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying <NUM> /- in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and simon dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when i sang maritana with him at freddy mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart _sweet_heart he always sang it not like bartell darcy sweet _tart_ goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath o maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to may goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now i wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of italian and im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me i ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still i look young in it i wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not i saw him driving down to the kingsbridge station with his father and mother i was in mourning thats <NUM> years ago now yes hed be <NUM> though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me i heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat i suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when i saw him at mat dillons he liked me too i remember they all do wait by god yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when i laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before i thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the <NUM> th card after that the <NUM> of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the <NUM> queens and the <NUM> of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and <NUM> red <NUM> s for new garments look at that and didnt i dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it i hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at i always liked poetry when i was a girl first i thought he was a poet like lord byron and not an ounce of it in his composition i thought he was quite different i wonder is he too young hes about wait <NUM> i was married <NUM> milly is <NUM> yesterday <NUM> what age was he then at dillons <NUM> or <NUM> about <NUM> i suppose hes <NUM> or more im not too old for him if hes <NUM> or <NUM> i hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of trinity college hes very young to be a professor i hope hes not a professor like goodwin was he was a potent professor of john jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well i suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from tarifa the lighthouse at europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will i ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the lord knows to have an intelligent person

distinguished id like to meet a man like that god not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men i could see down in margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in

see if the wishcard comes out or ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out ill read and study all i can find or learn a bit off by heart if i knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and i can teach him the other part ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our <NUM> photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous o but then what am i going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because i didnt call him hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of julius caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion god im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old lion would o well i suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always i wished i was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle john has a thing long i heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of marrowbone lane my aunt mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once i start i tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in fair tyrants of course the man never even casts a <NUM> nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for id like to know i cant help it if im young still can i its a wonder im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not

same <NUM> lumps of lard before ever id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough i kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced <NUM> times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the lord god i was thinking would i go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose i was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could i only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that k c lives up somewhere this way coming out of hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it i knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when i turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only i suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease o move over your big carcass out of that for the love of mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great suggester don poldo de la flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between <NUM> <NUM> s too in prison for lord knows what he does that i dont know and im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will i indeed did you ever see me running id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt i dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what i never had thats why i suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house i suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and i none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when i was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether i suppose i oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket i knitted crying as i was but give it to some poor child but i knew well id never have another our <NUM> st death too it was we were never the same since o im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more i wonder why he wouldnt stay the night i felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting god knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent i used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you i hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches i suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room i suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly <NUM> of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm dedalus i wonder its like those names in gibraltar delapaz delagracia they had the devils queer names there father vilaplana of santa maria that gave me the rosary rosales y oreilly in the calle las siete revueltas and pisimbo and mrs opisso in governor street o what a name id go and drown myself in the first river if i had a name like her o my and all the bits of streets paradise ramp and bedlam ramp and rodgers ramp and crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if i am a harumscarum i know i am a bit i declare to god i dont feel a day older than then i

or thing pity i never tried to read that novel cantankerous mrs rubio lent me by valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways i always knew wed go away in the end i can tell him the spanish and he tell me the italian then hell see im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly i could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as i didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like i never could bear the look of them in abrines i could do the criada the room looks all right since i changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time id have to introduce myself not knowing me from adam very funny wouldnt it im his wife or pretend we were in spain with him half awake without a gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for <NUM> he can make it for <NUM> im sure im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person id have to get a nice pair of red slippers

the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why i liked him because i saw he understood or felt what a woman is and i knew i could always get round him and i gave him all the pleasure i could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and i wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky i was thinking of so many things he didnt know of mulvey and mr stanhope and hester and father and old captain groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and i say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the greeks and the jews and the arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of europe and duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside larby sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and ronda with the old windows of the posadas <NUM> glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and o that awful deepdown torrent o and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and gibraltar as a girl where i was a flower of the mountain yes when i put the rose in my hair like the andalusian girls used or shall i wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the moorish wall and i thought well as well him as another and then i asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would i yes to say yes my mountain flower and first i put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes i said yes i will yes
