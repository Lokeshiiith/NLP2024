it is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife . : 17.450427415520156
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters . : 11.258081891079868
" my dear mr . : 53.17252782460752
bennet ," said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that netherfield park is let at last ?" mr . : 11.938928518683534
bennet replied that he had not . : 57.808933676804244
" but it is ," returned she ; " for mrs . : 18.288205317943024
long has just been here , and she told me all about it ." mr . : 16.20329506845692
bennet made no answer . : 48.66822152376079
" do not you want to know who has taken it ?" cried his wife impatiently . : 19.976071169921937
" _you_ want to tell me , and i have no objection to hearing it ." this was invitation enough . : 17.94727636031104
long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england ; that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr . : 10.297151652830296
single , my dear , to be sure ! : 28.843232399804627
a single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year . : 11.588823589053792
what a fine thing for our girls !" " how so ? : 20.411526948361523
bennet ," replied his wife , " how can you be so tiresome ! : 22.45527762914532
you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them ." " is that his design in settling here ?" " design ! : 17.30804818301792
nonsense , how can you talk so ! : 19.190650326403098
but it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes ." " i see no occasion for that . : 14.32489149477076
you and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , mr . : 17.381543265119973
bingley might like you the best of the party ." " my dear , you flatter me . : 18.79237991245775
i certainly _have_ had my share of beauty , but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now . : 15.540373579646738
bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood ." " it is more than i engage for , i assure you ." " but consider your daughters . : 17.99432889255064
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them . : 19.160552022466547
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers . : 9.924748302972503
i dare say mr . : 50.20505000937039
lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane , nor half so good humoured as lydia . : 15.185316604070163
but you are always giving _her_ the preference ." " they have none of them much to recommend them ," replied he ; " they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters ." " mr . : 10.31928953333861
you take delight in vexing me . : 28.63000790699196
i have a high respect for your nerves . : 26.7837998985626
i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least ." " ah ! : 13.041657009467881
you do not know what i suffer ." " but i hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood ." " it will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them ." " depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , i will visit them all ." mr . : 11.13728228770773
bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character . : 9.474023840208213
_her_ mind was less difficult to develope . : 20.11896170714968
she was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper . : 18.531949281210043
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous . : 18.209221080298462
the business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its solace was visiting and news . : 15.143478950343557
chapter ii . : 107.29272991163054
bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr . : 14.385493026375633
bingley . : 1160.213744558077
he had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it . : 16.084229715642504
it was then disclosed in the following manner . : 37.96337105107717
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " i hope mr . : 10.348648268698168
bingley will like it lizzy ." " we are not in a way to know _what_ mr . : 21.624107921911182
long has promised to introduce him ." " i do not believe mrs . : 15.008845570488262
long will do any such thing . : 34.88763673005147
she has two nieces of her own . : 43.364510958551534
she is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and i have no opinion of her ." " no more have i ," said mr . : 16.6089787909505
bennet ; " and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you ." mrs . : 18.31334909977163
bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters . : 17.36938361931423
" don ' t keep coughing so , kitty , for heaven ' s sake ! : 17.233087673425135
have a little compassion on my nerves . : 31.188118347899575
you tear them to pieces ." " kitty has no discretion in her coughs ," said her father ; " she times them ill ." " i do not cough for my own amusement ," replied kitty fretfully . : 11.607311300965682
" when is your next ball to be , lizzy ?" " to - morrow fortnight ." " aye , so it is ," cried her mother , " and mrs . : 17.58224688053174
long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself ." " then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce mr . : 18.910039417069274
bingley to _her_ ." " impossible , mr . : 29.363688548632343
bennet , impossible , when i am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teazing ?" " i honour your circumspection . : 12.067120141015952
a fortnight ' s acquaintance is certainly very little . : 34.6666758791682
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . : 27.181368357125667
but if _we_ do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , mrs . : 15.401286111442618
long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , i will take it on myself ." the girls stared at their father . : 12.941449684933685
bennet said only , " nonsense , nonsense !" " what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ?" cried he . : 15.318570213284893
" do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ? : 17.76447290584842
i cannot quite agree with you _there_ . : 32.646392740042735
what say you , mary ? : 91.39867675567822
for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know , and read great books , and make extracts ." mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how . : 13.227356898403
" while mary is adjusting her ideas ," he continued , " let us return to mr . : 12.187681444414348
bingley ," cried his wife . : 50.67940525869127
" i am sorry to hear _that_ ; but why did not you tell me so before ? : 20.753568301596122
it is very unlucky ; but as i have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now ." the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of mrs . : 13.247614295478412
bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while . : 13.98551199991333
" how good it was in you , my dear mr . : 28.34511798226514
but i knew i should persuade you at last . : 32.97265338410359
i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . : 13.381771741696218
well , how pleased i am ! : 60.100915977872795
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now ." " now , kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse ," said mr . : 13.438527870386444
bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . : 23.452231524399526
" what an excellent father you have , girls ," said she , when the door was shut . : 16.90723900359985
" i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter . : 15.061954522013773
at our time of life , it is not so pleasant i can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing . : 15.560911348910036
lydia , my love , though you _are_ the youngest , i dare say mr . : 14.860589444651358
bingley will dance with you at the next ball ." " oh !" said lydia stoutly , " i am not afraid ; for though i _am_ the youngest , i ' m the tallest ." the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr . : 9.315061152246061
bennet ' s visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner . : 23.5298755730307
bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr . : 12.3653689458667
they attacked him in various ways ; with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises ; but he eluded the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second - hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas . : 9.056972526656601
sir william had been delighted with him . : 33.545502082236204
he was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party . : 14.000191267854232
nothing could be more delightful ! : 52.61784023620979
to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of mr . : 14.741751177207203
bingley ' s heart were entertained . : 25.69996357494557
bennet to her husband , " and all the others equally well married , i shall have nothing to wish for ." in a few days mr . : 19.202779549543155
bennet ' s visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library . : 21.303471405811877
he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father . : 14.74728479213309
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse . : 8.273109583110497
bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , & c . : 15.52731804079424
she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be . : 12.371483019003133
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that mr . : 10.401588122925192
bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly . : 19.2228611804098
and when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ; mr . : 15.23171855441377
bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man . : 32.09317066301196
bingley was good looking and gentleman - like ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners . : 12.993969816007253
his sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion . : 14.144570136481773
his brother - in - law , mr . : 16.09589086925419
hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend mr . : 17.338450275900108
darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien ; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year . : 10.213784477086955
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr . : 19.343503342658604
bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . : 10.338403406190723
such amiable qualities must speak for themselves . : 22.585486433058794
what a contrast between him and his friend ! : 32.29137479405968
darcy danced only once with mrs . : 26.427584428116447
hurst and once with miss bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party . : 10.996406722848025
his character was decided . : 63.82474263040629
amongst the most violent against him was mrs . : 15.423063694620215
bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters . : 16.218356763029377
elizabeth bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , mr . : 16.647585705237635
darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr . : 13.906398343915331
" come , darcy ," said he , " i must have you dance . : 23.40954165197015
you had much better dance ." " i certainly shall not . : 30.680354556915365
you know how i detest it , unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner . : 21.779134884210645
at such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable . : 26.44158729545452
your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with ." " i would not be so fastidious as you are ," cried bingley , " for a kingdom ! : 16.35754673942697
upon my honour , i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as i have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty ." " _you_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room ," said mr . : 12.29872677991657
darcy , looking at the eldest miss bennet . : 38.79898778270396
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld ! : 24.86670356551409
do let me ask my partner to introduce you ." " which do you mean ?" and turning round , he looked for a moment at elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , " she is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_ ; and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . : 9.71971969906579
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me ." mr . : 12.948920293531446
bingley followed his advice . : 53.91216413281585
darcy walked off ; and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him . : 14.791278448057758
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous . : 13.552917779196871
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family . : 22.63834745592706
bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party . : 18.462875609996136
bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters . : 22.106614408730827
jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a quieter way . : 24.52237256961903
elizabeth felt jane ' s pleasure . : 47.91568477730695
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball . : 13.316862870040428
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants . : 19.660911324352554
they found mr . : 107.89971055757078
bennet still up . : 104.5219150948821
with a book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations . : 13.666736145395411
he had rather hoped that all his wife ' s views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear . : 17.545556727547538
my dear mr . : 67.20587039254718
bennet ," as she entered the room , " we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball . : 19.553630164149073
i wish you had been there . : 54.20226846841018
jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . : 24.500476369784305
bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice . : 23.622213809628654
only think of _that_ my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . : 15.205402129125856
first of all , he asked miss lucas . : 52.561519762436866
then , the two third he danced with miss king , and the two fourth with maria lucas , and the two fifth with jane again , and the two sixth with lizzy , and the boulanger ----" " if he had had any compassion for _me_ ," cried her husband impatiently , " he would not have danced half so much ! : 11.574025415496637
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance !" " oh ! : 15.7830788627644
bennet , " i am quite delighted with him . : 24.209554652769423
he is so excessively handsome ! : 53.48317024289877
i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses . : 14.420372030582657
i dare say the lace upon mrs . : 17.78141869228733
hurst ' s gown ----" here she was interrupted again . : 19.85842101781252
bennet protested against any description of finery . : 18.995234214275484
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of mr . : 11.16727907594399
" but i can assure you ," she added , " that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . : 9.904225243529861
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him ! : 18.54079912653235
he walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! : 25.137967835286233
not handsome enough to dance with ! : 48.174398489932656
i wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set downs . : 23.27780511879176
i quite detest the man ." chapter iv . : 24.793586573801438
when jane and elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of mr . : 18.760600948180944
bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him . : 19.247855175684457
" he is just what a young man ought to be ," said she , " sensible , good humoured , lively ; and i never saw such happy manners !-- so much ease , with such perfect good breeding !" " he is also handsome ," replied elizabeth , " which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can . : 11.615188776011365
his character is thereby complete ." " i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . : 15.485181046285149
i did not expect such a compliment ." " did not you ? : 35.58709690645526
_i_ did for you . : 39.81323791971468
but that is one great difference between us . : 25.79327501220046
compliments always take _you_ by surprise , and _me_ never . : 14.465081978091277
he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . : 10.62972888898684
no thanks to his gallantry for that . : 43.63559859628833
you have liked many a stupider person ." " dear lizzy !" " oh ! : 16.82209596989905
you are a great deal too apt you know , to like people in general . : 18.430269345037594
you never see a fault in any body . : 30.28707798286014
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes . : 19.79013461332451
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life ." " i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one ; but i always speak what i think ." " i know you do ; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder . : 12.267632446360565
with _your_ good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! : 16.734531235589557
affectation of candour is common enough ;-- one meets it every where . : 6.255123567365749
but to be candid without ostentation or design -- to take the good of every body ' s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad -- belongs to you alone . : 12.512057442520533
and so , you like this man ' s sisters too , do you ? : 29.66387100837882
their manners are not equal to his ." " certainly not ; at first . : 27.38023523033735
but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . : 21.53369561961239
miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her ." elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them . : 10.510923327472721
they were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited . : 11.245998806961477
they were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others . : 10.368626226720155
they were of a respectable family in the north of england ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother ' s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade . : 10.91556170089324
bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase . : 11.590785735513778
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was mrs . : 11.920149225439921
hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . : 10.36179940726905
bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house . : 12.984247647826725
he did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately . : 13.480368708545926
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character .-- bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied . : 9.366085574163346
on the strength of darcy ' s regard bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion . : 14.549429896982774
in understanding darcy was the superior . : 65.83773303693027
bingley was by no means deficient , but darcy was clever . : 21.644411831164394
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage . : 23.02490199391889
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic . : 17.254830351892018
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful . : 11.759483776931315
chapter v . : 107.29272991163054
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate . : 10.908611699637747
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king , during his mayoralty . : 9.876340064571579
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly . : 16.83985049977855
it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton , denominated from that period lucas lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world . : 10.3062764888616
for though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body . : 13.611036034296305
by nature inoffensive , friendly and obliging , his presentation at st . : 10.127695429330014
james ' s had made him courteous . : 22.668526011105705
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs . : 13.091049178009944
bennet .-- they had several children . : 36.29993525648512
the eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty - seven , was elizabeth ' s intimate friend . : 15.892374318989257
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate . : 12.746248880069206
" _you_ began the evening well , charlotte ," said mrs . : 23.988540960986455
bennet with civil self - command to miss lucas . : 19.59437975419594
" _you_ were mr . : 61.230584252562736
bingley ' s first choice ." " yes ;-- but he seemed to like his second better ." " oh !-- you mean jane , i suppose -- because he danced with her twice . : 12.161393784437054
to be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her -- indeed i rather believe he _did_ -- i heard something about it -- but i hardly know what -- something about mr . : 9.523098760279437
robinson ." " perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr . : 13.439936542396973
robinson ' s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and _which_ he thought the prettiest ? : 11.370615666057626
and his answering immediately to the last question -- oh ! : 23.56679861809757
" mr . : 230.08363945711505
long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips ." " are you quite sure , ma ' am ?-- is not there a little mistake ?" said jane .--" i certainly saw mr . : 9.200701559506953
darcy speaking to her ." " aye -- because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield , and he could not help answering her ;-- but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to ." " miss bingley told me ," said jane , " that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance . : 11.278972348654678
with _them_ he is remarkably agreeable ." " i do not believe a word of it , my dear . : 17.646152130855636
if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs . : 20.2732527363383
long . : 945.5427473492525
but i can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs . : 13.309583503130236
long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise ." " i do not mind his not talking to mrs . : 13.237661419175769
long ," said miss lucas , " but i wish he had danced with eliza ." " another time , lizzy ," said her mother , " i would not dance with _him_ , if i were you ." " i believe , ma ' am , i may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him ." " his pride ," said miss lucas , " does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it . : 11.100806152427946
one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself . : 14.391797044827326
by all that i have ever read , i am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self - complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . : 10.801497439523994
vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonimously . : 9.567362299717635
a person may be proud without being vain . : 30.03915149455583
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us ." " if i were as rich as mr . : 10.88275721040913
darcy ," cried a young lucas who came with his sisters , " i should not care how proud i was . : 16.457079011352217
bennet ; " and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly ." the boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit . : 13.473952307340074
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield . : 21.09847741778899
the visit was returned in due form . : 25.28681150608672
miss bennet ' s pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs . : 16.442237656304595
hurst and miss bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ , was expressed towards the two eldest . : 13.565883626083933
it was generally evident whenever they met , that he _did_ admire her ; and to _her_ it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent . : 12.179833431213833
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas . : 39.06614676037592
" it may perhaps be pleasant ," replied charlotte , " to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded . : 14.801027623336546
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . : 11.803329047208035
in nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels . : 14.3918475904394
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on ." " but she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . : 14.652409414962547
if _i_ can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too ." " remember , eliza , that he does not know jane ' s disposition as you do ." " but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out ." " perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . : 13.163426350733168
but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together . : 9.730855657389432
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention . : 15.065972956828112
as yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness . : 24.456323267053282
she danced four dances with him at meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times . : 14.331502893494074
had she merely _dined_ with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together -- and four evenings may do a great deal ." " yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt - un better than commerce ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , i do not imagine that much has been unfolded ." " well ," said charlotte , " i wish jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to - morrow , i should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . : 9.266572194346544
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance . : 12.610074830108223
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before - hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least . : 11.665742704191127
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life ." " you make me laugh , charlotte ; but it is not sound . : 11.081380827402553
you know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself ." occupied in observing mr . : 15.219903774849977
bingley ' s attentions to her sister , elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend . : 14.433275277985116
but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes . : 12.312744236244205
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying . : 21.344184471635153
though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness . : 10.435606442734388
of this she was perfectly unaware ;-- to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with . : 14.968598506955821
he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others . : 21.128304369110456
it was at sir william lucas ' s , where a large party were assembled . : 17.629659791950786
" what does mr . : 70.60464040183524
darcy mean ," said she to charlotte , " by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ?" " that is a question which mr . : 14.60569275329134
darcy only can answer ." " but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about . : 15.58445470892969
he has a very satirical eye , and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself , i shall soon grow afraid of him ." on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " did not you think , mr . : 12.018592029433693
" i am going to open the instrument , eliza , and you know what follows ." " you are a very strange creature by way of a friend !-- always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body !-- if my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers ." on miss lucas ' s persevering , however , she added , " very well ; if it must be so , it must ." and gravely glancing at mr . : 9.726773559140433
darcy , " there is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with --' keep your breath to cool your porridge ,'-- and i shall keep mine to swell my song ." her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital . : 7.3569110417081
after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display . : 11.68914285111914
mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached . : 9.07210838746913
elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room . : 9.386766383193144
darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour , till sir william thus began . : 11.290008794351289
" what a charming amusement for young people this is , mr . : 18.002393119531536
darcy !-- there is nothing like dancing after all .-- i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies ." " certainly , sir ;-- and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world .-- every savage can dance ." sir william only smiled . : 9.053380378649846
" your friend performs delightfully ;" he continued after a pause , on seeing bingley join the group ;--" and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , mr . : 9.510692119654943
darcy ." " you saw me dance at meryton , i believe , sir ." " yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight . : 14.642052927123581
do you often dance at st . : 23.952962449132883
james ' s ?" " never , sir ." " do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ?" " it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it ." " you have a house in town , i conclude ?" mr . : 14.08289993159488
darcy bowed . : 357.54795915837985
" i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself -- for i am fond of superior society ; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas ." he paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her , " my dear miss eliza , why are not you dancing ?-- mr . : 10.359134693482892
darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to sir william , " indeed , sir , i have not the least intention of dancing .-- i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner ." mr . : 11.956767370567478
darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ; but in vain . : 17.491982266290464
elizabeth was determined ; nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion . : 11.667730894576108
" you excel so much in the dance , miss eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , i am sure , to oblige us for one half hour ." " mr . : 11.109138010889158
darcy is all politeness ," said elizabeth , smiling . : 26.584746670591095
" he is indeed -- but considering the inducement , my dear miss eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ?" elizabeth looked archly , and turned away . : 11.89354189975034
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by miss bingley , " i can guess the subject of your reverie ." " i should imagine not ." " you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner -- in such society ; and indeed i am quite of your opinion . : 12.6153393371837
i was never more annoyed ! : 43.61142629965739
my mind was more agreeably engaged . : 39.80392760178255
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow ." miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections . : 10.132120800936457
" i am all astonishment . : 49.656837639386445
how long has she been such a favourite ?-- and pray when am i to wish you joy ?" " that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask . : 11.659329998882095
a lady ' s imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment . : 13.423263082480991
i knew you would be wishing me joy ." " nay , if you are so serious about it , i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled . : 14.508498730379555
you will have a charming mother - in - law , indeed , and of course she will be always at pemberley with you ." he listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed long . : 11.481542392864066
chapter vii . : 107.29272991163054
bennet ' s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in default of heirs male , on a distant relation ; and their mother ' s fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his . : 9.211709491293096
her father had been an attorney in meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds . : 16.56372699313657
she had a sister married to a mr . : 35.27330308971256
philips , who had been a clerk to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade . : 15.112034329501077
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner ' s shop just over the way . : 10.951368727962283
the two youngest of the family , catherine and lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters ', and when nothing better offered , a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt . : 8.161945012855437
at present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and meryton was the head quarters . : 13.213554229449683
their visits to mrs . : 52.071750838523684
philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence . : 21.520861925078076
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers ' names and connections . : 14.654298676607864
they could talk of nothing but officers ; and mr . : 23.517452296219794
bingley ' s large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign . : 14.185114802571057
bennet coolly observed , " from all that i can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country . : 15.58775330505584
i have suspected it some time , but i am now convinced ." catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of captain carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to london . : 12.079920960491304
bennet , " that you should be so ready to think your own children silly . : 19.859740324387502
i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish ." " my dear mr . : 10.172667588979575
bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother .-- when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do . : 11.206977153728952
bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer . : 12.751791150703566
what is it about ? : 76.57723692518456
well , jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love ." " it is from miss bingley ," said jane , and then read it aloud . : 14.653205219408049
" my dear friend , " if you are not so compassionate as to dine to - day with louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day ' s tãªte - ã - tãªte between two women can never end without a quarrel . : 9.695003284399125
come as soon as you can on the receipt of this . : 27.542330521760146
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers . : 38.94849676613715
" i wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_ ." " dining out ," said mrs . : 16.345350176017597
bennet , " that is very unlucky ." " can i have the carriage ?" said jane . : 22.487933436073227
" no , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night ." " that would be a good scheme ," said elizabeth , " if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home ." " oh ! : 12.005211689867958
bingley ' s chaise to go to meryton ; and the hursts have no horses to theirs ." " i had much rather go in the coach ." " but , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , i am sure . : 11.40670269121546
they are wanted in the farm , mr . : 22.159885062582926
bennet , are not they ?" " they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them ." " but if you have got them to - day ," said elizabeth , " my mother ' s purpose will be answered ." she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged . : 12.286829344551576
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day . : 14.919256996710352
her hopes were answered ; jane had not been gone long before it rained hard . : 11.416128898901539
her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted . : 31.671008627682536
" this was a lucky idea of mine , indeed !" said mrs . : 21.308807453909022
bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own . : 19.625834193458555
till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance . : 18.37055332408827
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth : " my dearest lizzy , " i find myself very unwell this morning , which , i suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . : 9.656837907553445
my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better . : 20.648047258907912
they insist also on my seeing mr . : 21.930883926590596
" yours , & c ." " well , my dear ," said mr . : 17.00058705049644
bennet , when elizabeth had read the note aloud , " if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr . : 11.886976582984216
bingley , and under your orders ." " oh ! : 22.129616246373278
i am not at all afraid of her dying . : 34.98021192349568
people do not die of little trifling colds . : 19.940938791680182
she will be taken good care of . : 35.48412002099535
i would go and see her , if i could have the carriage ." elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse - woman , walking was her only alternative . : 15.269456628574645
she declared her resolution . : 92.57949386713443
you will not be fit to be seen when you get there ." " i shall be very fit to see jane -- which is all i want ." " is this a hint to me , lizzy ," said her father , " to send for the horses ?" " no , indeed . : 13.956527633015456
i do not wish to avoid the walk . : 32.496060331399
the distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles . : 19.849422802080735
i shall be back by dinner ." " i admire the activity of your benevolence ," observed mary , " but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required ." " we will go as far as meryton with you ," said catherine and lydia .-- elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together . : 9.646196828437319
" if we make haste ," said lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes ." in meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ' wives , and elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise . : 7.678443585124064
she was shewn into the breakfast - parlour , where all but jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise .-- that she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to mrs . : 11.646639956224847
hurst and miss bingley ; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it . : 14.170258737221138
she was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother ' s manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness .-- mr . : 13.155653419222025
darcy said very little , and mr . : 38.68460364321604
hurst nothing at all . : 42.560638820857456
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion ' s justifying her coming so far alone . : 14.221277278092597
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered . : 31.04532136478991
miss bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room . : 17.343289208061734
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance . : 13.926408429814702
elizabeth silently attended her . : 70.77087756161345
when breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane . : 13.61282954711783
the advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely . : 15.290460577124522
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere . : 14.118295153834874
when the clock struck three , elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very unwillingly said so . : 15.701257928231414
miss bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when jane testified such concern in parting with her , that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present . : 10.95663772852094
elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes . : 11.189843996540953
chapter viii . : 107.29272991163054
at five o ' clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner . : 9.940033086768334
to the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr . : 9.349605731491856
bingley ' s , she could not make a very favourable answer . : 21.855379452858507
the sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them , restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike . : 10.458528418142631
their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency . : 22.092263666373103
his anxiety for jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others . : 16.118128284841287
she had very little notice from any but him . : 20.909306391784
darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for mr . : 26.023935497459423
hurst , by whom elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her . : 9.992700723234636
when dinner was over , she returned directly to jane , and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room . : 16.285928103216264
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ; she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty . : 14.798591138332348
hurst thought the same , and added , " she has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . : 21.797454744242653
i shall never forget her appearance this morning . : 20.0045347517878
she really looked almost wild ." " she did indeed , louisa . : 22.63706889160992
i could hardly keep my countenance . : 35.76921306176251
very nonsensical to come at all ! : 53.634794908514294
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning . : 18.196912297486318
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice ." " _you_ observed it , mr . : 13.344689087597525
darcy , i am sure ," said miss bingley ; " and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition ." " certainly not ." " to walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! : 11.01721367438788
what could she mean by it ? : 44.31974196162139
it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum ." " it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing ," said bingley . : 11.513899900689161
" i am afraid , mr . : 26.938814693066345
hurst began again . : 57.87099025345329
but with such a father and mother , and such low connections , i am afraid there is no chance of it ." " i think i have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in meryton ." " yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near cheapside ." " that is capital ," added her sister , and they both laughed heartily . : 12.515192248492228
to this speech bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend ' s vulgar relations . : 10.207061337399084
with a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining - parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee . : 12.603020914926592
hurst looked at her with astonishment . : 32.59092581940503
" do you prefer reading to cards ?" said he ; " that is rather singular ." " miss eliza bennet ," said miss bingley , " despises cards . : 12.25979712560985
he immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded . : 15.801080173420385
" and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but i am an idle fellow , and though i have not many , i have more than i ever look into ." elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room . : 11.39723807553247
" i am astonished ," said miss bingley , " that my father should have left so small a collection of books .-- what a delightful library you have at pemberley , mr . : 11.250811559791776
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . : 12.191340176788163
charles , when you build _your_ house , i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley ." " i wish it may ." " but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take pemberley for a kind of model . : 11.382018481973626
there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire ." " with all my heart ; i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it ." " i am talking of possibilities , charles ." " upon my word , caroline , i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation ." elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card - table , and stationed herself between mr . : 8.739480629849867
" is miss darcy much grown since the spring ?" said miss bingley ; " will she be as tall as i am ?" " i think she will . : 14.373655699141343
she is now about miss elizabeth bennet ' s height , or rather taller ." " how i long to see her again ! : 15.21925602322695
i never met with anybody who delighted me so much . : 18.76250783258333
such a countenance , such manners ! : 43.26747714320254
and so extremely accomplished for her age ! : 39.19007790879246
her performance on the piano - forte is exquisite ." " it is amazing to me ," said bingley , " how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are ." " all young ladies accomplished ! : 13.29711851571461
my dear charles , what do you mean ?" " yes , all of them , i think . : 19.201890015275744
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished ." " your list of the common extent of accomplishments ," said darcy , " has too much truth . : 12.668307525000337
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse , or covering a skreen . : 9.110700236901522
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general . : 16.78957437467909
i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished ." " nor i , i am sure ," said miss bingley . : 12.979068521975854
" then ," observed elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman ." " yes ; i do comprehend a great deal in it ." " oh ! : 13.421859494039218
certainly ," cried his faithful assistant , " no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with . : 11.430083820316197
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved ." " all this she must possess ," added darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading ." " i am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women . : 9.841759248150094
i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_ ." " are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ?" " _i_ never saw such a woman . : 12.128151442334032
_i_ never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united ." mrs . : 14.317895081277069
hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when mr . : 8.89641279534054
as all conversation was thereby at an end , elizabeth soon afterwards left the room . : 15.212550241409176
" eliza bennet ," said miss bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , i dare say , it succeeds . : 13.770819537114651
whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable ." miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject . : 9.589290650697293
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her . : 22.1305279988395
bingley urged mr . : 89.10150198130624
jones ' s being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians . : 9.401025843543957
this , she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother ' s proposal ; and it was settled that mr . : 15.385736557076777
jones should be sent for early in the morning , if miss bennet were not decidedly better . : 16.487780877922766
bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable . : 20.95299042558587
they solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister . : 9.295859959576974
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister ' s room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr . : 14.377378808926416
bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters . : 19.676558490519238
in spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to longbourn , desiring her mother to visit jane , and form her own judgment of her situation . : 15.131235591514614
bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast . : 16.654429367707678
had she found jane in any apparent danger , mrs . : 20.223903307610527
bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield . : 12.54041615794135
she would not listen therefore to her daughter ' s proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable . : 12.50602093886481
after sitting a little while with jane , on miss bingley ' s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour . : 12.523784166151056
bingley met them with hopes that mrs . : 23.6097531816078
bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected . : 23.045144924970998
" indeed i have , sir ," was her answer . : 28.500062361426625
" she is a great deal too ill to be moved . : 23.784736702568978
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness ." " removed !" cried bingley . : 15.881362925034022
my sister , i am sure , will not hear of her removal ." " you may depend upon it , madam ," said miss bingley , with cold civility , " that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us ." mrs . : 11.92746203690641
bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments . : 34.428137079092366
" i am sure ," she added , " if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper i ever met with . : 12.407903644747465
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_ . : 20.975853110999587
you have a sweet room here , mr . : 23.07363272081973
bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk . : 16.788466970989692
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield . : 22.29051647197817
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope , though you have but a short lease ." " whatever i do is done in a hurry ," replied he ; " and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield , i should probably be off in five minutes . : 12.650701082131649
" you begin to comprehend me , do you ?" cried he , turning towards her . : 21.332422673694598
yes -- i understand you perfectly ." " i wish i might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful ." " that is as it happens . : 12.430638907831796
it does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours ." " lizzy ," cried her mother , " remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home ." " i did not know before ," continued bingley immediately , " that you were a studier of character . : 10.383840518635159
it must be an amusing study ." " yes ; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing . : 13.465164513970857
they have at least that advantage ." " the country ," said darcy , " can in general supply but few subjects for such a study . : 14.396191443418152
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society ." " but people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever ." " yes , indeed ," cried mrs . : 9.695052803621076
bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood . : 17.086795392851183
" i assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town ." every body was surprised ; and darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away . : 14.648247273437754
bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph . : 14.740346004509343
" i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the shops and public places . : 8.440071213046958
the country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , mr . : 20.283582064375302
but that gentleman ," looking at darcy , " seemed to think the country was nothing at all ." " indeed , mama , you are mistaken ," said elizabeth , blushing for her mother . : 15.784764678835685
" you quite mistook mr . : 42.034817093364104
he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true ." " certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger . : 13.235867896158641
i know we dine with four and twenty families ." nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance . : 10.608072939961364
his sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards mr . : 18.538257530259422
darcy with a very expressive smile . : 51.40201346013501
bingley -- is not he ? : 61.97182103580386
so much the man of fashion ! : 47.9851502577615
so genteel and so easy !-- he has always something to say to every body .-- _that_ is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter ." " did charlotte dine with you ?" " no , she would go home . : 9.902765908926595
i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies . : 25.739864723201997
for my part , mr . : 34.706593165001884
bingley , _i_ always keep servants that can do their own work ; _my_ daughters are brought up differently . : 7.87575428497498
but every body is to judge for themselves , and the lucases are very good sort of girls , i assure you . : 19.03831619095172
not that _i_ think charlotte so _very_ plain -- but then she is our particular friend ." " she seems a very pleasant young woman ," said bingley . : 10.741727199009118
dear , yes ;-- but you must own she is very plain . : 23.511474012199585
lady lucas herself has often said so , and envied me jane ' s beauty . : 15.961136927695172
i do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , jane -- one does not often see any body better looking . : 13.798739723215196
it is what every body says . : 43.26651519112446
i do not trust my own partiality . : 35.20746885937298
when she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner ' s in town , so much in love with her , that my sister - in - law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away . : 11.452279597288491
but however he did not . : 64.28877784895772
perhaps he thought her too young . : 30.829162564571526
however , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were ." " and so ended his affection ," said elizabeth impatiently . : 16.38512306794826
" there has been many a one , i fancy , overcome in the same way . : 23.511525294496586
i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love !" " i have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love ," said darcy . : 8.081624443798894
" of a fine , stout , healthy love it may . : 21.23704085848326
but if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away ." darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again . : 8.11554468667241
she longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence mrs . : 19.041667389458638
bennet began repeating her thanks to mr . : 17.73977039719679
bingley for his kindness to jane , with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy . : 14.689783554311882
bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required . : 14.5328068598036
she performed her part indeed without much graciousness , but mrs . : 14.916648888899747
bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage . : 25.523217023456926
upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward . : 18.6002480300924
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax mr . : 16.495386040757488
bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield . : 15.931475490827626
lydia was a stout , well - grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good - humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age . : 9.074825015065263
she had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self - consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle ' s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance . : 12.84112796522504
she was very equal therefore to address mr . : 18.2834622907014
bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it . : 15.33079630977423
" i am perfectly ready , i assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball . : 15.790528026674442
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill ." lydia declared herself satisfied . : 18.063905165251537
yes -- it would be much better to wait till jane was well , and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again . : 12.904043781466035
and when you have given _your_ ball ," she added , " i shall insist on their giving one also . : 12.361457103012146
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not ." mrs . : 14.937758126487873
bennet and her daughters then departed , and elizabeth returned instantly to jane , leaving her own and her relations ' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr . : 15.419497522579821
darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_ , in spite of all miss bingley ' s witticisms on _fine eyes_ . : 11.346976415869163
hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing - room . : 12.676072593744632
the loo table , however , did not appear . : 38.4138077918091
darcy was writing , and miss bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister . : 12.893853958590709
hurst and mr . : 51.085908616348476
bingley were at piquet , and mrs . : 32.33145446074632
the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand - writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each . : 12.363509884704843
" how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter !" he made no answer . : 18.475278913335885
" you write uncommonly fast ." " you are mistaken . : 21.46991250812049
i write rather slowly ." " how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year ! : 16.752645397747468
letters of business too ! : 31.322890337610097
how odious i should think them !" " it is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours ." " pray tell your sister that i long to see her ." " i have already told her so once , by your desire ." " i am afraid you do not like your pen . : 10.984410284901786
let me mend it for you . : 25.360128389488644
i mend pens remarkably well ." " thank you -- but i always mend my own ." " how can you contrive to write so even ?" he was silent . : 11.89249281477709
" tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley ' s ." " will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again ?-- at present i have not room to do them justice ." " oh ! : 10.548135542234677
it is of no consequence . : 57.67912863918604
but do you always write such charming long letters to her , mr . : 15.388243437493859
darcy ?" " they are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine ." " it is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill ." " that will not do for a compliment to darcy , caroline ," cried her brother --" because he does _not_ write with ease . : 11.100615611663034
he studies too much for words of four syllables .-- do not you , darcy ?" " my style of writing is very different from yours ." " oh !" cried miss bingley , " charles writes in the most careless way imaginable . : 10.782367944340294
he leaves out half his words , and blots the rest ." " my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them -- by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents ." " your humility , mr . : 8.441066654960991
bingley ," said elizabeth , " must disarm reproof ." " nothing is more deceitful ," said darcy , " than the appearance of humility . : 13.031337496381344
it is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast ." " and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty ?" " the indirect boast ;-- for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting . : 8.488196290854885
the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance . : 14.805784622680754
when you told mrs . : 45.366170341351115
bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself -- and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ?" " nay ," cried bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning . : 10.757351293441928
and yet , upon my honour , i believed what i said of myself to be true , and i believe it at this moment . : 21.19120814128495
at least , therefore , i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies ." " i dare say you believed it ; but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity . : 10.884180334012553
your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know ; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , ' bingley , you had better stay till next week ,' you would probably do it , you would probably not go -- and , at another word , might stay a month ." " you have only proved by this ," cried elizabeth , " that mr . : 11.304206434019154
bingley did not do justice to his own disposition . : 36.46784909085595
you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself ." " i am exceedingly gratified ," said bingley , " by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper . : 11.780210670053672
darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ?" " upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter , darcy must speak for himself ." " you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which i have never acknowledged . : 8.0250803565703
allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , miss bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety ." " to yield readily -- easily -- to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you ." " to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either ." " you appear to me , mr . : 9.535238741748529
darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection . : 19.254229867911793
a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it . : 9.625331473973139
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr . : 17.246833772189635
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ?" " will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ?" " by all means ," cried bingley ; " let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , miss bennet , than you may be aware of . : 9.305568660055638
i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do ." mr . : 12.881220417688285
darcy smiled ; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh . : 18.117911807760688
arguments are too much like disputes . : 21.597497869157458
darcy had much better finish his letter ." mr . : 18.7214582391315
darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter . : 24.360272370850755
when that business was over , he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music . : 19.34959113851009
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano - forte , and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself . : 10.265268852083786
darcy ' s eyes were fixed on her . : 27.600300975831054
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange . : 14.477932173994796
she could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present . : 9.469825394253377
after playing some italian songs , miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air ; and soon afterwards mr . : 9.937125212951424
darcy , drawing near elizabeth , said to her -- " do not you feel a great inclination , miss bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ?" she smiled , but made no answer . : 12.617289569339452
he repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence . : 28.732941997728243
you wanted me , i know , to say ' yes ,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt . : 12.283700968021915
i have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that i do not want to dance a reel at all -- and now despise me if you dare ." " indeed i do not dare ." elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her . : 11.644035645167174
miss bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth . : 13.411809768126407
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance . : 12.624517699981883
" i hope ," said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , " you will give your mother - in - law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after the officers .-- and , if i may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses ." " have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ?" " oh ! : 8.680422037896115
yes .-- do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley . : 11.795325769642643
put them next to your great uncle the judge . : 14.673230975961179
they are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lines . : 18.782136532129144
as for your elizabeth ' s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ?" " it would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye - lashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied ." at that moment they were met from another walk , by mrs . : 10.080344308177972
" i did not know that you intended to walk ," said miss bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard . : 17.059384344954275
" you used us abominably ill ," answered mrs . : 12.87257345909311
hurst , " in running away without telling us that you were coming out ." then taking the disengaged arm of mr . : 9.19038339502346
darcy , she left elizabeth to walk by herself . : 28.51158130218972
the path just admitted three . : 43.580221720648865
darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said ,-- " this walk is not wide enough for our party . : 11.117685595786298
we had better go into the avenue ." but elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , " no , no ; stay where you are .-- you are charmingly group ' d , and appear to uncommon advantage . : 11.145753983609383
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth . : 18.95291984200059
good bye ." she then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two . : 13.284553055657515
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening . : 10.917320833640373
when the ladies removed after dinner , elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing - room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared . : 9.813747191432151
their powers of conversation were considerable . : 28.49815039831423
they could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit . : 8.477498753956695
but when the gentlemen entered , jane was no longer the first object . : 26.274778290684313
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet , with a polite congratulation ; mr . : 15.363563851595613
hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad ;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley ' s salutation . : 10.838665269410944
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire - place , that she might be farther from the door . : 12.015669985226811
he then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else . : 24.02836895444157
elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight . : 17.96302897498089
when tea was over , mr . : 26.298571686368348
hurst reminded his sister - in - law of the card - table -- but in vain . : 12.10764987233662
she had obtained private intelligence that mr . : 17.766412438006952
darcy did not wish for cards ; and mr . : 32.24090754772055
hurst soon found even his open petition rejected . : 11.022061087407309
she assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her . : 16.944772498982825
hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep . : 12.956645476381498
darcy took up a book ; miss bingley did the same ; and mrs . : 18.859044000254883
hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother ' s conversation with miss bennet . : 9.997419592267736
miss bingley ' s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr . : 15.296155002186214
darcy ' s progress through _his_ book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page . : 11.975335317494904
she could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on . : 17.479994700293595
at length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , " how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! : 14.891260829735666
i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! : 20.12525954912067
how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book !-- when i have a house of my own , i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library ." no one made any reply . : 11.564997146146395
she then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , " by the bye , charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield ?-- i would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure ." " if you mean darcy ," cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins -- but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards ." " i should like balls infinitely better ," she replied , " if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting . : 9.651912743241763
it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day ." " much more rational , my dear caroline , i dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball ." miss bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room . : 10.743599153098774
her figure was elegant , and she walked well ;-- but darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious . : 15.90979014409119
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to elizabeth , said , " miss eliza bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room .-- i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude ." elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately . : 12.05747388847029
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; mr . : 18.680735668151986
darcy looked up . : 137.89862163990938
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book . : 14.237487710693449
he was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would interfere . : 9.66855286415395
" not at all ," was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it ." miss bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing mr . : 13.6663520933372
darcy in any thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives . : 19.155283238208533
" i have not the smallest objection to explaining them ," said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak . : 12.923446481543213
" you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ' s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ;-- if the first , i should be completely in your way ;-- and if the second , i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire ." " oh ! : 9.689226327701371
shocking !" cried miss bingley . : 31.482656546278122
how shall we punish him for such a speech ?" " nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination ," said elizabeth . : 14.688669546222933
" we can all plague and punish one another . : 14.343557912475642
teaze him -- laugh at him .-- intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done ." " but upon my honour i do _not_ . : 13.091081628737346
i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_ . : 17.450686595655775
teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind ! : 10.745927132325516
no , no -- i feel he may defy us there . : 21.10371856963982
darcy may hug himself ." " mr . : 22.584571828902014
" that is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon i hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance . : 14.144618552395716
i dearly love a laugh ." " miss bingley ," said he , " has given me credit for more than can be . : 15.511027492606758
the wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke ." " certainly ," replied elizabeth --" there are such people , but i hope i am not one of _them_ . : 12.336093588343655
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good . : 20.640455012456826
follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me , i own , and i laugh at them whenever i can .-- but these , i suppose , are precisely what you are without ." " perhaps that is not possible for any one . : 10.03602147776751
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule ." " such as vanity and pride ." " yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . : 9.982401227663564
but pride -- where there is a real superiority of mind , pride will be always under good regulation ." elizabeth turned away to hide a smile . : 10.349665614286561
darcy is over , i presume ," said miss bingley ;--" and pray what is the result ?" " i am perfectly convinced by it that mr . : 12.910258853179467
darcy has no defect . : 71.92691529739704
he owns it himself without disguise ." " no "-- said darcy , " i have made no such pretension . : 13.7585146886518
i have faults enough , but they are not , i hope , of understanding . : 29.55324589406707
my temper i dare not vouch for .-- it is i believe too little yielding -- certainly too little for the convenience of the world . : 11.195932056402212
i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought , nor their offences against myself . : 10.52722071869343
my temper would perhaps be called resentful .-- my good opinion once lost is lost for ever ." " _that_ is a failing indeed !"-- cried elizabeth . : 7.834274336195642
" implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character . : 18.815737110174606
but you have chosen your fault well .-- i really cannot _laugh_ at it . : 13.796279047701706
you are safe from me ." " there is , i believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome ." " and _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body ." " and yours ," he replied with a smile , " is wilfully to misunderstand them ." " do let us have a little music ,"-- cried miss bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share .--" louisa , you will not mind my waking mr . : 9.014935922457573
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention . : 19.487454215112546
chapter xii . : 107.29272991163054
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters , elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day . : 17.955511532216725
but mrs . : 250.82210729937236
bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday , which would exactly finish jane ' s week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before . : 11.582749991504295
her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to elizabeth ' s wishes , for she was impatient to get home . : 21.67539108608863
bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if mr . : 16.576720478758922
bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well .-- against staying longer , however , elizabeth was positively resolved -- nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged jane to borrow mr . : 9.20158337781162
bingley ' s carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made . : 13.371647435513509
the communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane ; and till the morrow , their going was deferred . : 10.28590014073676
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other . : 11.414463520163947
to mr . : 223.69125294360788
darcy it was welcome intelligence -- elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough . : 21.319426758948488
steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her . : 11.409711077169197
on sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place . : 17.984106637551747
miss bingley ' s civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former .-- elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits . : 11.56080988951367
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother . : 14.646318539335422
bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure jane would have caught cold again .-- but their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle . : 13.149411834867747
the evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of jane and elizabeth . : 17.116326610668974
they found mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread - bare morality to listen to . : 8.899007117879114
catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort . : 21.29268111749359
much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been flogged , and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married . : 13.086497117850577
chapter xiii . : 107.29272991163054
bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , " that you have ordered a good dinner to - day , because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party ." " who do you mean , my dear ? : 12.886817691988117
i know of nobody that is coming i am sure , unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in , and i hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her . : 11.300751343947814
i do not believe she often sees such at home ." " the person of whom i speak , is a gentleman and a stranger ." mrs . : 13.912985441122458
it is mr . : 109.31519092408142
bingley i am sure . : 82.01752206087387
why jane -- you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing ! : 12.894921027754364
well , i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr . : 15.932634835905963
bingley .-- but -- good lord ! : 27.876255589950347
how unlucky ! : 326.3489125836814
there is not a bit of fish to be got to - day . : 17.301416787586124
lydia , my love , ring the bell . : 22.62138722239026
bingley ," said her husband ; " it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life ." this roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once . : 12.891544522408342
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained . : 19.738015785415953
" about a month ago i received this letter , and about a fortnight ago i answered it , for i thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention . : 13.37191057013091
it is from my cousin , mr . : 37.40301463360844
my dear ," cried his wife , " i cannot bear to hear that mentioned . : 15.476891588730554
i do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and i am sure if i had been you , i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it ." jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail . : 11.918955002061198
bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about . : 8.833625783993966
" it certainly is a most iniquitous affair ," said mr . : 17.138973900765457
bennet , " and nothing can clear mr . : 24.971521134372473
collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn . : 23.952975947007076
i hate such false friends . : 38.87601748925786
why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ?" " why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear ." _hunsford , near westerham , kent , <NUM> th october . _ dear sir , the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since i have had the misfortune to lose him , i have frequently wished to heal the breach ; but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance .--" there , mrs . : 9.468514684659532
bennet ."-- my mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received ordination at easter , i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh , widow of sir lewis de bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england . : 7.241137547694425
as a clergyman , moreover , i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good - will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch . : 7.608415896635706
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends ,-- but of this hereafter . : 11.16277029844665
i remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well - wisher and friend , william collins ." " at four o ' clock , therefore , we may expect this peace - making gentleman ," said mr . : 8.12103856185416
bennet , as he folded up the letter . : 32.47921285964636
" he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ; and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again ." " there is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he is disposed to make them any amends , i shall not be the person to discourage him ." " though it is difficult ," said jane , " to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit ." elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required . : 9.395460098485913
" he must be an oddity , i think ," said she . : 27.516603989728267
" i cannot make him out .-- there is something very pompous in his style .-- and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail ?-- we cannot suppose he would help it , if he could .-- can he be a sensible man , sir ?" " no , my dear ; i think not . : 10.059094499493115
i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse . : 17.65469393107069
i am impatient to see him ." " in point of composition ," said mary , " his letter does not seem defective . : 17.736023916397038
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet i think it is well expressed ." to catherine and lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting . : 10.8187214023239
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour . : 13.995686399276778
as for their mother , mr . : 56.753854013296525
collins ' s letter had done away much of her ill - will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters . : 14.953423913853062
collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family . : 20.208649612743496
bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and mr . : 16.581070283510613
collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself . : 13.954091717484076
he was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty . : 14.53454357511011
his air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal . : 19.48945352141994
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs . : 16.734240175369695
bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage . : 11.472240008975124
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers , but mrs . : 25.81220353733404
bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily , " you are very kind , sir , i am sure ; and i wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough . : 11.211721730152405
things are settled so oddly ." " you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate ." " ah ! : 13.547704847900272
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess . : 19.95377072859982
not that i mean to find fault with _you_ , for such things i know are all chance in this world . : 17.096933055280143
there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed ." " i am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins ,-- and could say much on the subject , but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate . : 9.57555110899333
but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them . : 18.13910606785625
at present i will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted ----" he was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other . : 13.4567611935667
they were not the only objects of mr . : 26.965361163712327
collins ' s admiration . : 71.24817953960195
the hall , the dining - room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs . : 13.642750749081221
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its cookery was owing . : 13.029459803353863
but here he was set right by mrs . : 23.666957228908196
he begged pardon for having displeased her . : 24.438433831712906
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour . : 11.799207050802792
lady catherine de bourgh ' s attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable . : 13.862290706041236
collins was eloquent in her praise . : 34.14639940035226
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank -- such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from lady catherine . : 10.77243016107011
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her . : 12.25731284604091
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings , and had sent for him only the saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening . : 11.339923623108755
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew , but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her . : 9.97873862317803
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations . : 14.500694892284221
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself ,-- some shelves in the closets up stairs . : 8.965879914265994
" that is all very proper and civil , i am sure ," said mrs . : 12.857159374902485
does she live near you , sir ?" " the garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from rosings park , her ladyship ' s residence ." " i think you said she was a widow , sir ? : 11.144122925361852
has she any family ?" " she has one only daughter , the heiress of rosings , and of very extensive property ." " ah !" cried mrs . : 11.90167782188259
bennet , shaking her head , " then she is better off than many girls . : 16.12957879709378
is she handsome ?" " she is a most charming young lady indeed . : 20.89017839232848
lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth . : 10.238945083131927
she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them . : 8.967493469561743
i do not remember her name among the ladies at court ." " her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ; and by that means , as i told lady catherine myself one day , has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament . : 8.896326915078044
her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies . : 11.307802917014351
i have more than once observed to lady catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her .-- these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay ." " you judge very properly ," said mr . : 9.312110214498759
bennet , " and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy . : 15.12106988677489
may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ?" " they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible ." mr . : 7.802809228755005
bennet ' s expectations were fully answered . : 20.514097533743954
his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure . : 11.265845591348112
by tea - time however the dose had been enough , and mr . : 16.21757819935546
bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing - room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies . : 13.413035143039444
collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , ( for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library ,) he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read novels .-- kitty stared at him , and lydia exclaimed .-- other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose fordyce ' s sermons . : 8.837100286576767
lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , " do you know , mama , that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard , and if he does , colonel forster will hire him . : 9.988701939875696
my aunt told me so herself on saturday . : 26.746604161153325
i shall walk to meryton to - morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when mr . : 16.075075429539606
denny comes back from town ." lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but mr . : 7.387239779476965
it amazes me , i confess ;-- for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction . : 14.479183527099028
but i will no longer importune my young cousin ." then turning to mr . : 11.790805644071524
bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon . : 16.352330364066905
bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements . : 9.515549131288845
bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia ' s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but mr . : 13.239933983502873
collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with mr . : 8.606473775593697
bennet , and prepared for backgammon . : 38.35125472482991
chapter xv . : 107.29272991163054
the subjection in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self - conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity . : 9.89029780383296
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self - importance and humility . : 9.876891708332538
having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report . : 11.423761860104054
this was his plan of amends -- of atonement -- for inheriting their father ' s estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part . : 10.097501675592774
his plan did not vary on seeing them .-- miss bennet ' s lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice . : 10.196115143123398
the next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour ' s tãªte - ã - tãªte with mrs . : 11.19030446197971
bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage - house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very jane he had fixed on .--" as to her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say -- she could not positively answer -- but she did not _know_ of any prepossession ;-- her _eldest_ daughter , she must just mention -- she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged ." mr . : 10.08551470760105
collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth -- and it was soon done -- done while mrs . : 14.371122040280163
elizabeth , equally next to jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course . : 13.74746999740626
bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good graces . : 14.811189265312818
lydia ' s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten ; every sister except mary agreed to go with her ; and mr . : 12.66621696056385
collins was to attend them , at the request of mr . : 24.64139982799497
bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither mr . : 16.062867657839035
collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to mr . : 11.318202193114935
bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at hunsford . : 18.80337986485863
such doings discomposed mr . : 39.33091970729667
bennet exceedingly . : 361.47353595907515
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting mr . : 12.226000272412637
collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and mr . : 20.304978805044893
collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go . : 12.010597055087402
in pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered meryton . : 13.524296975365582
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_ . : 21.529263805330153
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them . : 10.974717572412244
the officer was the very mr . : 73.32998669217943
all were struck with the stranger ' s air , all wondered who he could be , and kitty and lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot . : 9.13060149538534
denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , mr . : 11.8529605238422
his appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address . : 17.898001251184493
bingley was the principal spokesman , and miss bennet the principal object . : 27.784999940323658
he was then , he said , on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her . : 22.463284961934626
darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting . : 13.47718103491666
both changed colour , one looked white , the other red . : 16.65490864070747
wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat -- a salutation which mr . : 8.537118522263633
darcy just deigned to return . : 43.26912834625342
what could be the meaning of it ?-- it was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know . : 17.476124015486935
in another minute mr . : 62.04367307883205
bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend . : 12.256897988125427
denny and mr . : 38.63603434774768
wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr . : 25.008484854755853
philips ' s house , and then made their bows , in spite of miss lydia ' s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of mrs . : 12.180469325889037
philips ' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation . : 12.974640959596423
philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see mr . : 12.030057224408921
collins by jane ' s introduction of him . : 27.634755944404702
she received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice . : 12.70168397046227
philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that mr . : 8.448918048798726
she had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had mr . : 17.53544161363585
wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become " stupid , disagreeable fellows ." some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr . : 9.536036317733029
wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from longbourn would come in the evening . : 17.88726714790686
this was agreed to , and mrs . : 41.011170824199645
philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards . : 9.989652918163419
the prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits . : 16.36439080592191
collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless . : 9.634694326131026
as they walked home , elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister . : 12.09184758803843
bennet by admiring mrs . : 42.06448788902113
he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before . : 11.831546107606062
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life . : 18.294015741234954
as no objection was made to the young people ' s engagement with their aunt , and all mr . : 19.9355034676858
collins ' s scruples of leaving mr . : 20.021053636349688
bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing - room , that mr . : 9.597200372318953
wickham had accepted their uncle ' s invitation , and was then in the house . : 23.41424439093081
when this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , mr . : 14.943407416456377
collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when mrs . : 10.073506172677165
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in mrs . : 11.195518601056321
philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could . : 11.713680919979556
to the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle - piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long . : 12.67939864898464
it was over at last however . : 53.293505212974004
the gentlemen did approach ; and when mr . : 29.06555240784511
wickham walked into the room , elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration . : 14.720248489564419
the officers of the ---- shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman - like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but mr . : 15.231425553151194
wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread - bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker . : 8.910086473372507
with such rivals for the notice of the fair , as mr . : 27.186290469480493
wickham and the officers , mr . : 46.01974654627762
collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs . : 9.496003288565086
when the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist . : 12.325553443232014
" i know little of the game , at present ," said he , " but i shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life ----" mrs . : 15.491184505725775
philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason . : 19.80165291043895
wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia . : 13.624965437505056
at first there seemed danger of lydia ' s engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in particular . : 8.935833427717125
allowing for the common demands of the game , mr . : 16.087008674231047
wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with mr . : 15.59656835889232
she dared not even mention that gentleman . : 27.646252160031594
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved . : 30.621364103287625
he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long mr . : 9.900724019593843
darcy had been staying there . : 55.15995634618521
" about a month ," said elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , " he is a man of very large property in derbyshire , i understand ." " yes ," replied wickham ;--" his estate there is a noble one . : 11.830715290303944
a clear ten thousand per annum . : 30.808224695514763
you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself -- for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy ." elizabeth could not but look surprised . : 10.642250336619128
" you may well be surprised , miss bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday .-- are you much acquainted with mr . : 11.351924175190067
darcy ?" " as much as i ever wish to be ," cried elizabeth warmly ,--" i have spent four days in the same house with him , and i think him very disagreeable ." " i have no right to give _my_ opinion ," said wickham , " as to his being agreeable or otherwise . : 14.173716887249697
i am not qualified to form one . : 23.560426819489457
i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge . : 17.785308548553257
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish -- and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else .-- here you are in your own family ." " upon my word i say no more _here_ than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except netherfield . : 10.728589118342475
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire . : 35.03605806059302
every body is disgusted with his pride . : 27.139650363616454
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one ." " i cannot pretend to be sorry ," said wickham , after a short interruption , " that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with _him_ i believe it does not often happen . : 11.556504004174949
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen ." " i should take him , even on _my_ slight acquaintance , to be an ill - tempered man ." wickham only shook his head . : 10.7133687119661
" i wonder ," said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is likely to be in this country much longer ." " i do not at all know ; but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield . : 16.358166249180666
no -- it is not for _me_ to be driven away by mr . : 20.460526907206205
if _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_ , he must go . : 21.20006389300429
we are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but i have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what i might proclaim to all the world ; a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is . : 11.188851591127483
his father , miss bennet , the late mr . : 35.40798800945631
darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend i ever had ; and i can never be in company with this mr . : 14.741309445317567
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father ." elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry . : 11.541674005843939
wickham began to speak on more general topics , meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry . : 13.517557495398233
" it was the prospect of constant society , and good society ," he added , " which was my chief inducement to enter the ---- shire . : 13.356551327698508
i knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them . : 11.130107498289542
society , i own , is necessary to me . : 38.638622486198116
i _must_ have employment and society . : 25.627301848555046
a military life is not what i was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible . : 20.76430970649366
the church _ought_ to have been my profession -- i was brought up for the church , and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now ." " indeed !" " yes -- the late mr . : 12.01002227919472
darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift . : 24.883134657451407
he was my godfather , and excessively attached to me . : 25.30122953020665
i cannot do justice to his kindness . : 37.952997781608126
he meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere ." " good heavens !" cried elizabeth ; " but how could _that_ be ?-- how could his will be disregarded ?-- why did not you seek legal redress ?" " there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law . : 10.65847548580236
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but mr . : 18.387933084119698
darcy chose to doubt it -- or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing . : 9.683046299842067
certain it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as i was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it . : 12.455588320154824
i have a warm , unguarded temper , and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him , and _to_ him , too freely . : 12.549468344264968
but the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me ." " this is quite shocking !-- he deserves to be publicly disgraced ." " some time or other he _will_ be -- but it shall not be by _me_ . : 13.007345713851318
till i can forget his father , i can never defy or expose _him_ ." elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them . : 11.782667542394917
" but what ," said she , after a pause , " can have been his motive ?-- what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ?" " a thorough , determined dislike of me -- a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy . : 9.436987786589638
had the late mr . : 56.07146377712237
darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father ' s uncommon attachment to me , irritated him i believe very early in life . : 12.425675478568506
darcy so bad as this -- though i have never liked him , i had not thought so very ill of him -- i had supposed him to be despising his fellow - creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this !" after a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " i _do_ remember his boasting one day , at netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper . : 10.088152260740019
philips , appears to do so much credit to -- but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr . : 14.030270980582642
darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property . : 31.617140466148516
he was most highly esteemed by mr . : 23.70499817308413
darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend . : 25.03712408326191
darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ , as of affection to myself ." " how strange !" cried elizabeth . : 12.400516770903113
darcy has not made him just to you !-- if from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest ,-- for dishonesty i must call it ." " it _is_ wonderful ,"-- replied wickham ,--" for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ;-- and pride has often been his best friend . : 7.671355662544158
it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling . : 13.428253520807587
but we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger impulses even than pride ." " can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ?" " yes . : 12.073542452341076
it has often led him to be liberal and generous ,-- to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor . : 11.70335027776147
not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the pemberley house , is a powerful motive . : 15.317729652524331
he has also _brotherly_ pride , which with _some_ brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers ." " what sort of a girl is miss darcy ?" he shook his head .--" i wish i could call her amiable . : 8.895458857353216
it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy . : 24.621710067592623
but she is nothing to me now . : 73.39097769706231
she is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and i understand highly accomplished . : 15.560514474464052
since her father ' s death , her home has been london , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education ." after many pauses and many trials of other subjects , elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying , " i am astonished at his intimacy with mr . : 10.264790636719226
bingley ! : 3164.9451175558966
how can mr . : 85.22756284170927
bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , i really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? : 17.714635199534342
how can they suit each other ?-- do you know mr . : 18.772214603728518
he cannot know what mr . : 50.62627073313193
darcy is ." " probably not ;-- but mr . : 24.278202206109434
darcy can please where he chuses . : 30.895811840210715
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while . : 15.001292872523017
among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous . : 16.704675790473267
his pride never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal - minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable ,-- allowing something for fortune and figure ." the whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and mr . : 8.173800838420021
philips .-- the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter . : 19.10581709853769
it had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when mrs . : 19.521148624969875
philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy . : 12.490562828635683
" i know very well , madam ," said he , " that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things ,-- and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object . : 10.578030831803714
there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh , i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters ." mr . : 9.54617572550589
wickham ' s attention was caught ; and after observing mr . : 17.776660234430764
i hardly know how mr . : 48.46559870867575
darcy ." " no , indeed , i did not .-- i knew nothing at all of lady catherine ' s connections . : 19.534011259300748
vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self - destined to another . : 10.686753882510288
collins ," said she , " speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , i suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman ." " i believe her to be both in a great degree ," replied wickham ; " i have not seen her for many years , but i very well remember that i never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent . : 11.587668557947886
she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class ." elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr . : 9.452526136109809
wickham ' s attentions . : 65.08928012621166
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs . : 23.10561509751387
philips ' s supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body . : 20.70423596942563
whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done gracefully . : 19.22222150206585
elizabeth went away with her head full of him . : 40.76002072268796
wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither lydia nor mr . : 17.005140573812568
collins were once silent . : 42.99109634506456
collins , in describing the civility of mr . : 18.915157876141205
philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house . : 9.50856253483229
chapter xvii . : 107.29272991163054
elizabeth related to jane the next day , what had passed between mr . : 18.517303206198655
wickham and herself . : 91.33020409426534
jane listened with astonishment and concern ;-- she knew not how to believe that mr . : 12.416908588108928
" they have both ," said she , " been deceived , i dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea . : 13.93765479528137
interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other . : 13.30399821002598
my dearest lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr . : 12.010457311668658
darcy , to be treating his father ' s favourite in such a manner ,-- one , whom his father had promised to provide for .-- it is impossible . : 13.673062040745986
no man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it . : 17.68424867495523
can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? : 17.074426271184162
oh ! : 364.314235500234
no ." " i can much more easily believe mr . : 25.972536555816834
bingley ' s being imposed on , than that mr . : 19.196047001983803
wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony .-- if it be not so , let mr . : 9.05859960996035
darcy contradict it . : 102.10120552572084
besides , there was truth in his looks ." " it is difficult indeed -- it is distressing .-- one does not know what to think ." " i beg your pardon ;-- one knows exactly what to think ." but jane could think with certainty on only one point ,-- that mr . : 8.327892332442818
bingley , if he _had been_ imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public . : 14.282158090290098
bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield , which was fixed for the following tuesday . : 14.550943420197747
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation . : 11.032892976221227
to the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding mrs . : 13.68559703534347
bennet as much as possible , saying not much to elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others . : 22.564780464256593
they were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs . : 9.343955458867766
bennet ' s civilities . : 75.8117531783914
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family . : 21.903454990897423
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr . : 14.879264365818605
wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr . : 18.801905232044966
darcy ' s looks and behaviour . : 32.45008206918699
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr . : 10.41985796074715
wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball . : 15.29122012661311
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it . : 18.5251329767273
" while i can have my mornings to myself ," said she , " it is enough .-- i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . : 11.20034072035363
collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr . : 14.416207001964974
bingley ' s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ' s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop , or lady catherine de bourgh , by venturing to dance . : 10.55842325171498
" i am by no means of opinion , i assure you ," said he , " that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours , miss elizabeth , for the two first dances especially ,-- a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her ." elizabeth felt herself completely taken in . : 10.774339005137849
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances :-- and to have mr . : 10.422704611175723
collins instead ! : 301.47726691081067
her liveliness had been never worse timed . : 33.37499408855221
there was no help for it however . : 30.01760532247717
collins ' s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could . : 14.815166583387107
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more .-- it now first struck her , that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors . : 8.945143081571917
collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him . : 16.454974456504722
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once . : 13.116534209168863
no aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ;-- the very shoe - roses for netherfield were got by proxy . : 9.231670985489696
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr . : 11.125807111012817
wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday and monday , endurable to kitty and lydia . : 9.87651676012887
till elizabeth entered the drawing - room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr . : 12.14981150597465
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her . : 11.405310320618042
she had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening . : 13.223530142871983
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr . : 11.878574566186767
darcy ' s pleasure in the bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr . : 14.920952223800134
denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , " i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here ." this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham ' s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .-- attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham . : 9.335748455805732
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr . : 12.930775204837937
the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification . : 12.38895426937413
collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give . : 8.476614613775853
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy . : 33.77546160959417
she danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked . : 18.61602924124065
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr . : 12.906944951649685
darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him . : 19.389453715240045
he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; charlotte tried to console her . : 12.078453927034323
" i dare say you will find him very agreeable ." " heaven forbid !-- _that_ would be the greatest misfortune of all !-- to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate !-- do not wish me such an evil ." when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence . : 8.61035636241405
darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it . : 11.671634068395198
they stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance . : 11.342189416042723
darcy .-- _i_ talked about the dance , and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples ." he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said . : 12.873376407906575
" very well .-- that reply will do for the present .-- perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones .-- but _now_ we may be silent ." " do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ?" " sometimes . : 8.688095751437418
one must speak a little , you know . : 41.20870993197903
it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of _some_ , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible ." " are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ?" " both ," replied elizabeth archly ; " for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds .-- we are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb ." " this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure ," said he . : 9.744126131287217
" how near it may be to _mine_ , i cannot pretend to say .-- _you_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly ." " i must not decide on my own performance ." he made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton . : 11.381642039122678
she answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance ." the effect was immediate . : 11.31597975908282
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on . : 14.074810302639415
at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , " mr . : 19.400227549748827
wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends -- whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them , is less certain ." " he has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship ," replied elizabeth with emphasis , " and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life ." darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject . : 10.248828566482619
at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving mr . : 12.344835321412956
darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner . : 10.937150374733337
" i have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir . : 21.196888069178122
such very superior dancing is not often seen . : 29.920831877810073
it is evident that you belong to the first circles . : 34.69546974281217
allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear miss eliza , ( glancing at her sister and bingley ,) shall take place . : 9.897306932795786
what congratulations will then flow in ! : 26.38064137809876
i appeal to mr . : 59.89023577715941
darcy :-- but let me not interrupt you , sir .-- you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me ." the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy ; but sir william ' s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane , who were dancing together . : 9.096865919940235
recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " sir william ' s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of ." " i do not think we were speaking at all . : 11.842572157848661
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves .-- we have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine ." " what think you of books ?" said he , smiling . : 10.040643887154557
" books -- oh ! : 63.151300332877646
no .-- i am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings ." " i am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject .-- we may compare our different opinions ." " no -- i cannot talk of books in a ball - room ; my head is always full of something else ." " the _present_ always occupies you in such scenes -- does it ?" said he , with a look of doubt . : 10.075203246683422
" yes , always ," she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , " i remember hearing you once say , mr . : 12.52675673396789
darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable . : 13.22362391061168
you are very cautious , i suppose , as to its _being created_ ." " i am ," said he , with a firm voice . : 13.7109361500191
" i do not get on at all . : 22.06013702522707
she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcy ' s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another . : 10.792325167824407
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , " so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham !-- your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old wickham , the late mr . : 11.575403356119189
darcy ' s steward . : 65.91639134037736
let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to mr . : 17.36295692337473
darcy ' s using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated mr . : 12.273027049678014
i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr . : 19.10309240828756
darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . : 14.477972120413801
his coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it . : 17.79463378530318
i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ' s guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better ." " his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same ," said elizabeth angrily ; " for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr . : 11.533259721334895
darcy ' s steward , and of _that_ , i can assure you , he informed me himself ." " i beg your pardon ," replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer . : 13.817303645859814
" excuse my interference .-- it was kindly meant ." " insolent girl !" said elizabeth to herself .--" you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . : 11.806771202930074
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr . : 15.104794019318172
darcy ." she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley . : 16.112426675915493
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .-- elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane ' s being in the fairest way for happiness . : 10.536878422517118
" i want to know ," said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ' s , " what you have learnt about mr . : 14.611598323653576
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon ." " no ," replied jane , " i have not forgotten him ; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you . : 12.401514680174845
bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr . : 15.519442320184737
wickham has deserved much less attention from mr . : 12.918289124937544
darcy than he has received ; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister ' s , mr . : 17.439505989082466
wickham is by no means a respectable young man . : 19.96438980315985
darcy ' s regard ." " mr . : 28.617575204665442
bingley does not know mr . : 50.52996677183138
wickham himself ?" " no ; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton ." " this account then is what he has received from mr . : 14.786652136209296
i am perfectly satisfied . : 68.96705745376028
but what does he say of the living ?" " he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from mr . : 14.46467989562428
darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only ." " i have not a doubt of mr . : 14.869269661524662
bingley ' s sincerity ," said elizabeth warmly ; " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . : 11.144290620793283
bingley ' s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before ." she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment . : 10.821550547498633
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley ' s regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it . : 12.178651515581047
on their being joined by mr . : 32.17631618470864
bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr . : 15.401987600540087
collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery . : 15.522268240362482
" i have found out ," said he , " by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness . : 14.634893157150795
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh , and of her mother lady catherine . : 12.353937355229574
how wonderfully these sort of things occur ! : 23.612414989762737
who would have thought of my meeting with -- perhaps -- a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly !-- i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . : 9.809143551737005
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology ." " you are not going to introduce yourself to mr . : 11.932336848101082
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . : 14.947777600712646
i believe him to be lady catherine ' s _nephew_ . : 37.78030327645906
darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to mr . : 9.998544484297872
collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , " my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom -- provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained . : 8.947465402684545
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself ." and with a low bow he left her to attack mr . : 7.3280915732692495
her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words " apology ," " hunsford ," and " lady catherine de bourgh ."-- it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man . : 10.144169426509484
darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last mr . : 16.559263418502127
collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility . : 15.419002005179735
collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and mr . : 17.67603646568394
darcy ' s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way . : 12.789571026613633
collins then returned to elizabeth . : 59.023697195149346
" i have no reason , i assure you ," said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception . : 16.590521087027888
darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . : 36.76137236981715
he answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of lady catherine ' s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily . : 13.052994970745031
it was really a very handsome thought . : 38.56764406946897
upon the whole , i am much pleased with him ." as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr . : 13.935068914155085
bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane . : 9.73104665322679
she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like bingley ' s two sisters . : 11.11696208717033
her mother ' s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much . : 11.08990043786579
when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( lady lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr . : 9.592790703462413
bingley .-- it was an animating subject , and mrs . : 26.04476650411012
his being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self - gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do . : 14.902828156057524
it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane ' s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked . : 12.149331143703996
it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than mrs . : 11.346974517211207
bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life . : 17.961020511341275
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it . : 11.1252144424153
darcy , who sat opposite to them . : 27.93034612978897
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical . : 23.311615887417485
" what is mr . : 80.58113985396493
darcy to me , pray , that i should be afraid of him ? : 32.3600868932078
i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear ." " for heaven ' s sake , madam , speak lower .-- what advantage can it be to you to offend mr . : 9.900445043249775
darcy ?-- you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing ." nothing that she could say , however , had any influence . : 16.669577834660533
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone . : 25.102001477748978
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation . : 13.480272773995631
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr . : 12.199899609694791
darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her . : 15.340925309847698
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity . : 12.657042217894494
at length however mrs . : 49.13181064713056
bennet had no more to say ; and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken . : 10.923502301251649
elizabeth now began to revive . : 53.132339984647736
by many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance ,-- but in vain ; mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song . : 8.707621100390053
mary ' s powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected .-- elizabeth was in agonies . : 11.978020020411096
she looked at jane , to see how she bore it ; but jane was very composedly talking to bingley . : 21.035435208858324
she looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave . : 11.866387925062797
she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night . : 11.741111771282148
he took the hint , and when mary had finished her second song , said aloud , " that will do extremely well , child . : 12.520681733684848
you have delighted us long enough . : 32.24402148292487
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit ." mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father ' s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good .-- others of the party were now applied to . : 13.052323530704088
" if i ," said mr . : 43.26684631820294
collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .-- i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . : 11.33104899895504
the rector of a parish has much to do .-- in the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron . : 13.377458862618036
he must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible . : 12.133853652279512
and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . : 9.421130799235979
i cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family ." and with a bow to mr . : 10.038053234078362
darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .-- many stared .-- many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than mr . : 10.17670460327764
darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable . : 12.376372699284483
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement . : 24.514192246258858
she was teazed by mr . : 32.89034310171325
collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others . : 14.79113477115962
he assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening . : 14.000461500385565
there was no arguing upon such a project . : 26.84555787382446
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas , who often joined them , and good - naturedly engaged mr . : 13.41167596270537
collins ' s conversation to herself . : 31.52868871865916
she was at least free from the offence of mr . : 23.413588159112265
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr . : 19.50514438817438
wickham , and rejoiced in it . : 48.61014386756123
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manoeuvre of mrs . : 17.85011501273902
bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family . : 11.250144946775666
hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves . : 10.816283420144936
they repulsed every attempt of mrs . : 22.74926927626399
bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr . : 12.903241007203638
collins , who was complimenting mr . : 27.323184543392717
bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests . : 13.862060761715664
bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene . : 26.688078011336884
bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other . : 18.318693692985804
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs . : 12.994193927956218
hurst or miss bingley ; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of " lord , how tired i am !" accompanied by a violent yawn . : 9.437930150856818
when at length they arose to take leave , mrs . : 16.15036615907205
bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to mr . : 11.890009459886727
bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation . : 16.00804841739543
bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time . : 12.687379449489477
bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield , in the course of three or four months . : 9.360390312653777
of having another daughter married to mr . : 24.198226401479303
collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure . : 16.855361357139905
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_ , the worth of each was eclipsed by mr . : 13.57061385369855
bingley and netherfield . : 119.84788995763549
chapter xix . : 107.29272991163054
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn . : 18.636124098979906
collins made his declaration in form . : 20.574413133445006
having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business . : 12.202268247694713
bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , " may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ?" before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , mrs . : 12.546222149266766
i am going away myself ." " no , no , nonsense , lizzy .-- i desire you will stay where you are ."-- and upon elizabeth ' s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , " lizzy , i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing mr . : 9.15497907684208
bennet and kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone mr . : 18.669039788048035
collins began . : 302.72597342421835
" believe me , my dear miss elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections . : 11.88136863619327
you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother ' s permission for this address . : 10.48736863428963
almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life . : 12.255010511392593
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying -- and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as i certainly did ." the idea of mr . : 10.05570972493619
collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : " my reasons for marrying are , first , that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish . : 7.702044685975953
secondly , that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly -- which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness . : 9.370600520620796
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too !) on this subject ; and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford -- between our pools at quadrille , while mrs . : 7.117185563727802
jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh ' s foot - stool , that she said , ' mr . : 10.306324415566543
collins , you must marry . : 54.04697802403123
a clergyman like you must marry .-- chuse properly , chuse a gentlewoman for _my_ sake ; and for your _own_ , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . : 8.751747752456502
this is my advice . : 74.80705715117911
find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to hunsford , and i will visit her .' allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . : 12.399498711413854
you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe ; and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite . : 10.318400406701636
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where i assure you there are many amiable young women . : 8.945425104249274
but the fact is , that being , as i am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , ( who , however , may live many years longer ,) i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place -- which , however , as i have already said , may not be for several years . : 10.827683432155645
this has been my motive , my fair cousin , and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . : 16.34481314364673
and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . : 17.57272771751203
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since i am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the <NUM> per cents . : 19.582743813957133
which will not be yours till after your mother ' s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to . : 17.07682619732236
on that head , therefore , i shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married ." it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now . : 8.668086490655837
" you forget that i have made no answer . : 28.13729053959489
let me do it without farther loss of time . : 17.427221382081203
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me . : 20.40587518088073
i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them ." " i am not now to learn ," replied mr . : 13.11139731730399
collins , with a formal wave of the hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time . : 9.185411499276684
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long ." " upon my word , sir ," cried elizabeth , " your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration . : 9.457204526139536
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time . : 10.332857576743727
i am perfectly serious in my refusal .-- you could not make _me_ happy , and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so .-- nay , were your friend lady catherine to know me , i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation ." " were it certain that lady catherine would think so ," said mr . : 11.342476699513286
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications ." " indeed , mr . : 14.67195809086634
collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary . : 31.097387778859037
in making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self - reproach . : 11.04947321590666
this matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled ." and rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not mr . : 15.249984585023917
collins thus addressed her , " when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character ." " really , mr . : 10.913610634367283
collins ," cried elizabeth with some warmth , " you puzzle me exceedingly . : 19.253201533508097
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one ." " you must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course . : 10.54316519087563
my reasons for believing it are briefly these :-- it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable . : 9.06853843288324
my situation in life , my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . : 10.716933982213012
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . : 9.748752744543687
i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere . : 18.72120655314594
i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible . : 14.215442284751184
my feelings in every respect forbid it . : 27.180365940307738
can i speak plainer ? : 54.26992578703175
do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart ." " you are uniformly charming !" cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; " and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable ." to such perseverance in wilful self - deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female . : 8.816451578039779
bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast - room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection . : 9.259278249261463
collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character . : 9.570081662971415
this information , however , startled mrs . : 29.252260875743605
bennet ;-- she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so . : 13.600381942979613
" but depend upon it , mr . : 25.94527755989966
collins ," she added , " that lizzy shall be brought to reason . : 15.688719401082231
i will speak to her about it myself directly . : 36.044870310997126
collins ; " but if she is really headstrong and foolish , i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . : 13.958074929429896
if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity ." " sir , you quite misunderstand me ," said mrs . : 9.229323865586082
bennet , alarmed . : 118.26345469043603
" lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these . : 18.331977768433116
in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived . : 18.690445858469847
i will go directly to mr . : 34.31723019493873
bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , i am sure ." she would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , " oh ! : 14.222231200595992
bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar . : 22.408809432037774
collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_ ." mr . : 13.799915655118232
" i have not the pleasure of understanding you ," said he , when she had finished her speech . : 14.169906757720971
" of what are you talking ?" " of mr . : 32.51037408668809
collins and lizzy . : 107.08607962350443
lizzy declares she will not have mr . : 29.51895052373902
collins , and mr . : 56.39559096781446
collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy ." " and what am i to do on the occasion ?-- it seems an hopeless business ." " speak to lizzy about it yourself . : 12.740963105352845
she shall hear my opinion ." mrs . : 26.178206263269743
bennet rang the bell , and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library . : 25.52179099541147
" come here , child ," cried her father as she appeared . : 24.560424942351172
" i have sent for you on an affair of importance . : 19.739744588031026
i understand that mr . : 74.24688111237585
collins has made you an offer of marriage . : 18.663794810127968
" very well -- and this offer of marriage you have refused ?" " i have , sir ." " very well . : 16.961868069303286
we now come to the point . : 56.99587345106112
your mother insists upon your accepting it . : 17.53816906845868
is not it so , mrs . : 44.76266508098231
bennet ?" " yes , or i will never see her again ." " an unhappy alternative is before you , elizabeth . : 17.656199508311143
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents .-- your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry mr . : 11.324703400280045
collins , and i will never see you again if you _do_ ." elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but mrs . : 13.05035951479553
" what do you mean , mr . : 26.698913314011612
you promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him ." " my dear ," replied her husband , " i have two small favours to request . : 12.671821518924745
first , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room . : 21.461141219617517
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be ." not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did mrs . : 15.402060995680799
bennet give up the point . : 58.43653656985705
she talked to elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns . : 11.923360174343234
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest , but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering ;-- and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks . : 9.845433428684132
though her manner varied however , her determination never did . : 21.483833362538054
collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed . : 14.064845254513015
his regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother ' s reproach prevented his feeling any regret . : 15.363374426582547
she was met in the vestibule by lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , " i am glad you are come , for there is such fun here !-- what do you think has happened this morning ?-- mr . : 11.022879966172928
collins has made an offer to lizzy , and she will not have him ." charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast - room , where mrs . : 14.589501083837375
bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on miss lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family . : 12.44819068924469
" pray do , my dear miss lucas ," she added in a melancholy tone , " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , i am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves ." charlotte ' s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth . : 9.779229394133187
bennet , " looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at york , provided she can have her own way .-- but i tell you what , miss lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all -- and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead .-- _i_ shall not be able to keep you -- and so i warn you .-- i have done with you from this very day .-- i told you in the library , you know , that i should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word . : 10.171171478448645
i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children .-- not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body . : 10.777796622350387
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking . : 10.765590990055623
nobody can tell what i suffer !-- but it is always so . : 20.18497761856689
those who do not complain are never pitied ." her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation . : 6.379335311928617
she talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr . : 18.655450992324152
collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , " now , i do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let mr . : 16.010187194792703
collins and me have a little conversation together ." elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and charlotte , detained first by the civility of mr . : 12.030639952538078
collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear . : 13.155884695981955
in a doleful voice mrs . : 33.76482782578473
bennet thus began the projected conversation .--" oh ! : 14.758140857072341
collins !"-- " my dear madam ," replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point . : 15.50936467893177
far be it from me ," he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter . : 10.298868130225216
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . : 7.498050629235768
you will not , i hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter ' s favour , without having paid yourself and mr . : 10.181679671417191
bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf . : 12.139239995130035
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter ' s lips instead of your own . : 10.253753697697718
but we are all liable to error . : 28.4209964136661
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair . : 23.177747462363193
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible , i here beg leave to apologise ." chapter xxi . : 11.672446040816826
the discussion of mr . : 74.7187716350563
collins ' s offer was now nearly at an end , and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother . : 11.409124014208723
as for the gentleman himself , _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence . : 9.939709975723126
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs . : 18.982956958582864
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it . : 14.346392336473318
after breakfast , the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr . : 15.737878099510407
wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball . : 20.11933626899374
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt ' s , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over .-- to elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed . : 10.389344646285725
" i found ," said he , " as the time drew near , that i had better not meet mr . : 16.470323800836617
darcy ;-- that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than i could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself ." she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her . : 12.984316648278789
his accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother . : 13.155207580721623
soon after their return , a letter was delivered to miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and was opened immediately . : 15.551236517770265
jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs . : 9.692911288531825
when they had gained their own room , jane taking out the letter , said , " this is from caroline bingley ; what it contains , has surprised me a good deal . : 11.831513604081419
the whole party have left netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again . : 14.570295334103989
you shall hear what she says ." she then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street , where mr . : 10.646898577759728
hurst had a house . : 77.92436898351916
the next was in these words . : 59.91412417168593
" i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence . : 9.927560513754415
i depend on you for that ." to these high flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr . : 10.025005939504947
bingley ' s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his . : 17.234370057737717
" it is unlucky ," said she , after a short pause , " that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country . : 12.672469216637701
but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ?-- mr . : 9.485494190092153
bingley will not be detained in london by them ." " caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter . : 11.96345070238833
i will read it to you -- " when my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to london , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel . : 10.772516413422217
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you ." " it is evident by this ," added jane , " that he comes back no more this winter ." " it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he _should_ ." " why will you think so ? : 10.119100156119234
it must be his own doing .-- he is his own master . : 29.449411948249598
but you do not know _all_ . : 46.70385355696246
i _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me . : 12.893192898046639
i will have no reserves from _you_ ." " mr . : 22.176979361501605
darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again . : 12.348057385262646
i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but i will not leave the country without confiding them , and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable . : 11.101256044113141
with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am i wrong , my dearest jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ?" " what think you of _this_ sentence , my dear lizzy ?"-- said jane as she finished it . : 9.630159266103316
" is it not clear enough ?-- does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ' s indifference , and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly !) to put me on my guard ? : 9.694762703538805
can there be any other opinion on the subject ?" " yes , there can ; for mine is totally different .-- will you hear it ?" " most willingly ." " you shall have it in few words . : 10.746032176582496
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry miss darcy . : 19.19960495257479
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you ." jane shook her head . : 15.059860734370698
" indeed , jane , you ought to believe me .-- no one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection . : 17.773585402011076
miss bingley i am sure cannot . : 38.28001327945509
she is not such a simpleton . : 77.04497120946954
but the case is this . : 82.35653745405797
we are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and i dare say it would succeed , if miss de bourgh were out of the way . : 11.237192136166547
but , my dearest jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend ." " if we thought alike of miss bingley ," replied jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quite easy . : 10.970992982074893
but i know the foundation is unjust . : 39.09003629270103
caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one ; and all that i can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself ." " that is right .-- you could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine . : 9.88917689100766
you have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer ." " but , my dear sister , can i be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ?" " you must decide for yourself ," said elizabeth , " and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , i advise you by all means to refuse him ." " how can you talk so ?"-- said jane faintly smiling ,--" you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , i could not hesitate ." " i did not think you would ;-- and that being the case , i cannot consider your situation with much compassion ." " but if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . : 9.55259519406105
a thousand things may arise in six months !" the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt . : 10.126372744827906
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect . : 14.162335962496785
jane ' s temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart . : 12.060707889552198
they agreed that mrs . : 56.974214588544186
after lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that mr . : 12.968873662637794
bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses . : 15.237041214543943
collins . : 1959.8670242488388
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her . : 25.206911549210346
" it keeps him in good humour ," said she , " and i am more obliged to you than i can express ." charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time . : 13.266084915324559
this was very amiable , but charlotte ' s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of ;-- its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of mr . : 11.041179012890128
collins ' s addresses , by engaging them towards herself . : 16.38925859606218
such was miss lucas ' s scheme ; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon . : 11.52053592522603
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday . : 9.889089684406963
his reception however was of the most flattering kind . : 32.580882929006236
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane . : 12.57631726393675
but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there . : 12.902128181129685
in as short a time as mr . : 28.402177499863726
collins ' s long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness . : 12.107262737146522
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained . : 8.559778763490147
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity . : 11.40164125850536
collins ' s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair . : 10.338153892132873
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer mr . : 10.58562990768289
bennet was likely to live ; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever mr . : 19.212552308863067
james ' s . : 52.587472533126565
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion . : 18.02134309903396
the younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte ' s dying an old maid . : 8.104642601625015
she had gained her point , and had time to consider of it . : 23.35703144579843
her reflections were in general satisfactory . : 52.46426776377089
collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary . : 14.056364090992876
but still he would be her husband .-- without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well - educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want . : 8.00612225090226
this preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty - seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it . : 13.4950169049283
the least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person . : 15.940336120682376
elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation . : 14.6877449596598
she resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged mr . : 25.968301106934277
collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . : 14.93953647918831
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self - denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love . : 8.609138993507713
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave - taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and mrs . : 12.089789604910816
bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them . : 12.314253345201955
" my dear madam ," he replied , " this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible ." they were all astonished ; and mr . : 12.12183444130775
bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , " but is there not danger of lady catherine ' s disapprobation here , my good sir ?-- you had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness ." " my dear sir ," replied mr . : 8.569674118456318
collins , " i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship ' s concurrence ." " you cannot be too much on your guard . : 10.438409134891325
risk any thing rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which i should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence ." " believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire . : 9.732035277409295
as for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin elizabeth ." with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return . : 7.830305707772456
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her ' s , he might become a very agreeable companion . : 10.044446902061726
but on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away . : 23.8746636439976
miss lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before . : 15.541192588746926
the possibility of mr . : 69.23452876423698
collins ' s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " engaged to mr . : 10.640333987790855
collins ! : 2398.2662848437462
collins should be able to procure any woman ' s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ?" but elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness . : 12.587568742464605
" i see what you are feeling ," replied charlotte ,--" you must be surprised , very much surprised ,-- so lately as mr . : 11.293020969768152
collins was wishing to marry you . : 33.81133216674764
but when you have had time to think it all over , i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done . : 24.4790617094602
i am not romantic you know . : 33.10332787814346
i never was . : 165.16383935065258
i ask only a comfortable home ; and considering mr . : 24.24927579577548
collins ' s character , connections , and situation in life , i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state ." elizabeth quietly answered " undoubtedly ;"-- and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family . : 9.807858314319217
charlotte did not stay much longer , and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard . : 19.30459084215515
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match . : 16.93114964818673
the strangeness of mr . : 65.20920855393373
chapter xxiii . : 154.66274059543377
with many compliments to them , and much self - gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter ,-- to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mrs . : 11.308513862991678
bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , " good lord ! : 10.773877146822658
sir william , how can you tell such a story ?-- do not you know that mr . : 16.016865519800984
collins wants to marry lizzy ?" nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but sir william ' s good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy . : 10.418614152674763
elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of mr . : 9.996198582589798
collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london . : 18.918161441415187
bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent . : 11.01904836434386
in the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that mr . : 14.763302572472405
collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and fourthly , that the match might be broken off . : 15.387825807797942
two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ; one , that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day . : 12.058152865962434
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter . : 11.628858373380963
bennet ' s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter ! : 13.917790825783795
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable . : 13.885848923335562
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for mr . : 13.72781786015365
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs . : 10.993790312911358
bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs . : 13.92597352099898
bennet ' s sour looks and ill - natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away . : 11.565153565576052
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again . : 9.21137435168412
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return . : 10.536549534029398
collins arrived on tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have prompted . : 13.824182683335808
after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men . : 9.289197566333987
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs . : 18.120959005564014
bingley ' s continued absence . : 38.388505627426326
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject . : 12.411817636478274
day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed mrs . : 9.711585646343751
bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . : 17.52504988439724
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment . : 15.113102937978587
as for jane , _her_ anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than elizabeth ' s ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to . : 14.427472246912174
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used . : 12.251152246774346
it needed all jane ' s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity . : 10.468723852235287
collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight , but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction . : 13.703027097332573
he was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love - making relieved them from a great deal of his company . : 15.779246945328659
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge , and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed . : 13.985958731051161
bennet was really in a most pitiable state . : 37.0938064135509
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of . : 12.054414242133266
as her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence . : 20.383138319199233
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr . : 10.78225707147043
collins , was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as mr . : 17.828892007884452
bennet were dead . : 98.16624400086708
" indeed , mr . : 63.60521099535919
bennet ," said she , " it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that i should be forced to make way for _her_ , and live to see her take my place in it !" " my dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . : 10.779621935269535
let us hope for better things . : 16.914720540896557
let us flatter ourselves that _i_ may be the survivor ." this was not very consoling to mrs . : 10.23164091894544
bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , " i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate . : 17.251972051420953
bennet , for any thing about the entail . : 46.68438160430686
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ' s own daughters i cannot understand ; and all for the sake of mr . : 12.370603946345689
collins too !-- why should _he_ have it more than anybody else ?" " i leave it to yourself to determine ," said mr . : 11.296879945857519
end of vol . : 50.9207620782905
ii . : 280.4560503827073
pride & prejudice . : 53.60217223847958
miss bingley ' s letter arrived , and put an end to doubt . : 18.576364591577846
the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter , and concluded with her brother ' s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country . : 12.151007180996801
hope was over , entirely over ; and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort . : 12.894319407133636
miss darcy ' s praise occupied the chief of it . : 16.7388066837583
her many attractions were again dwelt on , and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter . : 11.905261409790766
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother ' s being an inmate of mr . : 15.773238232001548
darcy ' s house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture . : 11.630722211383699
elizabeth , to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation . : 14.374245532203519
her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others . : 19.102764438464348
to caroline ' s assertion of her brother ' s being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit . : 15.505858128122858
had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister ' s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself . : 13.482481193895646
it was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing . : 20.935400508630128
she could think of nothing else , and yet whether bingley ' s regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ' interference ; whether he had been aware of jane ' s attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister ' s situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded . : 9.786157726785232
bennet ' s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " oh ! : 10.638798127071485
that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . : 12.761022724929223
but i will not repine . : 58.45156177538962
it cannot last long . : 67.03658149573391
he will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before ." elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing . : 15.436801094202867
" you doubt me ," cried jane , slightly colouring ; " indeed you have no reason . : 18.314257368940424
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all . : 22.235981833002636
i have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with . : 19.711431505217572
thank god ! : 128.92587935453935
i have not _that_ pain . : 41.440589381063496
a little time therefore .-- i shall certainly try to get the better ." with a stronger voice she soon added , " i have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself ." " my dear jane !" exclaimed elizabeth , " you are too good . : 11.296805172892759
your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; i do not know what to say to you . : 12.898734700831117
i feel as if i had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve ." miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister ' s warm affection . : 10.742972037407053
" nay ," said elizabeth , " this is not fair . : 25.809432390816426
_you_ wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if i speak ill of any body . : 21.864962699110794
_i_ only want to think _you_ perfect , and you set yourself against it . : 14.055191779532235
do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will . : 11.313955779793973
you need not . : 164.58388567060902
there are few people whom i really love , and still fewer of whom i think well . : 16.801078245255063
the more i see of the world , the more am i dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense . : 14.004190374655177
i have met with two instances lately ; one i will not mention ; the other is charlotte ' s marriage . : 14.071082037560569
it is unaccountable ! : 132.20756652905993
in every view it is unaccountable !" " my dear lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . : 15.783176858417477
they will ruin your happiness . : 32.55992287748576
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper . : 13.810265159691625
remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for every body ' s sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin ." " to oblige you , i would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him , i should only think worse of her understanding , than i now do of her heart . : 12.97811057208053
collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow - minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as i do ; and you must feel , as well as i do , that the woman who marries him , cannot have a proper way of thinking . : 11.764809535412835
you shall not defend her , though it is charlotte lucas . : 33.406611710036245
you shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness ." " i must think your language too strong in speaking of both ," replied jane , " and i hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together . : 9.208635081207733
but enough of this . : 141.6518107023676
you mentioned _two_ instances . : 61.19654603676285
i cannot misunderstand you , but i intreat you , dear lizzy , not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . : 12.644041951007049
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured . : 15.112789056219752
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect . : 15.533667377433336
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us . : 13.980984964887286
women fancy admiration means more than it does ." " and men take care that they should ." " if it is designedly done , they cannot be justified ; but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine ." " i am far from attributing any part of mr . : 10.576599722950682
bingley ' s conduct to design ," said elizabeth ; " but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery . : 13.133821762971273
thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people ' s feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business ." " and do you impute it to either of those ?" " yes ; to the last . : 13.688333281110173
but if i go on , i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem . : 15.973541464465708
stop me whilst you can ." " you persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him ." " yes , in conjunction with his friend ." " i cannot believe it . : 12.232382954865503
why should they try to influence him ? : 17.914915943692858
they have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better . : 10.99704755149091
but , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother ' s . : 16.681461455453483
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? : 14.757384792670564
if they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed . : 15.991509394387363
by supposing such an affection , you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy . : 16.346560825552494
do not distress me by the idea . : 41.86892377356799
i am not ashamed of having been mistaken -- or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . : 13.446720765083827
let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood ." elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time mr . : 16.51044585476351
bingley ' s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them . : 16.071574492241822
bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity . : 10.3842525418875
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day . : 12.96482710582167
bennet treated the matter differently . : 47.70095315481005
i congratulate her . : 152.31955873669168
next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then . : 18.396356437298994
it is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . : 20.280655896542033
you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane . : 24.121389329288057
now is your time . : 93.57964727543491
here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . : 12.815034680439263
let wickham be _your_ man . : 23.796975717664356
he is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably ." " thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . : 13.40080170659275
bennet , " but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it ." mr . : 12.136153680894257
wickham ' s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom , which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family . : 8.571383893735993
they saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve . : 18.3559379026705
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard , his claims on mr . : 20.73541690337955
darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr . : 13.823910394630092
darcy before they had known any thing of the matter . : 42.00871349400468
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of hertfordshire ; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes -- but by everybody else mr . : 7.695229774619754
darcy was condemned as the worst of men . : 24.082041817833467
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , mr . : 10.493204167627235
collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday . : 15.89484287078945
the pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men . : 13.030437995489898
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks . : 10.42478134295702
on the following monday , mrs . : 27.984992066578283
bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn . : 14.455707201894931
gardiner was a sensible , gentleman - like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education . : 12.905766137473515
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable . : 14.168879327887824
gardiner , who was several years younger than mrs . : 14.66008593424647
bennet and mrs . : 91.66241407165747
between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard . : 14.967229568493979
they had frequently been staying with her in town . : 25.98476993875797
gardiner ' s business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions . : 10.453368674733174
when this was done , she had a less active part to play . : 23.074311262523032
it became her turn to listen . : 38.28798304374416
bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of . : 19.708811742100696
they had all been very ill - used since she last saw her sister . : 14.341598426726353
two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it . : 23.65415661711989
" i do not blame jane ," she continued , " for jane would have got mr . : 17.31667912596159
bingley , if she could . : 89.19390023351019
but , lizzy ! : 161.37167687592503
oh , sister ! : 100.5017829699954
it is very hard to think that she might have been mr . : 21.92310087076713
he made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him . : 22.47493406256244
the lucases are very artful people indeed , sister . : 24.601955280244418
they are all for what they can get . : 37.2040981443682
however , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and i am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves ." mrs . : 11.412672999942568
when alone with elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject . : 21.845477327234985
" i am sorry it went off . : 21.447744263440345
but these things happen so often ! : 33.729431562009324
a young man , such as you describe mr . : 29.9427144774615
bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent ." " an excellent consolation in its way ," said elizabeth , " but it will not do for _us_ . : 10.995185833583827
we do not suffer by _accident_ . : 28.828810146259393
it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before ." " but that expression of ' violently in love ' is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea . : 9.559894249552482
it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half - hour ' s acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment . : 13.716422798255364
pray , how _violent was_ mr . : 17.48854157276991
bingley ' s love ?" " i never saw a more promising inclination . : 16.40333605751372
he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . : 14.991897555020348
every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable . : 18.471549181824862
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and i spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer . : 13.110748218750052
could there be finer symptoms ? : 32.500726917336635
poor jane ! : 171.8218542582144
but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? : 22.97023294977827
change of scene might be of service -- and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything ." elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ' s ready acquiescence . : 11.054351624694014
gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her . : 14.024057092771212
we live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her ." " and _that_ is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and mr . : 12.158999041984218
darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london ! : 23.004508434115984
my dear aunt , how could you think of it ? : 33.08401396281964
darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as gracechurch street , but he would hardly think a month ' s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , mr . : 9.279761694121138
bingley never stirs without him ." " so much the better . : 18.10623907332642
i hope they will not meet at all . : 37.21490263097011
but does not jane correspond with the sister ? : 38.69527269585409
_she_ will not be able to help calling ." " she will drop the acquaintance entirely ." but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley ' s being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless . : 10.473048010689595
it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re - animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane ' s attractions . : 14.839459036979633
miss bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure ; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by caroline ' s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him . : 13.712834985138684
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn ; and what with the philipses , the lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement . : 17.642341125161742
when the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers mr . : 14.722904037193272
wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , mrs . : 20.259191096999213
gardiner , rendered suspicious by elizabeth ' s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both . : 10.518222582010196
to mrs . : 289.57322193200804
gardiner , wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers . : 12.186730190733943
about ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire , to which he belonged . : 13.272892131438828
they had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy ' s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring . : 13.378825069067386
gardiner had seen pemberley , and known the late mr . : 22.615951833447042
darcy by character perfectly well . : 34.566260474195225
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse . : 17.344769572886616
in comparing her recollection of pemberley , with the minute description which wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself . : 9.950712308389583
darcy ' s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman ' s reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard mr . : 11.05360952045496
fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill - natured boy . : 12.345936391345646
gardiner ' s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : " you are too sensible a girl , lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , i am not afraid of speaking openly . : 10.115792586721069
seriously , i would have you be on your guard . : 29.508167770066823
i have nothing to say against _him_ ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , i should think you could not do better . : 15.888997559946962
but as it is -- you must not let your fancy run away with you . : 20.690464190894527
you have sense , and we all expect you to use it . : 23.615418114482626
your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct , i am sure . : 14.338814741174513
he shall not be in love with me , if i can prevent it ." " elizabeth , you are not serious now ." " i beg your pardon . : 18.243009056636758
i will try again . : 68.35257031515007
at present i am not in love with mr . : 29.239023085107736
wickham ; no , i certainly am not . : 49.71620607000225
but he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man i ever saw -- and if he becomes really attached to me -- i believe it will be better that he should not . : 14.498186226739268
i see the imprudence of it .-- oh ! : 33.30032215586347
_that_ abominable mr . : 53.98681864113473
darcy !-- my father ' s opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and i should be miserable to forfeit it . : 13.063001678189277
my father , however , is partial to mr . : 29.95264651490633
in short , my dear aunt , i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted , or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ? : 9.858881363281336
all that i can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry . : 29.240641286581052
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object . : 19.550033629979147
when i am in company with him , i will not be wishing . : 26.371915655769943
in short , i will do my best ." " perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often . : 18.134802358032275
at least , you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him ." " as i did the other day ," said elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; " very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_ . : 12.64630545126476
but do not imagine that he is always here so often . : 30.53556475503303
it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . : 18.25524553213346
you know my mother ' s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends . : 19.960949668345773
but really , and upon my honour , i will try to do what i think to be wisest ; and now , i hope you are satisfied ." her aunt assured her that she was ; and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented . : 13.635412512448585
collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane ; but as he took up his abode with the lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs . : 13.732353358559388
his marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill - natured tone that she " _wished_ they might be happy ." thursday was to be the wedding day , and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , elizabeth , ashamed of her mother ' s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room . : 10.862170285581488
as they went down stairs together , charlotte said , " i shall depend on hearing from you very often , eliza ." " _that_ you certainly shall ." " and i have another favour to ask . : 12.195564460164789
will you come and see me ?" " we shall often meet , i hope , in hertfordshire ." " i am not likely to leave kent for some time . : 15.741656004749126
promise me , therefore , to come to hunsford ." elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit . : 15.729756416620898
" my father and maria are to come to me in march ," added charlotte , " and i hope you will consent to be of the party . : 17.100716385296387
indeed , eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them ." the wedding took place ; the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual . : 12.004399709750249
elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible . : 13.401328598127765
elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was . : 12.735114571817759
charlotte ' s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like lady catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen . : 11.345428074772379
she wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise . : 13.755338811777323
the house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and lady catherine ' s behaviour was most friendly and obliging . : 17.50965659359032
it was mr . : 133.86836540398906
collins ' s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened ; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest . : 15.508079497910407
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is . : 14.202396897376623
jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from caroline . : 15.905548025891198
she accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn , had by some accident been lost . : 19.220893904178475
" i did not think caroline in spirits ," were her words , " but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london . : 13.22917662790777
darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him . : 36.837028896325954
i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner . : 36.89060030057324
i wish i could see her . : 60.65499246091037
my visit was not long , as caroline and mrs . : 33.12653648549127
i dare say i shall soon see them here ." elizabeth shook her head over this letter . : 13.431454198932034
it convinced her , that accident only could discover to mr . : 19.170630589043622
bingley her sister ' s being in town . : 30.69018594149613
four weeks passed away , and jane saw nothing of him . : 23.60418566527969
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley ' s inattention . : 13.895375362882438
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow jane to deceive herself no longer . : 13.12394358249118
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt . : 24.52509852116599
" my dearest lizzy will , i am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expence , when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley ' s regard for me . : 11.32420831055469
but , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if i still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . : 10.78651411210591
i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , i am sure i should be deceived again . : 14.434624227169984
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did i receive in the mean time . : 13.242878888274186
when she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . : 12.628597664863396
i pity , though i cannot help blaming her . : 31.43265891174317
but i pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . : 19.111029990149085
i need not explain myself farther ; and though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable . : 12.14163448808896
i cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago . : 14.753566048069883
he knows of my being in town , i am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy . : 13.491556535532586
i cannot understand it . : 66.7929316921992
but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . : 13.983258874459498
let me hear from you very soon . : 18.846783357821522
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . : 17.544174303536447
we had better not mention it . : 35.69789932875943
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford . : 12.6939522806117
i am sure you will be very comfortable there . : 26.520977851016372
" your ' s , & c ." this letter gave elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least . : 11.164271318362879
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over . : 27.9695718283303
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions . : 28.195423539204675
darcy ' s sister , as , by wickham ' s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away . : 19.610834794463507
gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself . : 10.82664436699864
his apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else . : 13.621356239997617
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain . : 17.01943729433434
her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it . : 11.993678035909175
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ; but elizabeth , less clear - sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte ' s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence . : 11.797359893048046
all this was acknowledged to mrs . : 35.29881126103836
gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on :--" i am now convinced , my dear aunt , that i have never been much in love ; for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion , i should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil . : 9.96987811091453
but my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_ ; they are even impartial towards miss king . : 12.209853581341598
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly . : 11.139095607045139
they are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain ." chapter iv . : 12.695332756046453
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family , and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did january and february pass away . : 8.178549770272149
march was to take elizabeth to hunsford . : 29.244040393719796
she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty . : 12.35177695697056
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of mr . : 9.983630139499015
there was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters , home could not be faultless , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake . : 13.776122387092157
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay . : 14.38406853550607
every thing , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to charlotte ' s first sketch . : 14.016674376425636
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter . : 27.99777425857682
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be . : 13.16896439534585
the only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter . : 17.2870965621563
the farewell between herself and mr . : 35.095048644921405
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her -- their opinion of every body -- would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . : 10.081463431445828
her fellow - travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable . : 16.787942586019852
sir william lucas , and his daughter maria , a good humoured girl , but as empty - headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise . : 11.585406831886967
elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known sir william ' s too long . : 21.61545750678426
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out like his information . : 11.822609303811447
it was a journey of only twenty - four miles , and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch - street by noon . : 10.940909692409972
as they drove to mr . : 36.13066117196494
gardiner ' s door , jane was at a drawing - room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever . : 10.682110502968987
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin ' s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing - room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower . : 9.617264180068526
all was joy and kindness . : 38.99412913068783
the day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres . : 14.33749648367145
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt . : 31.98661971957066
their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection . : 10.927829673502863
it was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long . : 24.586325232396874
gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley ' s visit in gracechurch - street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance . : 11.509064922960274
gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham ' s desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well . : 11.682774071431552
" but , my dear elizabeth ," she added , " what sort of girl is miss king ? : 15.527399444070676
i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary ." " pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? : 11.619056024336153
where does discretion end , and avarice begin ? : 23.18219019841849
last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary ." " if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is , i shall know what to think ." " she is a very good kind of girl , i believe . : 12.657380562257604
i know no harm of her ." " but he paid her not the smallest attention , till her grandfather ' s death made her mistress of this fortune ." " no -- why should he ? : 12.430083637084282
if it was not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections , because i had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ?" " but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event ." " a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe . : 9.860925179926081
it only shews her being deficient in something herself -- sense or feeling ." " well ," cried elizabeth , " have it as you choose . : 11.014917793634378
_he_ shall be mercenary , and _she_ shall be foolish ." " no , lizzy , that is what i do _not_ choose . : 16.95209585220106
i should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire ." " oh ! : 14.13678370512279
if that is all , i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better . : 15.460067681720682
i am sick of them all . : 50.7193579097291
i am going to - morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him . : 11.095542992500349
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all ." " take care , lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment ." before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer . : 9.530839147785626
" we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us ," said mrs . : 12.451006928359927
what felicity ! : 416.5006917068129
you give me fresh life and vigour . : 22.025331571673213
adieu to disappointment and spleen . : 14.244280460068705
what are men to rocks and mountains ? : 14.871934098720876
what hours of transport we shall spend ! : 28.02719651487647
we _will_ know where we have gone -- we _will_ recollect what we have seen . : 13.592131764803153
let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers ." chapter v . : 7.673840341407912
every object in the next day ' s journey was new and interesting to elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight . : 12.557716180026304
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford , every eye was in search of the parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view . : 13.28898942225471
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side . : 15.637178585983317
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants . : 25.964501510263368
at length the parsonage was discernible . : 28.250324314746862
the garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , every thing declared they were arriving . : 15.65237920896423
in a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other . : 17.973519024381584
collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received . : 14.954264981131706
she saw instantly that her cousin ' s manners were not altered by his marriage ; his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family . : 10.731740849360017
they were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife ' s offers of refreshment . : 11.00761159632654
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him . : 11.57621142468292
but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion . : 10.626087909073169
collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte . : 12.272385518076739
once or twice she could discern a faint blush ; but in general charlotte wisely did not hear . : 12.057379949779733
after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london , mr . : 12.325602807284907
collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself . : 13.685099902083804
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible . : 12.885266673345058
here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind . : 6.393496845791597
he could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump . : 13.800400849692268
but of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house . : 11.039045734613548
it was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground . : 11.174432477603904
from his garden , mr . : 40.174032425719346
collins would have led them round his two meadows , but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back ; and while sir william accompanied him , charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband ' s help . : 9.311680529997243
collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by charlotte ' s evident enjoyment of it , elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten . : 14.143096608633785
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country . : 23.22751261422134
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when mr . : 17.641636387626992
collins joining in , observed , " yes , miss elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church , and i need not say you will be delighted with her . : 13.33488760636868
she is all affability and condescension , and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . : 14.097123833462915
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . : 10.051789816361817
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming . : 41.3005035419761
her ladyship ' s carriage is regularly ordered for us . : 15.527676029652557
i _should_ say , one of her ladyship ' s carriages , for she has several ." " lady catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed ," added charlotte , " and a most attentive neighbour ." " very true , my dear , that is exactly what i say . : 14.580270841936594
she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference ." the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte ' s degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well . : 9.954666092809118
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of mr . : 8.378391644784525
collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings . : 21.921944211288537
a lively imagination soon settled it all . : 26.81262394468625
about the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her . : 11.661097486884158
pray make haste and come into the dining - room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! : 15.41166745658472
make haste , and come down this moment ." elizabeth asked questions in vain ; maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining - room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate . : 10.152730184891709
" and is this all ?" cried elizabeth . : 31.03810373752617
" i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter !" " la ! : 16.205994294666674
jenkinson , who lives with them . : 28.865983637623337
the other is miss de bourgh . : 44.39461651755395
only look at her . : 89.05335290642772
she is quite a little creature . : 64.06933614678137
who would have thought she could be so thin and small !" " she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind . : 12.110508084738866
why does she not come in ?" " oh ! : 18.322388916710473
charlotte says , she hardly ever does . : 36.46490137738322
it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in ." " i like her appearance ," said elizabeth , struck with other ideas . : 10.350359670892484
" she looks sickly and cross .-- yes , she will do for him very well . : 18.03301919522417
she will make him a very proper wife ." mr . : 27.267877150200437
collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and sir william , to elizabeth ' s high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way . : 11.814189857777023
at length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house . : 19.285808568447752
collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day . : 9.107559832029095
" i confess ," said he , " that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship ' s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings . : 12.255210405060195
i rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen . : 27.476321473399953
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? : 29.294202287022404
collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them . : 12.372709485623782
when the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to elizabeth , " do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel . : 11.542686934218324
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter . : 10.127091842235373
i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more . : 12.887381106537191
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed . : 16.48961550483719
she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved ." while they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner .-- such formidable accounts of her ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened maria lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at st . : 10.103059482601411
as the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park .-- every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as mr . : 10.1331978455375
when they ascended the steps to the hall , maria ' s alarm was every moment increasing , and even sir william did not look perfectly calm .-- elizabeth ' s courage did not fail her . : 11.135740554690525
from the entrance hall , of which mr . : 30.28832537584851
collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti - chamber , to the room where lady catherine , her daughter , and mrs . : 10.31200160409773
jenkinson were sitting .-- her ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as mrs . : 11.480767801791297
collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her ' s , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary . : 14.701748516757146
in spite of having been at st . : 32.989097282414356
james ' s , sir william was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look . : 10.509358229594403
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly .-- lady catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly - marked features , which might once have been handsome . : 11.25969391941357
her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank . : 14.960859154412592
wickham immediately to elizabeth ' s mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented . : 19.779948434503037
when , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr . : 11.908151828898497
darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in maria ' s astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small . : 17.009583725351973
there was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies . : 13.89635328760656
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to mrs . : 10.948044378935855
jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes . : 11.755381295408322
after sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , mr . : 13.650314249216938
collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyship ' s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater .-- he carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by sir william , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said , in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear . : 9.927330409173221
the party did not supply much conversation . : 40.29801098150197
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh -- the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time . : 11.173171238258815
jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed . : 8.601557962723813
maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire . : 14.388502339405253
when the ladies returned to the drawing - room , there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted . : 10.42700281198505
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady ' s attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others . : 12.100010310539858
in the intervals of her discourse with mrs . : 25.729780115380045
collins , she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to mrs . : 13.278423303857656
collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl . : 20.84116729794185
she asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother ' s maiden name ?-- elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly .-- lady catherine then observed , " your father ' s estate is entailed on mr . : 10.98267051378769
collins , i think . : 124.45250645188978
for your sake ," turning to charlotte , " i am glad of it ; but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line .-- it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh ' s family .-- do you play and sing , miss bennet ?" " a little ." " oh ! : 8.754982609534869
then -- some time or other we shall be happy to hear you . : 21.768966134944236
the miss webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as your ' s .-- do you draw ?" " no , not at all ." " what , none of you ?" " not one ." " that is very strange . : 14.077211122810375
but i suppose you had no opportunity . : 51.06051367683692
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters ." " my mother would have had no objection , but my father hates london ." " has your governess left you ?" " we never had any governess ." " no governess ! : 12.397535892589495
how was that possible ? : 65.0865018567624
five daughters brought up at home without a governess !-- i never heard of such a thing . : 12.978509976591658
your mother must have been quite a slave to your education ." elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case . : 14.558366977480516
who attended to you ? : 135.07583197900172
without a governess you must have been neglected ." " compared with some families , i believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means . : 12.332293579121808
we were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary . : 17.6402444708955
those who chose to be idle , certainly might ." " aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if i had known your mother , i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one . : 11.365526579695581
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way . : 14.011392536697501
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out . : 17.235361463506536
four nieces of mrs . : 32.38107087291572
jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that i recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . : 10.789719683061032
collins , did i tell you of lady metcalfe ' s calling yesterday to thank me ? : 13.874001142852283
she finds miss pope a treasure . : 23.193494110961545
' lady catherine ,' said she , ' you have given me a treasure .' are any of your younger sisters out , miss bennet ?" " yes , ma ' am , all ." " all !-- what , all five out at once ? : 11.26993621769257
perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company . : 21.08614633265568
but really , ma ' am , i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early .-- the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first . : 10.364974416364777
and to be kept back on _such_ a motive !-- i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind ." " upon my word ," said her ladyship , " you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person .-- pray , what is your age ?" " with three younger sisters grown up ," replied elizabeth smiling , " your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it ." lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence . : 8.713949373366018
" you cannot be more than twenty , i am sure ,-- therefore you need not conceal your age ." " i am not one and twenty ." when the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed . : 10.44974667624603
lady catherine , sir william , and mr . : 23.43193598447554
collins sat down to quadrille ; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs . : 11.05565100435027
jenkinson to make up her party . : 26.50928327929236
their table was superlatively stupid . : 28.071966830310433
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when mrs . : 11.539029185004381
jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh ' s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light . : 9.180601802967448
a great deal more passed at the other table . : 27.543538323278803
lady catherine was generally speaking -- stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself . : 9.766346836652716
sir william did not say much . : 34.17326118111322
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names . : 10.277122155583045
collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered . : 25.610200918159148
the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow . : 14.859144951133302
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr . : 14.416954232250744
collins ' s side , and as many bows on sir william ' s , they departed . : 16.71760970135819
as soon as they had driven from the door , elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings , which , for charlotte ' s sake , she made more favourable than it really was . : 15.272492426106188
but her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy mr . : 12.342247732628781
collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship ' s praise into his own hands . : 18.04658165780088
sir william staid only a week at hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter ' s being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with . : 12.132866846722619
collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road . : 11.616693546009875
the room in which the ladies sat was backwards . : 30.703243812837666
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining - parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for mr . : 10.506336148844518
collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement . : 14.398955375938762
from the drawing - room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to mr . : 16.32513455935247
collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day . : 11.084533513045002
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage , and had a few minutes ' conversation with charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out . : 14.146131196699724
collins did not walk to rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours . : 13.338205096605552
now and then , they were honoured with a call from her ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits . : 13.257187823261473
she examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs . : 9.757722859327345
collins ' s joints of meat were too large for her family . : 12.071875138558715
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr . : 13.15203428601078
collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty . : 7.8454664498941815
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of sir william , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first . : 11.498721440380908
their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the collinses ' reach . : 13.920512963195923
this however was no evil to elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors . : 11.916789592848705
her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine ' s curiosity . : 10.250273606906564
in this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away . : 22.500008479140313
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that mr . : 26.201977123776494
darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley ' s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself . : 10.887280990597832
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage , for mr . : 21.511703203615394
collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great intelligence . : 10.260528406652343
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects . : 11.284966524417639
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them , for mr . : 13.862732918834444
collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him . : 29.88729626385198
charlotte had seen them from her husband ' s room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , " i may thank you , eliza , for this piece of civility . : 12.50905480222798
darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me ." elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door - bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room . : 10.055801078682059
colonel fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman . : 12.435149655160746
darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to mrs . : 13.333927328348166
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word . : 21.66730885673536
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well - bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs . : 9.602879939302538
collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body . : 15.538788529087013
at length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family . : 14.865969072588305
she answered him in the usual way , and after a moment ' s pause , added , " my eldest sister has been in town these three months . : 18.387049739593508
colonel fitzwilliam ' s manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings . : 14.38411093131591
it was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till easter - day , almost a week after the gentlemen ' s arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening . : 11.758551767859982
for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter . : 19.3852173936028
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but mr . : 15.311662354866112
darcy they had only seen at church . : 38.37644906058153
the invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine ' s drawing - room . : 13.262834509969071
her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to darcy , much more than to any other person in the room . : 11.640835563632415
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings ; and mrs . : 14.778772300197137
he now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself , as well as of mr . : 9.56427533585847
_his_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , " what is that you are saying , fitzwilliam ? : 12.659546741852179
what is it you are talking of ? : 38.53058746710377
let me hear what it is ." " we are speaking of music , madam ," said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply . : 13.81321059925698
" of music ! : 224.58780702946433
then pray speak aloud . : 42.47888083506749
i must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music . : 26.15029041832038
there are few people in england , i suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste . : 12.034615314610829
and so would anne , if her health had allowed her to apply . : 18.024205255239142
i am confident that she would have performed delightfully . : 25.30010033876067
darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister ' s proficiency . : 22.099931135497858
" i am very glad to hear such a good account of her ," said lady catherine ; " and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal ." " i assure you , madam ," he replied , " that she does not need such advice . : 12.480536393331567
she practises very constantly ." " so much the better . : 22.471899291605233
it cannot be done too much ; and when i next write to her , i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account . : 17.143718381319648
i often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice . : 14.663224756954003
collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as i have often told her , to come to rosings every day , and play on the piano - forte in mrs . : 15.787191890405024
jenkinson ' s room . : 67.94992350935145
she would be in nobody ' s way , you know , in that part of the house ." mr . : 23.86005802629659
darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt ' s ill breeding , and made no answer . : 19.266310067005893
when coffee was over , colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument . : 15.480316165007537
lady catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano - forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ' s countenance . : 10.631904390083857
elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said , " you mean to frighten me , mr . : 16.65506232477292
but i will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well . : 15.398434763028577
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others . : 13.0865739422186
my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me ." " i shall not say that you are mistaken ," he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own ." elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to colonel fitzwilliam , " your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word i say . : 10.439103219405704
i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . : 11.921657724426854
indeed , mr . : 51.50719805553613
darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire -- and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too -- for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear ." " i am not afraid of you ," said he , smilingly . : 11.07701948378717
" pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of ," cried colonel fitzwilliam . : 16.582060570782062
" i should like to know how he behaves among strangers ." " you shall hear then -- but prepare yourself for something very dreadful . : 10.520679766310375
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball -- and at this ball , what do you think he did ? : 20.28139604962863
he danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . : 12.381148599207693
well , colonel fitzwilliam , what do i play next ? : 18.961306500548343
my fingers wait your orders ." " perhaps ," said darcy , " i should have judged better , had i sought an introduction , but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers ." " shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ?" said elizabeth , still addressing colonel fitzwilliam . : 9.707407494792164
" shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ?" " i can answer your question ," said fitzwilliam , " without applying to him . : 10.610619810361598
it is because he will not give himself the trouble ." " i certainly have not the talent which some people possess ," said darcy , " of conversing easily with those i have never seen before . : 12.04945031078275
i cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as i often see done ." " my fingers ," said elizabeth , " do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women ' s do . : 11.862545099684887
they have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . : 21.39119683529194
but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault -- because i would not take the trouble of practising . : 16.151615447041255
it is not that i do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman ' s of superior execution ." darcy smiled and said , " you are perfectly right . : 10.618285858203325
you have employed your time much better . : 26.911734716356932
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting . : 21.33534493688026
we neither of us perform to strangers ." here they were interrupted by lady catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of . : 13.046903350473304
elizabeth immediately began playing again . : 35.9861729190567
she has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to anne ' s . : 15.080574447579346
anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn ." elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ' s praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_ , had she been his relation . : 10.146685034603081
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth ' s performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste . : 7.7706897263529475
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship ' s carriage was ready to take them all home . : 14.597596471789712
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to jane , while mrs . : 18.73260901059772
collins and maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor . : 13.526730633685364
darcy only , entered the room . : 31.446940057034983
they then sat down , and when her enquiries after rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence . : 10.491380932039624
it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , " how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr . : 10.81040857453475
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr . : 24.601954631536305
he and his sisters were well , i hope , when you left london ." " perfectly so -- i thank you ." she found that she was to receive no other answer -- and , after a short pause , added , " i think i have understood that mr . : 13.704488691480918
bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again ?" " i have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future . : 12.500488708157143
but perhaps mr . : 121.72325933862534
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him . : 14.808498432702574
he took the hint , and soon began with , " this seems a very comfortable house . : 18.90924347062492
lady catherine , i believe , did a great deal to it when mr . : 15.323747994800742
collins first came to hunsford ." " i believe she did -- and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object ." " mr . : 12.307497957672254
collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife ." " yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . : 12.662524370274012
collins as the wisest thing she ever did . : 21.60131810779431
she seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her ." " it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends ." " an easy distance do you call it ? : 13.229610515608442
it is nearly fifty miles ." " and what is fifty miles of good road ? : 15.756071069186874
little more than half a day ' s journey . : 30.40697345741942
yes , i call it a _very_ easy distance ." " i should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match ," cried elizabeth . : 12.54843464144998
" i should never have said mrs . : 30.17567418896388
collins was settled _near_ her family ." " it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire . : 15.716405022774545
any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far ." as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . : 12.27095896100529
the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances . : 22.067655440331784
where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil . : 9.5720341066769
but that is not the case _here_ . : 49.99550194586846
collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys -- and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance ." mr . : 8.599314509129986
_you_ cannot have been always at longbourn ." elizabeth looked surprised . : 24.906718089272598
the gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , " are you pleased with kent ?" a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise -- and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk . : 9.60093677110758
the tãªte - ã - tãªte surprised them . : 16.368183183026723
darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away . : 11.480973692711103
" my dear eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way ." but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte ' s wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year . : 12.09976180636258
all field sports were over . : 36.34069646575566
within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day . : 13.04813472368076
they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt . : 13.84901333575562
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam ' s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind . : 12.181080896572134
but why mr . : 121.76098292049979
darcy came so often to the parsonage , it was more difficult to understand . : 25.572681271364285
it could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice -- a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself . : 10.41343497178454
he seldom appeared really animated . : 36.1873979894199
collins knew not what to make of him . : 30.179931619981016
colonel fitzwilliam ' s occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out .-- she watched him whenever they were at rosings , and whenever he came to hunsford ; but without much success . : 11.865972329348049
it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind . : 10.859881199378213
in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam . : 17.402983224881215
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , mr . : 11.576532930467456
darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all . : 19.869614325585257
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet mr . : 11.115625542922038
it seemed like wilful ill - nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her . : 9.67272716709035
collins ' s happiness ; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying _there_ too . : 11.474528959648536
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts ? : 30.989206790866454
she supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter . : 16.950976320792172
it distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage . : 17.455324974737252
she was engaged one day as she walked , in re - perusing jane ' s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr . : 11.087262623313128
darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her . : 11.937274846297449
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , " i did not know before that you ever walked this way ." " i have been making the tour of the park ," he replied , " as i generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage . : 10.051913585711706
are you going much farther ?" " no , i should have turned in a moment ." and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together . : 13.025560975476491
" do you certainly leave kent on saturday ?" said she . : 18.76030274253799
" yes -- if darcy does not put it off again . : 17.686733139570034
but i am at his disposal . : 42.27241209800913
he arranges the business just as he pleases ." " and if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice . : 16.49143573727576
i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr . : 11.17471023557941
darcy ." " he likes to have his own way very well ," replied colonel fitzwilliam . : 24.2425537314504
" but so we all do . : 39.59517806400842
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . : 14.466430071016454
a younger son , you know , must be inured to self - denial and dependence ." " in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either . : 13.090212260180623
now , seriously , what have you ever known of self - denial and dependence ? : 12.159644622858934
when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ?" " these are home questions -- and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature . : 9.867783468962863
but in matters of greater weight , i may suffer from the want of money . : 15.429117326980593
younger sons cannot marry where they like ." " unless where they like women of fortune , which i think they very often do ." " our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money ." " is this ," thought elizabeth , " meant for me ?" and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , " and pray , what is the usual price of an earl ' s younger son ? : 9.845905536800903
unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds ." he answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped . : 12.842371781814897
to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , " i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal . : 9.873780495558156
i wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind . : 17.139738149819827
but , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her ." " no ," said colonel fitzwilliam , " that is an advantage which he must divide with me . : 14.61956132448879
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy ." " are you , indeed ? : 26.011161171138223
and pray what sort of guardians do you make ? : 27.46372013423152
does your charge give you much trouble ? : 23.72248711985692
young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way ." as she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth . : 10.555490740441005
she directly replied , " you need not be frightened . : 32.25938846402995
i never heard any harm of her ; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world . : 15.059238742043316
she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , mrs . : 20.236673555686608
hurst and miss bingley . : 38.29566032278357
i think i have heard you say that you know them ." " i know them a little . : 25.326667697820454
their brother is a pleasant gentleman - like man -- he is a great friend of darcy ' s ." " oh ! : 12.89081936204083
yes ," said elizabeth drily --" mr . : 19.166817219703248
bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him ." " care of him !-- yes , i really believe darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care . : 10.034825655058897
from something that he told me in our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him . : 15.91542065045733
but i ought to beg his pardon , for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant . : 17.41209385090205
it was all conjecture ." " what is it you mean ?" " it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady ' s family , it would be an unpleasant thing ." " you may depend upon my not mentioning it ." " and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley . : 11.859379229684459
what he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer ." " did mr . : 10.497037217014475
darcy give you his reasons for this interference ?" " i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady ." " and what arts did he use to separate them ?" " he did not talk to me of his own arts ," said fitzwilliam smiling . : 11.224200925408148
" he only told me , what i have now told you ." elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation . : 16.290976711209282
after watching her a little , fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful . : 17.389820646125145
" i am thinking of what you have been telling me ," said she . : 20.517291615518822
" your cousin ' s conduct does not suit my feelings . : 24.13903412285625
darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ' s inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy ." " but ," she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . : 13.003236774357209
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case ." " that is not an unnatural surmise ," said fitzwilliam , " but it is lessening the honour of my cousin ' s triumph very sadly ." this was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr . : 11.473639151286072
darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage . : 10.354268753540783
there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard . : 14.385790225723055
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected . : 16.585813437731133
there could not exist in the world _two_ men , over whom mr . : 15.340786699201432
darcy could have such boundless influence . : 37.606840332489256
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr . : 18.427180231997635
bingley and jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them . : 13.384081934908814
if his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , _he_ was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer . : 15.557691569642891
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted . : 11.3986923492632
" there were some very strong objections against the lady ," were colonel fitzwilliam ' s words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in london . : 11.657099746644544
all loveliness and goodness as she is ! : 40.01056242042764
her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating . : 25.282149839020185
neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which mr . : 10.363722515244895
darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach ." when she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with mr . : 11.774327713542718
darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ' s connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining mr . : 11.892383184041002
bingley for his sister . : 85.77306708574757
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr . : 13.157447301048691
darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea . : 13.697916875917922
collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but mr . : 14.964084699845396
collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine ' s being rather displeased by her staying at home . : 12.674278745736308
when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr . : 13.721225336107258
darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent . : 13.511325722940803
they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering . : 7.303472639548284
but in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded . : 12.288780133284721
elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal . : 14.771025645646988
she could not think of darcy ' s leaving kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him . : 15.655326604686996
while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her . : 12.667880754120942
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better . : 11.71158584848687
he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room . : 16.53332999037605
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , " in vain have i struggled . : 14.467239765827191
it will not do . : 111.65956577221449
my feelings will not be repressed . : 48.37802769180174
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you ." elizabeth ' s astonishment was beyond expression . : 11.306626287482276
she stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent . : 21.2131847251069
his sense of her inferiority -- of its being a degradation -- of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit . : 10.772737525362967
in spite of her deeply - rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man ' s affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger . : 10.684575408342539
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand . : 11.533759432524315
as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer . : 21.816756046113948
he _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security . : 14.122878874706544
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , " in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned . : 11.481472321957762
it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could _feel_ gratitude , i would now thank you . : 16.1601561126982
but i cannot -- i have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . : 15.700952499049073
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one . : 23.96669198994268
it has been most unconsciously done , however , and i hope will be of short duration . : 19.32668350111493
the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation ." mr . : 11.566719722525855
darcy , who was leaning against the mantle - piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise . : 9.506679797510134
his complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature . : 15.41659926570432
the pause was to elizabeth ' s feelings dreadful . : 39.09746858041732
at length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , " and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting ! : 15.10613137064762
i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little _endeavour_ at civility , i am thus rejected . : 16.021028377602313
but it is of small importance ." " i might as well enquire ," replied she , " why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? : 11.454053381414
was not this some excuse for incivility , if i _was_ uncivil ? : 14.93659227167884
but i have other provocations . : 49.87778720228348
you know i have . : 182.44722840481754
darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued . : 12.696797640321476
" i have every reason in the world to think ill of you . : 24.186061381261613
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_ . : 7.64114039415201
you dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind ." she paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse . : 9.468228992159668
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity . : 20.104766466405188
" can you deny that you have done it ?" she repeated . : 25.444786838526024
with assumed tranquillity he then replied , " i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that i rejoice in my success . : 14.011212125553138
towards _him_ i have been kinder than towards myself ." elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her . : 8.832945520400205
long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided . : 22.268380298494318
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr . : 14.948413804133509
on this subject , what can you have to say ? : 41.433492641108394
or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ?" " you take an eager interest in that gentleman ' s concerns ," said darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour . : 11.312004600737048
" you have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty . : 16.5830841223449
you have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him . : 17.985842851125287
you have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert . : 16.268017458442067
you have done all this ! : 72.91638478060648
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule ." " and this ," cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , " is your opinion of me ! : 12.31789169207842
i thank you for explaining it so fully . : 27.19743517804655
my faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed ! : 14.948344068269233
but perhaps ," added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . : 10.14427045684277
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had i with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing . : 8.23773739711252
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related . : 28.467234919812228
they were natural and just . : 43.68996318405312
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ? : 24.664921080398575
darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman - like manner ." she saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , " you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it ." again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification . : 11.311361336064339
she went on . : 199.4841844231002
" from the very beginning , from the first moment i may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground - work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry ." " you have said quite enough , madam . : 10.78743243226798
i perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . : 27.953956381506828
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness ." and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house . : 9.65368881119585
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great . : 36.429765243029394
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr . : 14.254904646909594
that he should have been in love with her for so many months ! : 25.67444351535142
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection . : 15.004567261279636
but his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr . : 11.682646860072714
wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited . : 11.266086646219192
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes . : 14.997264421674767
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of mr . : 19.510870303371803
darcy ' s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road . : 12.12566515887574
the park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground . : 14.311292521766697
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park . : 13.157743136641596
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees . : 17.375365814345766
she was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being mr . : 10.206064022415333
but the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name . : 12.322831072041069
she had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be mr . : 17.79208571625894
darcy , she moved again towards the gate . : 27.721801673316033
he had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you . : 11.627857013724833
will you do me the honour of reading that letter ?"-- and then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight . : 12.737717424444352
with no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand .-- the envelope itself was likewise full .-- pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it . : 7.721311066345689
it was dated from rosings , at eight o ' clock in the morning , and was as follows :-- " be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you . : 9.79254540399432
i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . : 11.578130338606268
you must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention ; your feelings , i know , will bestow it unwillingly , but i demand it of your justice . : 11.702232962640725
" two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge . : 14.838944347888265
wickham .-- wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison .-- but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read .-- if , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your ' s , i can only say that i am sorry .-- the necessity must be obeyed -- and farther apology would be absurd .-- i had not been long in hertfordshire , before i saw , in common with others , that bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country .-- but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment .-- i had often seen him in love before .-- at that ball , while i had the honour of dancing with you , i was first made acquainted , by sir william lucas ' s accidental information , that bingley ' s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage . : 10.203444952691164
he spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided . : 24.924113352542957
from that moment i observed my friend ' s behaviour attentively ; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him . : 13.282931473681797
your sister i also watched .-- her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remained convinced from the evening ' s scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .-- if _you_ have not been mistaken here , _i_ must have been in an error . : 9.263663300787575
your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable .-- if it be so , if i have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . : 13.96452301714122
but i shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister ' s countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched .-- that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain ,-- but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears .-- i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it ;-- i believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as i wished it in reason .-- my objections to the marriage were not merely those , which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me .-- but there were other causes of repugnance ;-- causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me .-- these causes must be stated , though briefly .-- the situation of your mother ' s family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father .-- pardon me .-- it pains me to offend you . : 8.520877064619036
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .-- i will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection .-- he left netherfield for london , on the day following , as you , i am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning .-- the part which i acted , is now to be explained .-- his sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london .-- we accordingly went -- and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice .-- i described , and enforced them earnestly .-- but , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving , of your sister ' s indifference . : 9.527211288204642
he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard .-- but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own .-- to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point . : 10.600917184360913
to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment .-- i cannot blame myself for having done thus much . : 13.207197293827974
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which i do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister ' s being in town . : 11.050112695402975
i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it .-- that they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ;-- but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger .-- perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me .-- it is done , however , and it was done for the best .-- on this subject i have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer . : 11.541093264867248
if i have wounded your sister ' s feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them .-- with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured mr . : 8.633050078552623
wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . : 15.080488523834441
of what he has _particularly_ accused me i am ignorant ; but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity . : 14.137289987247879
wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on george wickham , who was his god - son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . : 11.110032018395565
my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge ;-- most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ' s education . : 12.157513890406527
as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner . : 19.785253404276585
darcy could not have . : 140.4941116347271
here again i shall give you pain -- to what degree you only can tell . : 12.398130324246921
wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character . : 9.904971899917483
it adds even another motive . : 36.399626637883586
my excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to mr . : 14.057901611320622
wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant . : 12.100227724043533
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds . : 14.082165235725668
his own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , mr . : 14.318068085396922
he had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein . : 14.753887148592185
i rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal . : 16.796547723847837
i knew that mr . : 66.62672468068014
wickham ought not to be a clergyman . : 42.20824390198117
in town i believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation . : 11.299190907177083
for about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation . : 15.438827869864177
his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad . : 22.65147860170686
he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question -- of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father ' s intentions . : 12.01328987634546
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it . : 9.949874294816874
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances -- and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself . : 16.596893166133142
after this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt . : 16.54770613826494
how he lived i know not . : 33.549582683412375
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . : 17.530119998856243
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being . : 12.58977752838373
having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy . : 20.888552061941517
about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went mr . : 13.477738919176769
wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs . : 9.882952686804213
younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement . : 10.819428951931558
she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself . : 13.905057845481053
i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me . : 9.459221805430998
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted . : 29.17141978098428
regard for my sister ' s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to mr . : 9.876031948138868
wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs . : 26.907627948493207
his revenge would have been complete indeed . : 34.84685466645896
this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr . : 10.39550142308286
i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at . : 14.81549492467223
ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination . : 14.80255176048061
but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . : 17.780909684172276
for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father ' s will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions . : 10.169961647228856
if your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . : 10.203509835717522
i will only add , god bless you . : 17.543540139136272
" fitzwilliam darcy ." chapter xiii . : 40.86546277609111
if elizabeth , when mr . : 78.4064388881541
darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents . : 15.74480027064078
but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited . : 12.723624053117963
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined . : 33.75493436282059
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal . : 14.26565568051692
with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at netherfield . : 16.967135423005487
she read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes . : 11.856160117749997
his belief of her sister ' s insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice . : 17.230870641287307
he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty . : 13.754825262540372
it was all pride and insolence . : 35.58219116594146
wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition . : 9.190886232283244
astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her . : 16.30134515495791
she wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " this must be false ! : 15.74021824705279
this cannot be ! : 207.96847829611954
this must be the grossest falsehood !"-- and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again . : 12.72301400012592
in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence . : 11.808365919213614
the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late mr . : 24.528689386996195
what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err . : 13.13803565203702
she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality -- deliberated on the probability of each statement -- but with little success . : 11.16348371568794
on both sides it was only assertion . : 34.875716009110675
wickham ' s charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice . : 13.891302613212273
she had never heard of him before his entrance into the ---- shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance . : 13.21990259201428
as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring . : 19.64627693103724
his countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue . : 27.11873561953918
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of mr . : 7.51944065347505
darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what mr . : 9.316376837810841
darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance . : 12.96895633514761
but no such recollection befriended her . : 28.057025389430027
she could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess . : 12.07022693930797
after pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read . : 16.40980817562738
but , alas ! : 104.41886618230315
the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself -- from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin ' s affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question . : 11.664812159274973
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr . : 13.8231057937765
darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin ' s corroboration . : 15.687040541150349
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself , in their first evening at mr . : 17.236232877978757
philips ' s . : 80.33165638376231
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct . : 14.470098687203762
darcy might leave the country , but that _he_ should stand his ground ; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week . : 10.213956236882982
darcy ' s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son . : 16.56145443113527
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned ! : 20.106208442375515
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing . : 10.189019085479273
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn . : 10.743084900997927
darcy , she could not but allow that mr . : 20.47416770197507
bingley , when questioned by jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ; that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust -- any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits . : 8.828710324035596
that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued -- that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling . : 10.780853715548066
that had his actions been what wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as mr . : 11.077930218166616
bingley , was incomprehensible . : 104.89057757167801
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself .-- of neither darcy nor wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd . : 8.540776537685446
" how despicably have i acted !" she cried .--" i , who have prided myself on my discernment !-- i , who have valued myself on my abilities ! : 9.558151115774772
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust .-- how humiliating is this discovery !-- yet , how just a humiliation !-- had i been in love , i could not have been more wretchedly blind . : 8.33396434706379
till this moment , i never knew myself ." from herself to jane -- from jane to bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr . : 13.337829153408999
darcy ' s explanation _there_ , had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again . : 16.764423253675425
widely different was the effect of a second perusal .-- how could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ?-- he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister ' s attachment ;-- and she could not help remembering what charlotte ' s opinion had always been .-- neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane .-- she felt that jane ' s feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility . : 9.483818587071362
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe . : 13.70108718870225
the compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt . : 42.98323777191239
it soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self - attracted by the rest of her family ;-- and as she considered that jane ' s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before . : 11.38558026238645
after wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ; re - considering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation . : 8.867351185115647
she was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence ; mr . : 11.025905264360585
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning ; and mr . : 17.623556857801574
to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine , and her daughter ; and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her . : 13.035445580496868
" what would she have said ?-- how would she have behaved ?" were questions with which she amused herself . : 9.021978042640011
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party .--" i assure you , i feel it exceedingly ," said lady catherine ; " i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do . : 12.064220937290536
but i am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me !-- they were excessively sorry to go ! : 16.579278517748065
but so they always are . : 46.2699100295948
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more i think than last year . : 10.814831778146035
his attachment to rosings , certainly increases ." mr . : 17.20529773016311
collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter . : 15.768646929950526
lady catherine observed , after dinner , that miss bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , " but if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . : 14.786676449520687
i expected you to stay two months . : 34.84085375084461
i told mrs . : 139.55950085743441
collins so before you came . : 44.79851682778305
there can be no occasion for your going so soon . : 22.246720092011117
bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight ." " but my father cannot .-- he wrote last week to hurry my return ." " oh ! : 8.910742684466214
" mrs . : 371.9676120527918
collins , you must send a servant with them . : 22.02684143621137
you know i always speak my mind , and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . : 12.790602483603777
it is highly improper . : 59.365506103048126
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing .-- young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life . : 9.018165843382095
when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer , i made a point of her having two men servants go with her .-- miss darcy , the daughter of mr . : 12.335725338055738
you must send john with the young ladies , mrs . : 19.156124456247618
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone ." " my uncle is to send a servant for us ." " oh !-- your uncle !-- he keeps a man - servant , does he ?-- i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things . : 9.321711790294422
where shall you change horses ?-- oh ! : 15.102874599172777
bromley , of course .-- if you mention my name at the bell , you will be attended to ." lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was . : 11.188749607053078
darcy ' s letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart . : 16.28896467772773
she studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different . : 14.760223873232908
when she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion . : 10.216024941857784
his attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again . : 9.51899094020354
they were hopeless of remedy . : 34.057214703389775
her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil . : 12.628074159929612
catherine , weak - spirited , irritable , and completely under lydia ' s guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and lydia , self - willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing . : 8.591837627809893
they were ignorant , idle , and vain . : 31.27766748292375
while there was an officer in meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn , they would be going there for ever . : 13.819725978512531
anxiety on jane ' s behalf , was another prevailing concern , and mr . : 15.659480517278931
darcy ' s explanation , by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what jane had lost . : 13.65669749030815
his affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend . : 13.427366978834723
when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham ' s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful . : 10.271074322672005
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first . : 16.136600839366675
the very last evening was spent there ; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh . : 11.146231362196865
when they parted , lady catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to hunsford again next year ; and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both . : 9.826163083537162
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr . : 27.325988154744696
collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary . : 9.230350295324222
" i know not , miss elizabeth ," said he , " whether mrs . : 20.794184280867203
collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . : 12.049463670507127
the favour of your company has been much felt , i assure you . : 27.300954411070887
we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode . : 21.657633294306233
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make _her_ feel the obliged . : 14.003774720958917
collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied , " it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably . : 12.979871156017293
we have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome . : 9.541060478107491
our situation with regard to lady catherine ' s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . : 7.361252761850311
you see on what a footing we are . : 32.23802642132947
you see how continually we are engaged there . : 27.230316674810595
in truth i must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings ." words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences . : 10.508243413237802
" you may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire , my dear cousin . : 14.68940520764097
i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so . : 25.91438512150456
lady catherine ' s great attentions to mrs . : 19.440962374207036
collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate -- but on this point it will be as well to be silent . : 11.63179793256222
only let me assure you , my dear miss elizabeth , that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . : 12.649408535320477
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking . : 17.788255955354515
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us . : 15.514491327589939
we seem to have been designed for each other ." elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts . : 10.71041197357855
she was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung . : 15.861434231152844
poor charlotte !-- it was melancholy to leave her to such society !-- but she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion . : 12.18887704199713
her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms . : 14.917637926582064
after an affectionate parting between the friends , elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr . : 17.46135154821189
collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to mr . : 14.468212953411253
gardiner , though unknown . : 71.05645312804259
" but ," he added , " you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here ." elizabeth made no objection ;-- the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off . : 12.875818293493937
" good gracious !" cried maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but a day or two since we first came !-- and yet how many things have happened !" " a great many indeed ," said her companion with a sigh . : 9.821161544411908
" we have dined nine times at rosings , besides drinking tea there twice !-- how much i shall have to tell !" elizabeth privately added , " and how much i shall have to conceal ." their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving hunsford , they reached mr . : 8.727843830490608
gardiner ' s house , where they were to remain a few days . : 22.025071242302158
jane looked well , and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them . : 11.57014387665536
but jane was to go home with her , and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation . : 22.261083612498144
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn , before she told her sister of mr . : 12.685625599896566
darcy ' s proposals . : 67.91833990574698
to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther . : 11.29552589665189
it was the second week in may , in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch - street , for the town of ---- in hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the appointed inn where mr . : 9.241212041430193
bennet ' s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman ' s punctuality , both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining - room up stairs . : 13.96890605015089
these two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a sallad and cucumber . : 7.559304098780672
after welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , " is not this nice ? : 7.91896888745519
is not this an agreeable surprise ?" " and we mean to treat you all ," added lydia ; " but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there ." then shewing her purchases : " look here , i have bought this bonnet . : 9.33418937567213
i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home , and see if i can make it up any better ." and when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , " oh ! : 12.60877106954127
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and when i have bought some prettier - coloured satin to trim it with fresh , i think it will be very tolerable . : 10.49651318933589
" they are going to be encamped near brighton ; and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! : 15.49777335853923
it would be such a delicious scheme , and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all . : 15.204730917541447
mamma would like to go too of all things ! : 19.610522972596684
only think what a miserable summer else we shall have !" " yes ," thought elizabeth , " _that_ would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once . : 12.390030536892263
good heaven ! : 208.53505165772796
brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of meryton ." " now i have got some news for you ," said lydia , as they sat down to table . : 10.308742413498218
" what do you think ? : 67.56040898443771
it is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like ." jane and elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay . : 11.953516438421945
lydia laughed , and said , " aye , that is just like your formality and discretion . : 18.0289089089173
i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say . : 12.323295346504068
but he is an ugly fellow ! : 41.793151401674656
i am glad he is gone . : 50.395836455318154
i never saw such a long chin in my life . : 22.900375123698435
well , but now for my news : it is about dear wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ? : 17.112562059027717
there is no danger of wickham ' s marrying mary king . : 17.41177854884032
there ' s for you ! : 119.60943050879142
she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool ; gone to stay . : 21.773277301295686
wickham is safe ." " and mary king is safe !" added elizabeth ; " safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune ." " she is a great fool for going away , if she liked him ." " but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side ," said jane . : 10.336964911823854
i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her . : 15.619903385334759
who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing ?" elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself , the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal ! : 8.824505790119828
as soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ; and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of kitty ' s and lydia ' s purchases , were seated in it . : 11.598008352850131
" how nicely we are crammed in !" cried lydia . : 16.907474004391503
" i am glad i bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox ! : 11.899728330965962
well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home . : 13.201094420659523
have you seen any pleasant men ? : 28.22151891730472
have you had any flirting ? : 80.51978888775513
i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back . : 18.380423510173404
jane will be quite an old maid soon , i declare . : 24.195893483373354
she is almost three and twenty ! : 33.833329968237955
my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands , you can ' t think . : 14.272800310802344
she says lizzy had better have taken mr . : 21.363036837918884
collins ; but _i_ do not think there would have been any fun in it . : 18.332760379913754
lord ! : 323.8389334515628
how i should like to be married before any of you ; and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls . : 17.07531692717581
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster ' s . : 15.830671869340327
kitty and me were to spend the day there , and mrs . : 21.085970981528785
forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; ( by the bye , mrs . : 15.24807368114779
forster and me are _such_ friends !) and so she asked the two harringtons to come , but harriet was ill , and so pen was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? : 11.195208934217764
not a soul knew of it , but col . : 34.202011582070874
when denny , and wickham , and pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least . : 23.004845949108443
how i laughed ! : 96.07093386971907
and so did mrs . : 72.39215184540387
forster . : 1584.7619087021997
i thought i should have died . : 50.931689991483715
and _that_ made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter ." with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes , did lydia , assisted by kitty ' s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn . : 9.891105722993595
elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham ' s name . : 15.185521741217906
their reception at home was most kind . : 36.64435779954663
bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did mr . : 13.348362766730054
bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth , " i am glad you are come back , lizzy ." their party in the dining - room was large , for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news : and various were the subjects which occupied them ; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; mrs . : 8.848812226412322
bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger miss lucases ; and lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person ' s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her . : 11.246112003093055
as we went along , kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and i should have gone so all the way , if kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the george , i do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . : 11.604570753863813
and then when we came away it was such fun ! : 27.3742787596125
i thought we never should have got into the coach . : 28.883086231712333
i was ready to die of laughter . : 27.033138925974963
and then we were so merry all the way home ! : 28.181247658106372
we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off !" to this , mary very gravely replied , " far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures . : 9.909239721425124
they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds . : 12.428165130169912
but i confess they would have no charms for _me_ . : 25.782911861161022
she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to mary at all . : 14.782413536248178
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on ; but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme . : 11.815430597856919
it should not be said , that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers . : 21.816591176291883
there was another reason too for her opposition . : 23.9493542697996
she dreaded seeing wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible . : 18.261974754019924
the comfort to _her_ , of the regiment ' s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression . : 21.055045045785537
in a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account . : 20.245140802199113
she had not been many hours at home , before she found that the brighton scheme , of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents . : 12.416882906396163
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last . : 10.010208239351147
elizabeth ' s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr . : 11.32414859520439
darcy and herself . : 109.1762514162074
miss bennet ' s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings . : 8.765924960088174
she was sorry that mr . : 44.303999407245904
darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ' s refusal must have given him . : 11.692780019136078
you do not blame me , however , for refusing him ?" " blame you ! : 22.52005915094661
oh , no ." " but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham ." " no -- i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did ." " but you _will_ know it , when i have told you what happened the very next day ." she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham . : 10.85020889012535
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here collected in one individual . : 9.391866549782327
nor was darcy ' s vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery . : 13.905019454660543
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other . : 10.535930499801298
" this will not do ," said elizabeth . : 38.31705310786424
" you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing . : 21.517609378683037
take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . : 26.04532551514986
there is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much . : 10.46605739510501
for my part , i am inclined to believe it all mr . : 20.667798453925062
darcy ' s , but you shall do as you chuse ." it was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from jane . : 15.4689806401522
" i do not know when i have been more shocked ," said she . : 17.817971675809524
dear lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered . : 24.09112111421327
such a disappointment ! : 109.94611159498211
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too ! : 35.25254550607319
and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! : 40.707098844986554
it is really too distressing . : 40.914953367221514
i am sure you must feel it so ." " oh ! : 20.63768012433864
i know you will do him such ample justice , that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . : 12.076330695958227
your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather ." " poor wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance ! : 12.058158703403144
such an openness and gentleness in his manner ." " there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men . : 11.997693117232812
one has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it ." " i never thought mr . : 19.114134626299432
darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do ." " and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason . : 13.344792792930312
one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty ." " lizzy , when you first read that letter , i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now ." " indeed i could not . : 11.702430366265983
i was uncomfortable enough . : 70.0445538076017
i was very uncomfortable , i may say unhappy . : 31.36121655807382
how i wanted you !" " how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr . : 10.083679492859176
darcy , for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved ." " certainly . : 15.819209671999731
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging . : 16.221475918533123
there is one point , on which i want your advice . : 25.920598471881092
i want to be told whether i ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham ' s character ." miss bennet paused a little and then replied , " surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . : 11.55595162437444
darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public . : 20.794445545336533
the general prejudice against mr . : 46.1283230838405
darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light . : 15.928905320921977
i am not equal to it . : 42.20266418045086
wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is . : 14.921163060917712
sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . : 9.044969985626652
at present i will say nothing about it ." " you are quite right . : 18.17716972503652
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re - establish a character . : 14.797860611517306
we must not make him desperate ." the tumult of elizabeth ' s mind was allayed by this conversation . : 12.976332360446385
she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either . : 14.180794946283687
but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure . : 11.98609300758574
she dared not relate the other half of mr . : 21.01286127670209
" and then ," said she , " if that very improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . : 11.080007586734611
the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value !" she was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister ' s spirits . : 12.60322212197327
jane was not happy . : 107.6603199630925
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley . : 25.53155114233599
" well , lizzy ," said mrs . : 30.378554024648448
bennet one day , " what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of jane ' s ? : 19.08604092317592
for my part , i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody . : 20.87672077461469
i told my sister philips so the other day . : 26.3834607845011
but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london . : 24.093051826607997
well , he is a very undeserving young man -- and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . : 16.80468742518531
it is just as he chooses . : 53.92680659948006
nobody wants him to come . : 44.52622568785593
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if i was her , i would not have put up with it . : 16.204923096513788
well , my comfort is , i am sure jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done ." but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer . : 12.87515279995154
" well , lizzy ," continued her mother soon afterwards , " and so the collinses live very comfortable , do they ? : 17.021249608494905
and what sort of table do they keep ? : 24.858346203823835
if she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough . : 19.228709016308958
there is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping , i dare say ." " no , nothing at all ." " a great deal of good management , depend upon it . : 10.312123915192492
yes , yes . : 83.42625694929782
_they_ will take care not to outrun their income . : 12.994384316545448
_they_ will never be distressed for money . : 14.53938498384036
well , much good may it do them ! : 18.628079886920467
and so , i suppose , they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead . : 17.64969263491788
it would have been strange if they had . : 33.18063992907321
but i make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves . : 20.410534386843707
well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better . : 17.79132999470453
the first week of their return was soon gone . : 31.838601217862795
it was the last of the regiment ' s stay in meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace . : 19.349228122918262
the dejection was almost universal . : 52.96321521611257
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments . : 13.388614221240562
very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard - heartedness in any of the family . : 9.052123541580674
" good heaven ! : 126.50076501065529
what are we to do !" would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe . : 12.164021558176293
" how can you be smiling so , lizzy ?" their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago . : 8.11742500085808
" i am sure ," said she , " i cried for two days together when colonel millar ' s regiment went away . : 9.456719810026243
" if one could but go to brighton !" observed mrs . : 14.272993129631121
" oh , yes !-- if one could but go to brighton ! : 15.077901727563663
but papa is so disagreeable ." " a little sea - bathing would set me up for ever ." " and my aunt philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good ," added kitty . : 9.094844131760599
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn - house . : 11.221362190515638
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame . : 16.890755876853465
darcy ' s objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend . : 15.776937756250735
but the gloom of lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from mrs . : 11.363292930882857
forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to brighton . : 25.510855062531267
this invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married . : 23.58666334861729
a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other , and out of their _three_ months ' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_ . : 11.828390939623402
the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of mrs . : 20.622430794180453
bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be described . : 23.915647246459272
" i cannot see why mrs . : 28.08582970748992
forster should not ask _me_ as well as lydia ," said she , " though i am _not_ her particular friend . : 12.523791772574787
i have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for i am two years older ." in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and jane to make her resigned . : 16.65939368770555
as for elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia , that she considered it as the death - warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go . : 12.842247054927409
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia ' s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs . : 14.486459887021828
forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home . : 12.215839215419827
he heard her attentively , and then said , " lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances ." " if you were aware ," said elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of lydia ' s unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , i am sure you would judge differently in the affair ." " already arisen !" repeated mr . : 10.29015888003085
" what , has she frightened away some of your lovers ? : 24.11018398490987
poor little lizzy ! : 59.015205540661476
but do not be cast down . : 52.719609142983806
such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret . : 13.258193316676468
come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia ' s folly ." " indeed you are mistaken . : 11.996685527380118
it is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which i am now complaining . : 19.242964767419934
our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia ' s character . : 11.251034629260642
excuse me -- for i must speak plainly . : 25.610216862556253
her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous . : 18.326543169799905
a flirt too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . : 8.013921626194717
she will follow wherever lydia leads . : 24.88803907741482
vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled ! : 16.7987080577917
my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ?" mr . : 13.00773830182422
bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , " do not make yourself uneasy , my love . : 14.723784342719899
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton . : 15.822739184175738
let her go then . : 37.699770060799935
colonel forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body . : 11.906012255778055
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here . : 15.524184656045202
the officers will find women better worth their notice . : 15.673368380738202
let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance . : 17.312520876297462
at any rate , she cannot grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life ." with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry . : 10.470342816108598
it was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them . : 16.615098541897066
she was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition . : 12.687702522752241
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility . : 12.11233767868291
she saw with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers . : 11.00311724999239
she saw all the glories of the camp ; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet ; and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once . : 7.623658492801474
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ? : 12.239223109356724
lydia ' s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband ' s never intending to go there himself . : 13.499601443683177
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia ' s leaving home . : 13.002110697201486
elizabeth was now to see mr . : 49.92493229113089
having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the agitations of former partiality entirely so . : 7.297000276297243
she had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary . : 10.996771323127122
in his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her . : 10.234435231055105
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal . : 9.964006103405701
on the very last day of the regiment ' s remaining in meryton , he dined with others of the officers at longbourn ; and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford , she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam ' s and mr . : 12.366539918488128
darcy ' s having both spent three weeks at rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former . : 13.562506130056475
he looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment ' s recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and after observing that he was a very gentleman - like man , asked her how she had liked him . : 13.082930565954692
her answer was warmly in his favour . : 33.07508027401615
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " how long did you say that he was at rosings ?" " nearly three weeks ." " and you saw him frequently ?" " yes , almost every day ." " his manners are very different from his cousin ' s ." " yes , very different . : 12.488200010593614
but i think mr . : 83.48378315756108
darcy improves on acquaintance ." " indeed !" cried wickham with a look which did not escape her . : 14.868346583142495
" and pray may i ask ?" but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , " is it in address that he improves ? : 14.596246421969447
has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ? : 13.64614196446579
for i dare not hope ," he continued in a lower and more serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials ." " oh , no !" said elizabeth . : 12.688571369519197
" in essentials , i believe , he is very much what he ever was ." while she spoke , wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning . : 10.941983900517467
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added , " when i said that he improved on acquaintance , i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood ." wickham ' s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents , " you , who so well know my feelings towards mr . : 9.729579957837222
darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right . : 11.771144631658748
his pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by . : 17.14605681583707
i only fear that the sort of cautiousness , to which you , i imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe . : 12.257742395673848
his fear of her , has always operated , i know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh , which i am certain he has very much at heart ." elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head . : 13.646907146752653
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him . : 16.10569667752364
when the party broke up , lydia returned with mrs . : 15.432766014244327
forster to meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning . : 16.0548124858442
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic . : 18.11635824516964
kitty was the only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy . : 11.634852449885887
bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard . : 10.988153048546216
had elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort . : 12.449168612960632
her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her . : 9.611583945525165
but mr . : 211.8325833808815
bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice . : 9.33549231641636
this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given . : 9.700722329383249
she had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible . : 11.667958659588388
but she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill - judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife . : 7.321452508152661
their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp . : 8.085804926659351
upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself . : 12.90844800633606
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment . : 9.59845630655134
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect . : 13.344214462795556
" but it is fortunate ," thought she , " that i have something to wish for . : 19.02603849214769
were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . : 26.393370156371986
but here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister ' s absence , i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized . : 13.746547972963292
a scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation ." when lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short . : 9.967404775450072
those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as mrs . : 10.318764110417867
forster called her , and they were going to the camp ;-- and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt -- for her letters to kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public . : 13.943440132185236
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re - appear at longbourn . : 11.648648865069875
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose . : 15.792219341830963
bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope , that by the following christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war - office , another regiment should be quartered in meryton . : 8.567263486067331
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from mrs . : 12.980194906886007
gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent . : 10.845273455524767
gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july , and must be in london again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than derbyshire . : 10.776222076891361
gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction . : 27.765328813149043
the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of matlock , chatsworth , dovedale , or the peak . : 11.693255930534052
elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough . : 13.11863510381385
but it was her business to be satisfied -- and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again . : 18.044480898453724
with the mention of derbyshire , there were many ideas connected . : 20.484847758050183
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner . : 17.052395905654077
" but surely ," said she , " i may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me ." the period of expectation was now doubled . : 9.08064326220203
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt ' s arrival . : 16.8425832951429
but they did pass away , and mr . : 32.40465525854458
gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at longbourn . : 18.813744925367594
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn , and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement . : 13.42554345495194
one enjoyment was certain -- that of suitableness as companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences -- cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure -- and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad . : 5.892020535887128
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; oxford , blenheim , warwick , kenelworth , birmingham , & c . : 6.62642072547759
are sufficiently known . : 104.2468861988232
a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern . : 33.217395931803814
to the little town of lambton , the scene of mrs . : 23.39468428268655
in talking over their route the evening before , mrs . : 20.50014353420083
gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again . : 19.011776622108133
gardiner declared his willingness , and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation . : 20.83865898395375
" my love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ?" said her aunt . : 23.187321413696043
" a place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected . : 24.704510002500417
wickham passed all his youth there , you know ." elizabeth was distressed . : 23.542730609703224
she felt that she had no business at pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it . : 12.889307177259017
she must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains . : 9.819111940453592
they have some of the finest woods in the country ." elizabeth said no more -- but her mind could not acquiesce . : 18.73671510732068
the possibility of meeting mr . : 49.64603546154367
darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred . : 21.57486452480634
it would be dreadful ! : 79.66476474643612
she blushed at the very idea ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk . : 20.419052939451014
but against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered . : 15.144292907991362
accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer . : 12.261640309786777
a most welcome negative followed the last question -- and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme . : 11.486472646543685
iii . : 280.4560503827073
[ illustration : dove - dale ] pride & prejudice . : 5.518786785957596
the park was very large , and contained great variety of ground . : 26.30461167770562
they entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent . : 9.662795509963763
elizabeth ' s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view . : 11.714894634034257
it was a large , handsome , stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills ;-- and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance . : 7.139303076946918
its banks were neither formal , nor falsely adorned . : 12.570314455541144
elizabeth was delighted . : 142.59020433457303
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste . : 10.927855172488142
they descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned . : 10.869695864527586
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken . : 27.376758593567345
on applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was . : 17.966570495466453
the housekeeper came ; a respectable - looking , elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her . : 13.14481252987322
they followed her into the dining - parlour . : 26.224009026901644
it was a large , well - proportioned room , handsomely fitted up . : 14.173569695298013
elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect . : 16.703138766227468
the hill , crowned with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object . : 11.790524249730543
every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight . : 16.703315368283555
as they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different positions ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen . : 8.825669591849936
" and of this place ," thought she , " i might have been mistress ! : 26.013616566604878
with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted ! : 21.956033605540476
instead of viewing them as a stranger , i might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt .-- but no ,"-- recollecting herself ,--" that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me : i should not have been allowed to invite them ." this was a lucky recollection -- it saved her from something like regret . : 9.140426846466186
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it . : 14.500027340715445
at length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while mrs . : 16.07531753038298
reynolds replied , that he was , adding , " but we expect him to - morrow , with a large party of friends ." how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! : 10.767309846083448
her aunt now called her to look at a picture . : 30.60440099896425
she approached , and saw the likeness of mr . : 27.20460792789449
wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle - piece . : 8.722699710732709
her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it . : 25.382058846861035
the housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master ' s steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence .--" he is now gone into the army ," she added , " but i am afraid he has turned out very wild ." mrs . : 11.225716196515206
gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but elizabeth could not return it . : 21.833503779271517
" and that ," said mrs . : 50.77452599286479
reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master -- and very like him . : 14.869186701019714
it was drawn at the same time as the other -- about eight years ago ." " i have heard much of your master ' s fine person ," said mrs . : 12.216915710054234
but , lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not ." mrs . : 16.104802567871015
reynolds ' s respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master . : 14.613699783107233
" does that young lady know mr . : 24.729559897956687
darcy ?" elizabeth coloured , and said --" a little ." " and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , ma ' am ?" " yes , very handsome ." " i am sure _i_ know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . : 10.287508433708304
this room was my late master ' s favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . : 16.200922592440936
he was very fond of them ." this accounted to elizabeth for mr . : 19.92901355464328
reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old . : 13.256941001043824
" and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother ?" said mr . : 23.088489439660997
yes -- the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished !-- she plays and sings all day long . : 8.128838839696696
in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her -- a present from my master ; she comes here to - morrow with him ." mr . : 11.62920583720167
reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister . : 11.91460011059318
" is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year ?" " not so much as i could wish , sir ; but i dare say he may spend half his time here ; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months ." " except ," thought elizabeth , " when she goes to ramsgate ." " if your master would marry , you might see more of him ." " yes , sir ; but i do not know when _that_ will be . : 11.848310012434242
i do not know who is good enough for him ." mr . : 17.213796803478147
elizabeth could not help saying , " it is very much to his credit , i am sure , that you should think so ." " i say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him ," replied the other . : 14.66794119504861
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , " i have never had a cross word from him in my life , and i have known him ever since he was four years old ." this was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas . : 10.903975356772774
her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , " there are very few people of whom so much can be said . : 15.06776784235769
you are lucky in having such a master ." " yes , sir , i know i am . : 21.28403030585497
if i was to go through the world , i could not meet with a better . : 31.265047812189504
but i have always observed , that they who are good - natured when children , are good - natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest - tempered , most generous - hearted , boy in the world ." elizabeth almost stared at her .--" can this be mr . : 8.498572849632959
darcy !" thought she . : 85.86406097477378
" his father was an excellent man ," said mrs . : 25.14259992885036
" yes , ma ' am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him -- just as affable to the poor ." elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more . : 11.767868561018346
reynolds could interest her on no other point . : 15.874958016009876
she related the subject of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain . : 23.794922563057074
gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase . : 10.160639329063837
" he is the best landlord , and the best master ," said she , " that ever lived . : 18.934916320288885
not like the wild young men now - a - days , who think of nothing but themselves . : 13.448432237070302
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name . : 18.320592706961595
some people call him proud ; but i am sure i never saw any thing of it . : 13.31418881761719
to my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men ." " in what an amiable light does this place him !" thought elizabeth . : 11.334694446270746
" this fine account of him ," whispered her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend ." " perhaps we might be deceived ." " that is not very likely ; our authority was too good ." on reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting - room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to miss darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at pemberley . : 9.549756406158503
" he is certainly a good brother ," said elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows . : 20.95507119220018
reynolds anticipated miss darcy ' s delight , when she should enter the room . : 16.636909074552992
" and this is always the way with him ," she added .--" whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment . : 14.590039409714032
there is nothing he would not do for her ." the picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed - rooms , were all that remained to be shewn . : 16.295282589425245
in the former were many good paintings ; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy ' s , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible . : 10.693861102597278
in the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger . : 15.503585886052466
elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her . : 19.0462695728325
at last it arrested her -- and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr . : 11.367724935321894
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs . : 33.37264122977586
reynolds was of no trifling nature . : 22.21766126289585
what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ? : 18.107934079794237
every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression . : 11.655310310850052
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door . : 14.41104208906273
as they walked across the lawn towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables . : 11.440128745900477
they were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight . : 11.388286132748668
their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush . : 14.470293226855336
he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility . : 14.042849813233422
had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr . : 12.351579066935104
darcy , the gardener ' s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it . : 15.165950952074589
they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family . : 10.418072855824915
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life . : 12.470273685804674
nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts . : 12.613070771652652
at length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave . : 12.725688452726171
the others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence . : 14.876613110122031
she was overpowered by shame and vexation . : 20.907834780455907
her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill - judged thing in the world ! : 27.732509063170845
how strange must it appear to him ! : 31.189029863303112
it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again ! : 21.195509390645565
why did she come ? : 54.673145046338774
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? : 22.85682026979282
had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage . : 12.591270277764686
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting . : 22.571173166957966
and his behaviour , so strikingly altered ,-- what could it mean ? : 17.913548050922667
that he should even speak to her was amazing !-- but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family ! : 17.47932237980193
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting . : 11.441332130207387
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing ' s park , when he put his letter into her hand ! : 12.804748656072162
she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it . : 19.898777382104324
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene . : 11.261132727887134
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr . : 14.896636782962103
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him . : 15.09847173465875
perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been _that_ in his voice , which was not like ease . : 14.964316082020428
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure . : 15.296003969279502
at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself . : 12.696369806104123
they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream . : 10.105770326899476
gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk . : 15.517467414175547
with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round . : 19.931666756213232
it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts . : 12.784989469038353
they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice - wood which bordered it . : 7.976665524403409
elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs . : 11.297828741563158
gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible . : 13.576067975058153
her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr . : 13.285089971474507
gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little . : 13.75152453687159
whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth ' s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr . : 13.541026442631269
darcy approaching them , and at no great distance . : 33.67242547622746
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met . : 17.61568079741282
elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them . : 13.292360030452778
for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path . : 15.616669874816616
this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them . : 10.854229091579231
with a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words " delightful ," and " charming ," when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed . : 10.793928707788961
her colour changed , and she said no more . : 36.47803113617677
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself . : 10.842974394494416
" what will be his surprise ," thought she , " when he knows who they are ! : 20.265932571617704
he takes them now for people of fashion ." the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions . : 10.438693306749851
elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph . : 21.719294092252046
it was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush . : 12.449829095671126
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners . : 14.775902827689372
darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport . : 11.302477413965406
gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder . : 13.853038418185681
elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself . : 18.964987284686625
from what can it proceed ? : 56.132545267664796
it cannot be for _me_ , it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened . : 16.01575352169684
my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this . : 21.76670555913862
it is impossible that he should still love me ." after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water - plant , there chanced to be a little alteration . : 10.529744501767304
it originated in mrs . : 54.154326865232505
gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeth ' s arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband ' s . : 12.828220088555193
darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together . : 22.913891351423135
after a short silence , the lady first spoke . : 24.80364357885838
she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected --" for your housekeeper ," she added , " informed us that you would certainly not be here till to - morrow ; and indeed , before we left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country ." he acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling . : 10.944211888067128
bingley and his sisters ." elizabeth answered only by a slight bow . : 20.88594004540745
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr . : 18.708117586860382
bingley ' s name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , _his_ mind was not very differently engaged . : 12.079259816960354
" there is also one other person in the party ," he continued after a pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you ,-- will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ?" the surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it . : 10.583939103445235
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her . : 14.55154813642341
they now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought . : 15.68122629015707
elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased . : 21.29329004728423
his wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind . : 30.37705939423631
they soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , mr . : 18.945900428358005
gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind . : 24.139419775603102
he then asked her to walk into the house -- but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn . : 17.58256820775199
at such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward . : 26.910647948235535
she wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject . : 18.876689617784557
at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance . : 12.425375543166366
yet time and her aunt moved slowly -- and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tãªte - ã - tãªte was over . : 9.226753665390829
on mr . : 195.36209662781184
gardiner ' s coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness . : 11.861175401261288
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected . : 17.81782608003481
i can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , _i_ have seen nothing of it ." " i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . : 11.336340675487572
it was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . : 17.8815507583814
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling ." " to be sure , lizzy ," said her aunt , " he is not so handsome as wickham ; or rather he has not wickham ' s countenance , for his features are perfectly good . : 15.989766938457525
but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ?" elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning . : 12.144264400941394
" but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities ," replied her uncle . : 25.077611782445683
" your great men often are ; and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds ." elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing . : 11.526232482074477
" from what we have seen of him ," continued mrs . : 29.007926881291727
he has not an ill - natured look . : 27.854222723768604
on the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks . : 12.374244932329763
but to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most flaming character ! : 17.30436401549578
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . : 24.1719421462433
but he is a liberal master , i suppose , and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue ." elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor wickham ' s so amiable , as they had been considered in hertfordshire . : 12.189081691311843
in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on . : 13.278631440241831
gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else . : 11.342539093651613
fatigued as she had been by the morning ' s walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance . : 13.189643872254464
darcy ' s civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister . : 27.289342341097644
elizabeth had settled it that mr . : 26.451077406736108
darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . : 16.37918162003043
but her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton , these visitors came . : 11.52703323449247
elizabeth immediately recognising the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected . : 12.430814367360593
her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business . : 16.120509216339432
nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece . : 13.131065660825499
while these newly - born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of elizabeth ' s feelings was every moment increasing . : 8.52495090060951
miss darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place . : 22.715172295407708
since her being at lambton , she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy . : 14.811174383437098
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable . : 14.777417046091351
miss darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful . : 12.972932511820051
she was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle . : 14.443518324804414
elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr . : 11.54580748748435
they had not been long together , before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when bingley ' s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . : 12.788097821530673
all elizabeth ' s anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again . : 12.464324663701573
he enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good - humoured ease that he had ever done . : 16.863126934421864
gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself . : 17.604139574486172
the whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention . : 18.94875544545982
the suspicions which had just arisen of mr . : 26.100541448558083
darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love . : 10.852254157853745
of the lady ' s sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough . : 11.802813971164772
elizabeth , on her side , had much to do . : 47.05193233848149
bingley was ready , georgiana was eager , and darcy determined , to be pleased . : 20.09419441566105
in seeing bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh ! : 25.873091153097512
how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner . : 18.137984110565
but , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy , who had been set up as a rival of jane . : 14.856667994279986
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister . : 18.421031639509902
he observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ;" and , before she could reply , he added , " it is above eight months . : 14.191367579136738
there was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning . : 18.49340429702213
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr . : 20.506583824963695
darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day . : 10.701126069700862
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible . : 10.528196248118723
never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self - consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings . : 9.900703424849496
their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , mr . : 12.03002338969186
darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr . : 20.152011550599134
gardiner , and miss bennet , to dinner at pemberley , before they left the country . : 23.170089828311312
miss darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed . : 11.248636486827502
gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how _she_ , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head . : 9.090777871435234
presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on . : 11.764998250241204
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends . : 13.307139153430956
elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little . : 13.293255738031878
eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley , and then hurried away to dress . : 11.338252047557733
gardiner ' s curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication . : 15.400892168077554
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr . : 27.046840540432605
they saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry . : 23.76370988176257
darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find . : 15.028727875424908
they could not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant ' s report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have recognised it for mr . : 12.74529364754094
there was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected . : 12.795376060781123
neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight . : 14.927505085450951
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market - town , where the family did not visit . : 12.439775063449991
it was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor . : 18.13624529730044
with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which mr . : 11.212843002569649
darcy afterwards discharged . : 105.13406479796684
the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced . : 11.351975103138505
but above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked . : 12.755452063763006
she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses . : 12.597511542165286
they were , therefore , to go .-- elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply . : 20.231215300133087
gardiner left them soon after breakfast . : 37.18545731999966
the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon . : 14.060363435500959
on reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer . : 9.59801542298938
its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn . : 8.357371731113636
in this room they were received by miss darcy , who was sitting there with mrs . : 17.289783200167257
hurst and miss bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in london . : 16.417872400346138
gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her . : 23.233850029113345
by mrs . : 198.19634331570407
it was first broken by mrs . : 25.89499513864876
annesley , a genteel , agreeable - looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and mrs . : 9.84403615474467
gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on . : 19.570280496273188
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard . : 13.265867591437585
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention . : 13.332477476326424
this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much . : 13.626801728803123
her own thoughts were employing her . : 31.778720722227288
she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room . : 17.310713982311743
she wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine . : 16.04436460306625
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing miss bingley ' s voice , elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family . : 10.473907123821466
she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more . : 16.444389933589
annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post . : 22.21564017932255
while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr . : 11.177779956530552
darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came . : 17.02231631609634
he had been some time with mr . : 32.73515483218054
gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning . : 13.273527557002334
no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ;-- a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . : 10.343513796901613
in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley ' s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr . : 9.892320184244312
darcy were by no means over . : 34.259669102857714
miss darcy , on her brother ' s entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side . : 13.833285549767849
miss bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , " pray , miss eliza , are not the ---- shire militia removed from meryton ? : 13.248270795605674
they must be a great loss to _your_ family ." in darcy ' s presence she dared not mention wickham ' s name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ' s distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill - natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone . : 9.337314846988598
had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy ' s opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps . : 10.457625515136334
to no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to elizabeth ; and from all bingley ' s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own . : 11.250595597384363
he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend . : 13.156867539396375
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above - mentioned ; and while mr . : 12.495112424474698
darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth ' s person , behaviour , and dress . : 13.78470224538242
but georgiana would not join her . : 42.88191546127097
her brother ' s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable . : 10.294776625467044
when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister . : 16.086997663686976
" how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , mr . : 16.971304641470947
darcy ," she cried ; " i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter . : 17.397006649288247
she is grown so brown and coarse ! : 16.98059736274444
louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again ." however little mr . : 11.88114755525859
darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned ,-- no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer . : 9.769842248317845
" for my own part ," she rejoined , " i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her . : 16.967762168182087
her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . : 14.665987116646873
her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines . : 15.092893510144142
they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self - sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable ." persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected . : 10.60562583166424
he was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , " i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , ' _she_ a beauty !-- i should as soon call her mother a wit .' but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time ." " yes ," replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , " but _that_ was only when i first knew her , for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance ." he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself . : 9.84086101030194
gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both . : 13.311468630310246
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention . : 13.965902267999775
they talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of every thing but himself ; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs . : 18.902009267020755
gardiner thought of him , and mrs . : 37.99722713885003
chapter iv . : 107.29272991163054
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane , on their first arrival at lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere . : 11.99507816744655
elizabeth was not surprised at it , as jane had written the direction remarkably ill . : 16.966699141798436
the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence . : 10.055404703454666
what i have to say relates to poor lydia . : 24.251815367509863
an express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from colonel forster , to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with wickham !-- imagine our surprise . : 10.867706050581882
to kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . : 27.44071402671441
i am very , very sorry . : 41.11602251913824
so imprudent a match on both sides !-- but i am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . : 15.079952109290085
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart . : 8.114615015915527
his choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . : 19.774437563447453
my father bears it better . : 34.76214188863831
how thankful am i , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves . : 14.35576224856914
they were off saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . : 10.344019368534235
the express was sent off directly . : 30.98920473986296
my dear lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . : 17.524199410086027
colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . : 11.481643906994913
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but i hardly know what i have written ." without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , elizabeth on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first . : 10.194298363494777
" by this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; i wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent . : 13.273444921367338
dearest lizzy , i hardly know what i would write , but i have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed . : 17.665164845589178
wickham and our poor lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland . : 13.894413860436018
colonel forster came yesterday , having left brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . : 13.064836611828767
though lydia ' s short letter to mrs . : 24.97607589285957
f . : 280.4560503827073
gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green , something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w . : 7.5992464503547765
never intended to go there , or to marry lydia at all , which was repeated to colonel f . : 19.52405925770636
who instantly taking the alarm , set off from b . : 13.82435546598141
he did trace them easily to clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney - coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom . : 7.025766635487602
all that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the london road . : 15.99949585456544
i know not what to think . : 45.0825567747744
after making every possible enquiry on that side london , colonel f . : 14.534510325933383
came on into hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in barnet and hatfield , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through . : 10.061096116642947
i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs . : 24.447864169155046
but no one can throw any blame on them . : 14.646745195682707
our distress , my dear lizzy , is very great . : 29.452932761993427
my father and mother believe the worst , but i cannot think so ill of him . : 14.349136052097718
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of lydia ' s connections , which is not likely , can i suppose her so lost to every thing ?-- impossible . : 9.93180970565934
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when i expressed my hopes , and said he feared w . : 12.01306834305656
was not a man to be trusted . : 68.85291926431894
could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , i never in my life saw him so affected . : 18.37115917936345
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder . : 9.779596051893076
i am truly glad , dearest lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock is over , shall i own that i long for your return ? : 11.857740506049408
i am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient . : 21.736140174638184
adieu . : 627.0300670072188
i take up my pen again to do , what i have just told you i would not , but circumstances are such , that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible . : 13.31985885346305
my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly , to try to discover her . : 16.615514877089694
what he means to do , i am sure i know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to - morrow evening . : 12.068290362899118
where , where is my uncle ?" cried elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and mr . : 13.886561483932507
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia ' s situation , hastily exclaimed , " i beg your pardon , but i must leave you . : 10.090421289138519
i must find mr . : 72.12435318892965
gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ; i have not an instant to lose ." " good god ! : 15.163462697849678
what is the matter ?" cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , " i will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after mr . : 11.196057949754737
you are not well enough ;-- you cannot go yourself ." elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them . : 11.131725733362819
on his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , " let me call your maid . : 10.666371545484262
is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ?-- a glass of wine ;-- shall i get you one ?-- you are very ill ." " no , i thank you ;" she replied , endeavouring to recover herself . : 8.18133826485238
" there is nothing the matter with me . : 33.09327253084858
i am quite well . : 72.28060527017539
i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn ." she burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word . : 11.222282468925833
darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence . : 15.213140563994557
at length , she spoke again . : 50.3198613463562
it cannot be concealed from any one . : 38.275390803605774
my youngest sister has left all her friends -- has eloped ;-- has thrown herself into the power of -- of mr . : 8.710947804004016
_you_ know him too well to doubt the rest . : 18.809536884782645
she has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to -- she is lost for ever ." darcy was fixed in astonishment . : 13.696227084335753
" when i consider ," she added , in a yet more agitated voice , " that _i_ might have prevented it !-- _i_ who knew what he was . : 13.318387183096029
had i but explained some part of it only -- some part of what i learnt , to my own family ! : 17.409798131771275
had his character been known , this could not have happened . : 23.63642032103566
but it is all , all too late now ." " i am grieved , indeed ," cried darcy ; " grieved -- shocked . : 14.42366295305417
but is it certain , absolutely certain ?" " oh yes !-- they left brighton together on sunday night , and were traced almost to london , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to scotland ." " and what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ?" " my father is gone to london , and jane has written to beg my uncle ' s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , i hope , in half an hour . : 10.789937371583719
how are they even to be discovered ? : 40.4490184058676
it is every way horrible !" darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence . : 9.175199057713002
but i knew not -- i was afraid of doing too much . : 25.070543618938828
wretched , wretched , mistake !" darcy made no answer . : 8.224943715748632
he seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ; his brow contracted , his air gloomy . : 11.874277308858117
her power was sinking ; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace . : 11.785445827558194
she could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self - conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress . : 9.957045750109858
it was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain . : 13.624647623012434
but self , though it would intrude , could not engross her . : 23.883274048778937
this unfortunate affair will , i fear , prevent my sister ' s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to - day ." " oh , yes . : 12.942968407124953
be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy . : 21.947658316100007
as he quitted the room , elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire ; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination . : 7.9642862438144055
be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what lydia ' s infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business . : 11.304328050526633
never , since reading jane ' s second letter , had she entertained a hope of wickham ' s meaning to marry her . : 14.790791886030728
no one but jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation . : 24.08290609180021
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement . : 31.234302652320313
but now it was all too natural . : 40.66792699486732
for such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey . : 8.838104202238666
sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion . : 14.120399945781298
her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object . : 22.05883187132394
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl .-- oh ! : 12.57887533976548
how acutely did she now feel it . : 25.554438691791617
she was wild to be at home -- to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia , her uncle ' s interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe . : 12.274773097005776
gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant ' s account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ;-- but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy .-- though lydia had never been a favourite with them , mr . : 9.154056424974545
gardiner could not but be deeply affected . : 23.880715719421307
not lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , mr . : 14.98678590809408
gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power .-- elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled . : 8.411443128694215
they were to be off as soon as possible . : 27.797064357875787
" but what is to be done about pemberley ?" cried mrs . : 18.207702685489384
" john told us mr . : 34.25481367538918
darcy was here when you sent for us ;-- was it so ?" " yes ; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . : 12.30074956197812
_that_ is all settled ." " that is all settled ;" repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare . : 13.6948800660895
" and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth ! : 16.02010330831105
oh , that i knew how it was !" but wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour . : 10.186094379716184
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure . : 11.239074175925186
an hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and mr . : 21.00904600957897
gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to longbourn . : 13.345743546454548
" i have been thinking it over again , elizabeth ," said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; " and really , upon serious consideration , i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter . : 14.098783042391425
it appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel ' s family , that i am strongly inclined to hope the best . : 11.429736649176672
could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? : 26.96769453124266
could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to colonel forster ? : 19.208545452372746
his temptation is not adequate to the risk ." " do you really think so ?" cried elizabeth , brightening up for a moment . : 15.627991503783697
" upon my word ," said mrs . : 23.46839121982657
gardiner , " i begin to be of your uncle ' s opinion . : 27.41486102033047
it is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it . : 15.225044883809472
i cannot think so very ill of wickham . : 37.32916696185162
can you , yourself , lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ?" " not perhaps of neglecting his own interest . : 14.758315319790759
but of every other neglect i can believe him capable . : 26.762172575767483
if , indeed , it should be so ! : 63.20033887849783
but i dare not hope it . : 41.14539767221179
why should they not go on to scotland , if that had been the case ?" " in the first place ," replied mr . : 17.118558839511074
gardiner , " there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland ." " oh ! : 12.812405486127165
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption ! : 15.119663301655162
and , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road ." " well , then -- supposing them to be in london . : 15.952096205600899
they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose . : 22.351446633675284
it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in london , than in scotland ." " but why all this secrecy ? : 10.31887315224979
why any fear of detection ? : 27.593216964282696
why must their marriage be private ? : 20.716032343432328
no , no , this is not likely . : 49.42850471600081
his most particular friend , you see by jane ' s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her . : 19.241073481543875
wickham will never marry a woman without some money . : 20.997639997627356
he cannot afford it . : 64.65495000352203
and what claims has lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ? : 10.761935544255207
as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , i am not able to judge ; for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . : 11.202804620009859
but as to your other objection , i am afraid it will hardly hold good . : 20.257200024359687
lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father ' s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that _he_ would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter ." " but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ?" " it does seem , and it is most shocking indeed ," replied elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , " that a sister ' s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . : 12.3493191714185
but , really , i know not what to say . : 33.981725904536255
perhaps i am not doing her justice . : 25.461824811378232
but she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . : 13.248934412152177
since the ---- shire were first quartered in meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head . : 13.547238934033368
susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . : 13.634547956875835
and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman ." " but you see that jane ," said her aunt , " does not think so ill of wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt ." " of whom does jane ever think ill ? : 13.495586075847685
but jane knows , as well as i do , what wickham really is . : 20.28102137782182
we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word . : 25.06634699191574
that he has neither integrity nor honour . : 26.291591387781246
that he is as false and deceitful , as he is insinuating ." " and do you really know all this ?" cried mrs . : 13.460682770174925
gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive . : 19.810479156564273
" i do , indeed ," replied elizabeth , colouring . : 29.445220069037877
" i told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to mr . : 25.555278345872207
darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . : 12.663477989937082
and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty -- which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless . : 12.472586372328525
yet he knew to the contrary himself . : 37.81661809608351
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her ." " but does lydia know nothing of this ? : 15.576304176751595
can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand ?" " oh , yes !-- that , that is the worst of all . : 16.266644020968364
till i was in kent , and saw so much both of mr . : 26.59320843332661
darcy and his relation , colonel fitzwilliam , i was ignorant of the truth myself . : 25.81156789863917
as that was the case , neither jane , to whom i related the whole , nor i , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? : 12.20153047097661
and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs . : 19.847724857234237
forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . : 14.469527040797686
that _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . : 20.136523482880204
i can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away . : 12.52340027139614
when first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . : 16.19821926400935
every girl in , or near meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites ." * * * * * it may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey . : 9.791359938676047
from elizabeth ' s thoughts it was never absent . : 36.40635896969479
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness . : 9.813589447922906
they travelled as expeditiously as possible ; and sleeping one night on the road , reached longbourn by dinner - time the next day . : 9.603192310080503
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations . : 17.15796421422938
elizabeth jumped out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where jane , who came running down stairs from her mother ' s apartment , immediately met her . : 10.185439013975435
elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives . : 11.915614332869973
" not yet ," replied jane . : 58.366599323015095
" but now that my dear uncle is come , i hope every thing will be well ." " is my father in town ?" " yes , he went on tuesday as i wrote you word ." " and have you heard from him often ?" " we have heard only once . : 15.278130201399568
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which i particularly begged him to do . : 14.274331366179593
he merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention ." " and my mother -- how is she ? : 14.847784371151024
how are you all ?" " my mother is tolerably well , i trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . : 16.59404895521062
she is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all . : 25.06764926904831
she does not yet leave her dressing - room . : 24.174292560179527
" you look pale . : 75.93013219773736
how much you must have gone through !" her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while mr . : 16.459117995809375
gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party . : 15.755527572043945
when they were all in the drawing - room , the questions which elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give . : 14.42800411393812
the sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and perhaps announce the marriage . : 11.572814178566539
bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing . : 7.408008689516463
" if i had been able ," said she , " to carry my point of going to brighton , with all my family , _this_ would not have happened ; but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her . : 12.577605806709538
why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight ? : 13.913078701148736
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after . : 15.162351526483425
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but i was over - ruled , as i always am . : 18.322697735658355
and now here ' s mr . : 58.324435251116604
bennet gone away , and i know he will fight wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? : 15.105915008785793
gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in london the very next day , and would assist mr . : 15.417669900293022
bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia . : 22.941578011834462
" do not give way to useless alarm ," added he , " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . : 15.033953357018694
it is not quite a week since they left brighton . : 24.36540486842775
in a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost . : 13.368517563046792
as soon as i get to town , i shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to gracechurch street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done ." " oh ! : 14.10603725721054
my dear brother ," replied mrs . : 36.18631757021471
bennet , " that is exactly what i could most wish for . : 20.964994892839893
and as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married . : 16.116639043752354
bennet from fighting . : 92.2463467417771
tell him what a dreadful state i am in ,-- that i am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that i can get no rest by night nor by day . : 10.412563477029604
and tell my dear lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses . : 15.966424210902915
oh , brother , how kind you are ! : 31.036174741399186
i know you will contrive it all ." but mr . : 25.64091544759182
gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters . : 14.210487251983174
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that _one_ only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject . : 10.375152258197245
in the dining - room they were soon joined by mary and kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before . : 11.155379791450454
one came from her books , and the other from her toilette . : 28.57826015543391
the faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of kitty . : 11.957252743183188
as for mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , " this is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of . : 13.905688563760867
but we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other , the balm of sisterly consolation ." then , perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " unhappy as the event must be for lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable -- that one false step involves her in endless ruin -- that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful ,-- and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex ." elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply . : 8.019735938452746
mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them . : 11.970927157109859
in the afternoon , the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which jane was equally eager to satisfy . : 12.808069965764558
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which elizabeth considered as all but certain , and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , " but tell me all and every thing about it , which i have not already heard . : 13.460403114353248
give me farther particulars . : 51.43349479247295
had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ? : 19.52617332182053
they must have seen them together for ever ." " colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on lydia ' s side , but nothing to give him any alarm . : 12.509380833644084
i am so grieved for him . : 31.598394000367403
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost . : 33.6535154702023
he _was_ coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey ." " and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry ? : 11.577788125724869
did he know of their intending to go off ? : 29.58247310317348
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying -- and from _that_ , i am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before ." " and till colonel forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , i suppose , of their being really married ?" " how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains ! : 11.458822973697112
i felt a little uneasy -- a little fearful of my sister ' s happiness with him in marriage , because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right . : 16.276968989048825
my father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be . : 14.252258804390186
kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in lydia ' s last letter , she had prepared her for such a step . : 13.71811762982327
she had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks ." " but not before they went to brighton ?" " no , i believe not ." " and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself ? : 15.083643603784289
does he know his real character ?" " i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did . : 13.969052854426169
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant . : 35.01089008105
and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left meryton greatly in debt ; but i hope this may be false ." " oh , jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened !" " perhaps it would have been better ;" replied her sister . : 10.779962954703262
" but to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . : 13.274002133856655
we acted with the best intentions ." " could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia ' s note to his wife ?" " he brought it with him for us to see ." jane then took it from her pocket - book , and gave it to elizabeth . : 13.37149892979663
these were the contents : " my dear harriet , " you will laugh when you know where i am gone , and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to - morrow morning , as soon as i am missed . : 13.54061306619253
i am going to gretna green , and if you cannot guess with who , i shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world i love , and he is an angel . : 13.801221928874225
i should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off . : 24.314847265299257
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when i write to them , and sign my name lydia wickham . : 14.117042184050245
what a good joke it will be ! : 39.295253623955695
i can hardly write for laughing . : 32.4170822098285
pray make my excuses to pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to - night . : 12.565805360465943
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure . : 15.122903421523732
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn ; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up . : 10.64489306941296
good bye . : 303.0322335097161
give my love to colonel forster , i hope you will drink to our good journey . : 14.860643983663223
" your affectionate friend , " lydia bennet ." " oh ! : 23.575513242764057
thoughtless , thoughtless lydia !" cried elizabeth when she had finished it . : 12.543456843190773
" what a letter is this , to be written at such a moment . : 32.74140692129322
but at least it shews , that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey . : 22.958949769198778
my poor father ! : 125.37260712612519
how he must have felt it !" " i never saw any one so shocked . : 20.024157311403272
jane ," cried elizabeth , " was there a servant belonging to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ?" " i do not know .-- i hope there was .-- but to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult . : 15.258677151930812
my mother was in hysterics , and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done ! : 15.499766945036448
but the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my faculties ." " your attendance upon her , has been too much for you . : 11.707740516614983
you do not look well . : 60.131047347620125
that i had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone ." " mary and kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , i am sure , but i did not think it right for either of them . : 12.997211042157044
kitty is slight and delicate , and mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on . : 12.351065900978808
let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied ." she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter . : 12.207304365746616
" he meant , i believe ," replied jane , " to go to epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them . : 14.084200838643946
his principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham . : 16.50677802720616
it had come with a fare from london ; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady ' s removing from one carriage into another , might be remarked , he meant to make enquiries at clapham . : 11.595247525682009
if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach . : 9.397219687454704
bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him . : 13.166957967399632
his family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion . : 13.392443067730653
when he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on mr . : 13.784127401428748
bennet to return to longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband ' s not being killed in a duel . : 16.91607435494794
she shared in their attendance on mrs . : 27.084296601317668
bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom . : 25.240160877162765
their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up , though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham ' s extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them . : 8.642517228600573
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man , who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light . : 12.56033083090358
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman ' s family . : 11.798624420563312
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness . : 15.122573458891658
elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister ' s ruin still more certain ; and even jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them . : 10.370332284738904
gardiner left longbourn on sunday ; on tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street . : 13.367598612901602
that mr . : 164.04343770962407
bennet had been to epsom and clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town , as mr . : 12.439132334730363
bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to london , before they procured lodgings . : 16.946864350162418
gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it . : 12.916137927814415
he added , that mr . : 58.77902165542073
bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present , to leave london , and promised to write again very soon . : 16.758730428719968
" i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man ' s intimates in the regiment , whether wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself . : 13.152175092632639
if there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence . : 16.610575402954964
at present we have nothing to guide us . : 28.78069687349998
colonel forster will , i dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head . : 14.842215172389526
but , on second thoughts , perhaps lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person ." elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved . : 10.47426673764731
she had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years . : 15.585433612881301
through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance . : 10.982958561685804
but before they heard again from mr . : 23.629825859762086
gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from mr . : 19.377552042970418
collins ; which , as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . : 12.551468685789981
it was as follows : " my dear sir , " i feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire . : 10.87119897151583
be assured , my dear sir , that mrs . : 32.30917558005963
collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . : 12.25512083581105
no arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent ' s mind . : 10.481773821842822
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . : 20.124806397907534
and it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and mrs . : 12.772601110889706
bennet , i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age . : 13.302727137426308
howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs . : 13.920247768058065
collins , but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter , to whom i have related the affair . : 19.742070914147313
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others , for who , as lady catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family . : 11.966204849469444
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november , for had it been otherwise , i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . : 8.381923802899234
" i am , dear sir , & c . : 20.910484030711675
& c ." mr . : 21.90951889521482
gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from colonel forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send . : 18.66733013848608
it was not known that wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living . : 13.7850910655349
his former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them . : 15.893955616348268
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him . : 16.527591090076363
and in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia ' s relations , for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him , to a very considerable amount . : 12.311333291854076
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton . : 10.48201788435993
he owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable . : 19.90175059400851
" this is wholly unexpected . : 47.24779262325729
i had not an idea of it ." mr . : 35.446977459328664
gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was saturday . : 20.454194052993074
rendered spiritless by the ill - success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother - in - law ' s intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit . : 11.569256397395089
bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before . : 14.961795011293056
" what , is he coming home , and without poor lydia !" she cried . : 19.41903840507769
" sure he will not leave london before he has found them . : 24.668197140504827
who is to fight wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ?" as mrs . : 15.505652783728385
gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to london , at the same time that mr . : 15.422835813709552
bennet came from it . : 77.0242718205706
the coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to longbourn . : 15.224097915904
gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world . : 16.7599354361544
the present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from _that_ , though elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of darcy , she could have borne the dread of lydia ' s infamy somewhat better . : 11.900064494606122
bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure . : 24.330806522727173
he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it . : 13.794757550580472
who should suffer but myself ? : 36.87519090395998
" you may well warn me against such an evil . : 20.797073183940295
human nature is so prone to fall into it ! : 12.320400787933657
no , lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame . : 16.958525965809354
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . : 24.213111475191273
it will pass away soon enough ." " do you suppose them to be in london ?" " yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ?" " and lydia used to want to go to london ," added kitty . : 12.681908766938717
no , kitty , i have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it . : 23.354825591296873
balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters . : 12.755520234221772
and you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner ." kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry . : 11.65853443844067
if you are a good girl for the next ten years , i will take you to a review at the end of them ." chapter vii . : 16.125994021045365
two days after mr . : 41.67416442185387
hill , in great astonishment , " don ' t you know there is an express come for master from mr . : 12.125668533281434
gardiner ? : 2406.367478287054
he has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter ." away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech . : 11.536975025850676
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from thence to the library ;-- their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said , " if you are looking for my master , ma ' am , he is walking towards the little copse ." upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock . : 9.355086961657713
jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , " oh , papa , what news ? : 11.169051152882988
what news ? : 324.9567051544025
have you heard from my uncle ?" " yes , i have had a letter from him by express ." " well , and what news does it bring ? : 16.00158305965511
good or bad ?" " what is there of good to be expected ?" said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; " but perhaps you would like to read it ." elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand . : 13.075133956969648
jane now came up . : 59.96883622209426
" read it aloud ," said their father , " for i hardly know myself what it is about ." " gracechurch - street , monday , august <NUM> . : 23.847095473345984
soon after you left me on saturday , i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were . : 16.21586876247573
the particulars , i reserve till we meet . : 38.41101622255271
these are conditions , which , considering every thing , i had no hesitation in complying with , as far as i thought myself privileged , for you . : 14.57393609423122
i shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer . : 11.258514183321275
you will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that mr . : 20.654784616453334
wickham ' s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be . : 18.57433219996205
the world has been deceived in that respect ; and i am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune . : 14.914412023328957
if , as i conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement . : 9.51590255593162
we have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which i hope you will approve . : 17.7464504792055
she comes to us to - day . : 44.89178619885758
your ' s , & c . : 29.45421982697659
" can it be possible that he will marry her ?" " wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ;" said her sister . : 16.799324635213484
" my dear father , i congratulate you ." " and have you answered the letter ?" said elizabeth . : 18.89359447339293
" no ; but it must be done soon ." most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote . : 14.56079902032058
my dear father ," she cried , " come back , and write immediately . : 21.710499594744494
consider how important every moment is , in such a case ." " let me write for you ," said jane , " if you dislike the trouble yourself ." " i dislike it very much ," he replied ; " but it must be done ." and so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house . : 12.486626363777269
" and may i ask ?" said elizabeth , " but the terms , i suppose , must be complied with ." " complied with ! : 18.063622091703113
i am only ashamed of his asking so little ." " and they _must_ marry ! : 20.334335547704516
yet he is _such_ a man !" " yes , yes , they must marry . : 21.622504822055145
there is nothing else to be done . : 42.10096223532148
but there are two things that i want very much to know :-- one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ; and the other , how i am ever to pay him ." " money ! : 14.781090786248924
my uncle !" cried jane , " what do you mean , sir ?" " i mean , that no man in his senses , would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a - year during my life , and fifty after i am gone ." " that is very true ," said elizabeth ; " though it had not occurred to me before . : 11.743882048650315
his debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! : 31.67054891179831
it must be my uncle ' s doings ! : 42.320805146208336
generous , good man , i am afraid he has distressed himself . : 17.063109339360647
a small sum could not do all this ." " no ," said her father , " wickham ' s a fool , if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds . : 13.986088085006605
heaven forbid ! : 104.58024422913432
bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house . : 12.08510334902672
their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast - room . : 15.747682312980704
" and they are really to be married !" cried elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves . : 21.83310894190978
" how strange this is ! : 67.2522441786891
and for _this_ we are to be thankful . : 43.20265907218671
that they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! : 13.380795410720559
oh , lydia !" " i comfort myself with thinking ," replied jane , " that he certainly would not marry lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . : 15.311815582933953
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced . : 12.16387075951623
he has children of his own , and may have more . : 35.4582835194002
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds ?" " if we are ever able to learn what wickham ' s debts have been ," said elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what mr . : 10.760980225952412
gardiner has done for them , because wickham has not sixpence of his own . : 24.360526130320878
by this time she is actually with them ! : 35.51916422414342
if such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! : 23.432319833639852
what a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt !" " we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side ," said jane : " i hope and trust they will yet be happy . : 11.152763097248485
his consenting to marry her is a proof , i will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking . : 17.998623362307985
their mutual affection will steady them ; and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten ." " their conduct has been such ," replied elizabeth , " as neither you , nor i , nor any body , can ever forget . : 9.76274213213928
it is useless to talk of it ." it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened . : 15.231700790500195
they went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her . : 19.025457666442982
he was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " just as you please ." " may we take my uncle ' s letter to read to her ?" " take whatever you like , and get away ." elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together . : 13.190561277342342
mary and kitty were both with mrs . : 17.57622204265333
bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all . : 20.94130885988873
after a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud . : 17.090176777952095
as soon as jane had read mr . : 28.23183415374474
gardiner ' s hope of lydia ' s being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance . : 12.22520463505159
to know that her daughter would be married was enough . : 39.921303443982914
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct . : 15.611665790815374
" my dear , dear lydia !" she cried : " this is delightful indeed !-- she will be married !-- i shall see her again !-- she will be married at sixteen !-- my good , kind brother !-- i knew how it would be -- i knew he would manage every thing . : 9.84869548517215
how i long to see her ! : 36.8644990868512
and to see dear wickham too ! : 59.64236682959637
but the clothes , the wedding clothes ! : 45.8228915604031
i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly . : 24.45966348891832
lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . : 18.618798426306654
stay , stay , i will go myself . : 28.637744095668623
ring the bell , kitty , for hill . : 18.31232159594341
i will put on my things in a moment . : 27.828153992302873
my dear , dear lydia !-- how merry we shall be together when we meet !" her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr . : 8.425847827149456
gardiner ' s behaviour laid them all under . : 20.67328635155039
" for we must attribute this happy conclusion ," she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness . : 17.07978534920819
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr . : 17.777651156930943
wickham with money ." " well ," cried her mother , " it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ? : 12.57993032200285
if he had not had a family of his own , i and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents . : 17.485552254851562
well ! : 3666.579598364194
i am so happy . : 68.9104900789898
in a short time , i shall have a daughter married . : 35.490265593006214
wickham ! : 2501.493559459489
and she was only sixteen last june . : 28.72595820324883
my dear jane , i am in such a flutter , that i am sure i can ' t write ; so i will dictate , and you write for me . : 15.03224485120799
we will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately ." she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted . : 10.186811473409055
one day ' s delay she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual . : 16.296120272240728
other schemes too came into her head . : 25.6847675275389
" i will go to meryton ," said she , " as soon as i am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister philips . : 16.479673591876992
and as i come back , i can call on lady lucas and mrs . : 24.268518977605535
kitty , run down and order the carriage . : 14.856432830276141
an airing would do me a great deal of good , i am sure . : 16.833324362568998
girls , can i do any thing for you in meryton ? : 36.48151847383804
here comes hill . : 69.66703273673741
my dear hill , have you heard the good news ? : 21.51830642069513
miss lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch , to make merry at her wedding ." mrs . : 12.52472697977365
hill began instantly to express her joy . : 16.700545391560297
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom . : 12.380702107552318
she felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ; in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained . : 10.883744419746408
bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him . : 12.526252044579838
he now wished it more than ever . : 40.77027094042875
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband , might then have rested in its proper place . : 10.112507904491292
he was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother - in - law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could . : 13.28552257304254
when first mr . : 94.40156531057949
bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son . : 16.122782128098542
this son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for . : 9.621574119657398
bennet , for many years after lydia ' s birth , had been certain that he would . : 23.124947208497076
this event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving . : 17.994251061715993
bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband ' s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income . : 9.839290089314492
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs . : 10.691027535034534
bennet and the children . : 140.69031235634318
bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him . : 19.140275414901687
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him . : 10.165383077355497
he would scarcely be ten pounds a - year the loser , by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother ' s hands , lydia ' s expences had been very little within that sum . : 10.083654227770323
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible . : 14.334781293223408
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence . : 10.453710429417498
he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with lydia , to send any message to her . : 18.00084884417662
the good news quickly spread through the house ; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood . : 17.255317686512456
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy . : 24.718457608580565
but there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good - natured wishes for her well - doing , which had proceeded before , from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain . : 13.611339683464664
bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high . : 17.332378097480447
the marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants . : 12.39557306835664
" haye - park might do ," said she , " if the gouldings would quit it , or the great house at stoke , if the drawing - room were larger ; but ashworth is too far off ! : 8.755599563609861
i could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for purvis lodge , the attics are dreadful ." her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained . : 11.38152164992282
but when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " mrs . : 31.318284085649307
bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding . : 15.284942545772543
into _one_ house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance . : 20.48778702742079
bennet was firm : it soon led to another ; and mrs . : 15.018678049004698
bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter . : 13.91964613223116
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion . : 14.804899797036617
bennet could hardly comprehend it . : 42.65949800825666
that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible . : 9.628730022367833
she was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham , a fortnight before they took place . : 11.803803856228624
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make mr . : 18.09762556178082
she had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means . : 17.335691191578945
there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister ' s frailty would have mortified her so much . : 12.749051568862509
not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , individually to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them . : 12.079205081217927
had lydia ' s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that mr . : 15.678245540279079
darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned . : 11.640367179278904
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink . : 25.87935072014596
the wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this . : 13.574643281003274
she was humbled , she was grieved ; she repented , though she hardly knew of what . : 18.075483283913304
she became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it . : 19.507751387859773
she wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence . : 22.21309822874829
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they should meet . : 20.376991680904077
he was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex . : 26.29061046086083
but while he was mortal , there must be a triumph . : 29.470922302532774
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her . : 14.77219731135932
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance . : 13.995598757199875
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was . : 7.227622107614095
an union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family . : 20.78422842354293
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine . : 18.412609985780833
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture . : 7.858106300768643
* * * * * mr . : 12.146309500033896
gardiner soon wrote again to his brother . : 29.358897109319898
bennet ' s acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again . : 13.37112852132307
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that mr . : 24.696028933053295
wickham had resolved on quitting the militia . : 22.46556696657334
wickham ' s intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . : 10.978351331072838
he has the promise of an ensigncy in general ----' s regiment , now quartered in the north . : 13.79245204430181
he promises fairly , and i hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . : 11.656839678169918
i have written to colonel forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr . : 11.988967187610713
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton , of whom i shall subjoin a list , according to his information . : 10.37303197056468
he has given in all his debts ; i hope at least he has not deceived us . : 17.542398096646373
haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week . : 17.778337754135567
they will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to longbourn ; and i understand from mrs . : 13.331183011986038
gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the south . : 15.140548883873775
she is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother .-- your ' s , & c . : 17.884510755622966
" e . : 535.0872078112053
bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham ' s removal from the ---- shire , as clearly as mr . : 14.465317296039975
gardiner could do . : 96.78901122002218
bennet , was not so well pleased with it . : 43.11875290699854
lydia ' s being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites . : 11.807209432640681
" she is so fond of mrs . : 37.040251424632906
forster ," said she , " it will be quite shocking to send her away ! : 14.043268010070628
the officers may not be so pleasant in general ----' s regiment ." his daughter ' s request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the north , received at first an absolute negative . : 12.439627622527508
but jane and elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ' s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . : 12.02739707374511
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the north . : 16.21066982538974
bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to longbourn . : 15.148851203483686
elizabeth was surprised , however , that wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes . : 16.321707934121495
the carriage was sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return in it , by dinner - time . : 16.40783446739897
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets ; and jane more especially , who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had _she_ been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure . : 12.599275844696681
the family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them . : 34.34814020348661
smiles decked the face of mrs . : 12.481133125938753
her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness . : 10.276216552265723
their reception from mr . : 45.93258036994844
bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial . : 19.688600452441744
his countenance rather gained in austerity ; and he scarcely opened his lips . : 14.244323118088499
the easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him . : 24.382343849432505
elizabeth was disgusted , and even miss bennet was shocked . : 30.807490591763614
lydia was lydia still ; untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless . : 8.615408586878704
she turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there . : 11.766001993104739
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all . : 12.578901063139703
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man . : 11.310879589987268
_she_ blushed , and jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour . : 10.153668243984924
there was no want of discourse . : 33.64511093860005
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and wickham , who happened to sit near elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies . : 12.9690624930394
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world . : 21.69121494124843
nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world . : 13.93731032070812
when i went away , i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again ! : 16.06695394849382
jane was distressed . : 101.21370289661867
mamma , do the people here abouts know i am married to - day ? : 13.542320632826184
i was afraid they might not ; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle , so i was determined he should know it , and so i let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then i bowed and smiled like any thing ." elizabeth could bear it no longer . : 10.094220807950938
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother ' s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , " ah ! : 15.597856849020996
jane , i take your place now , and you must go lower , because i am a married woman ." it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first . : 11.337946744329827
her ease and good spirits increased . : 44.939356237888205
she longed to see mrs . : 65.24008277420272
hill and the two housemaids . : 44.35015009598395
" well , mamma ," said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , " and what do you think of my husband ? : 17.838052937509197
is not he a charming man ? : 31.684254052402526
i am sure my sisters must all envy me . : 12.854189893775757
i only hope they may have half my good luck . : 19.117941064290488
they must all go to brighton . : 35.77777520925106
what a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go ." " very true ; and if i had my will , we should . : 19.071967335122217
but my dear lydia , i don ' t at all like your going such a way off . : 20.70524037171007
yes ;-- there is nothing in that . : 37.37462039812767
i shall like it of all things . : 45.536727814968316
we shall be at newcastle all the winter , and i dare say there will be some balls , and i will take care to get good partners for them all ." " i should like it beyond any thing !" said her mother . : 11.639127736719418
wickham had received his commission before he left london , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight . : 15.782454049587246
no one but mrs . : 55.46488106791873
bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home . : 15.42944658741038
these parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not . : 11.073051156163917
wickham ' s affection for lydia , was just what elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to lydia ' s for him . : 16.12079395028132
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion . : 11.717730293339194
lydia was exceedingly fond of him . : 35.38316825137326
he was her dear wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him . : 15.167351189822414
he did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september , than any body else in the country . : 12.975266743088106
one morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to elizabeth , " lizzy , i never gave _you_ an account of my wedding , i believe . : 16.4197367800068
you were not by , when i told mamma , and the others , all about it . : 24.696491809674132
are not you curious to hear how it was managed ?" " no really ," replied elizabeth ; " i think there cannot be too little said on the subject ." " la ! : 13.563375961156483
you are so strange ! : 80.37541840870931
but i must tell you how it went off . : 23.243083609297504
we were married , you know , at st . : 31.7923293497878
clement ' s , because wickham ' s lodgings were in that parish . : 18.199638519818997
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o ' clock . : 11.555936912503316
my uncle and aunt and i were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church . : 21.178897287298003
well , monday morning came , and i was in such a fuss ! : 22.50117905956436
i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then i should have gone quite distracted . : 14.189649322172185
and there was my aunt , all the time i was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . : 16.147750801126783
" well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ; i thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them . : 12.300050719931312
not one party , or scheme , or any thing . : 37.41929955278666
to be sure london was rather thin , but however the little theatre was open . : 14.828087014881609
well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr . : 14.160952977667126
stone . : 396.61071899991884
well , i was so frightened i did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day . : 17.41217924888968
but , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out . : 16.58873663812659
however , i recollected afterwards , that if he _had_ been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for mr . : 15.536590589955553
darcy might have done as well ." " mr . : 28.638438697012184
darcy !" repeated elizabeth , in utter amazement . : 34.81539969058326
but gracious me ! : 135.74181069817342
i quite forgot ! : 159.84648906111198
i ought not to have said a word about it . : 29.94418814981497
i promised them so faithfully ! : 44.35707557979121
what will wickham say ? : 54.32608791641195
it was to be such a secret !" " if it was to be secret ," said jane , " say not another word on the subject . : 17.909198828068885
you may depend upon my seeking no further ." " oh ! : 13.18011903206584
certainly ," said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions ." " thank you ," said lydia , " for if you did , i should certainly tell you all , and then wickham would be angry ." on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away . : 12.165674145274089
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information . : 13.298824872995477
darcy had been at her sister ' s wedding . : 36.20336283091297
it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go . : 16.18533681457246
conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none . : 12.193031808171323
those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable . : 12.887937425589827
she could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended . : 9.52059810454695
" you may readily comprehend ," she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . : 11.643758083639835
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could . : 19.183690340099748
she was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial . : 15.904339315175287
" gracechurch - street , sept . : 28.796935951251953
" my dear niece , " i have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as i foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise what i have to tell you . : 11.151434499518853
i must confess myself surprised by your application ; i did not expect it from _you_ . : 15.62363299454123
don ' t think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know , that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_ side . : 10.17525709380975
if you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . : 16.411337684157033
your uncle is as much surprised as i am -- and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done . : 16.97477128352158
but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit . : 22.878003995637695
on the very day of my coming home from longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . : 17.182338335517603
it was all over before i arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _your ' s_ seems to have been . : 9.677515599324371
he came to tell mr . : 58.43404874630808
gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr . : 18.908348898767503
the motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham ' s worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him . : 12.278249671374097
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world . : 13.80544961838114
his character was to speak for itself . : 46.33044727998948
he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself . : 15.989425777588169
if he _had another_ motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him . : 14.158956695896268
he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than _we_ had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us . : 13.252102307842986
there is a lady , it seems , a mrs . : 32.90151126799607
younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . : 11.052583536663281
she then took a large house in edward - street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . : 10.289305627793139
younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . : 16.27843378668768
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . : 19.901873343596023
she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . : 12.31112930723774
wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . : 14.379819260694061
at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished - for direction . : 9.343424608718637
they were in ---- street . : 37.66106788809877
his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go . : 15.821543452796352
since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt , had never been _his_ design . : 14.456556447212169
he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill - consequences of lydia ' s flight , on her own folly alone . : 12.494721970665955
he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . : 14.573065100967042
he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . : 21.129432991538067
though mr . : 275.22731118399327
bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . : 17.177351716009717
but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country . : 13.198771793014625
under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . : 12.709795092478336
they met several times , for there was much to be discussed . : 27.315377102341827
wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . : 18.82957012172194
every thing being settled between _them_ , mr . : 15.666689236692632
darcy ' s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch - street the evening before i came home . : 13.10819458734184
darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . : 17.4334290922439
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former . : 15.307959257622887
he did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . : 17.23662112940415
on saturday he came again . : 48.74832276498693
your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they had a great deal of talk together . : 17.978548790973896
they met again on sunday , and then _i_ saw him too . : 21.930292006803484
it was not all settled before monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn . : 13.76210708932982
but our visitor was very obstinate . : 38.50395655677833
i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all . : 23.546936287091725
he has been accused of many faults at different times ; but _this_ is the true one . : 12.310442427951413
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though i am sure ( and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it ,) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . : 12.310249095192678
but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due . : 10.5418408715681
but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most . : 16.430247451371173
you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people . : 23.596165476122724
his debts are to be paid , amounting , i believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_ , and his commission purchased . : 12.188670683077472
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above . : 23.719714038377585
it was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that wickham ' s character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . : 16.390964233341823
perhaps there was some truth in _this_ ; though i doubt whether _his_ reserve , or _anybody ' s_ reserve , can be answerable for the event . : 11.42951065329904
when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish . : 14.489218496323858
i believe i have now told you every thing . : 31.169282208885814
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . : 13.535114277213655
lydia came to us ; and wickham had constant admission to the house . : 25.632875757056294
_he_ was exactly what he had been , when i knew him in hertfordshire ; but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with _her_ behaviour while she staid with us , if i had not perceived , by jane ' s letter last wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what i now tell you , can give you no fresh pain . : 11.589626945073558
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . : 18.89018489324291
i was sometimes quite provoked , but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . : 14.182554154546144
darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding . : 21.824479033876482
he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday . : 16.429169966137444
will you be very angry with me , my dear lizzy , if i take this opportunity of saying ( what i was never bold enough to say before ) how much i like him . : 11.727918661822429
his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire . : 15.394980062317865
his understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and _that_ , if he marry _prudently_ , his wife may teach him . : 12.13481529593709
i thought him very sly ;-- he hardly ever mentioned your name . : 13.678390880262267
but slyness seems the fashion . : 32.04123378122364
i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park . : 21.32637697350188
a low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing . : 14.97429833768668
but i must write no more . : 47.328399061930895
your ' s , very sincerely , " m . : 35.465880210135595
gardiner ." the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share . : 10.129732361865628
darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! : 11.291995235914756
he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce . : 10.461638654748826
her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her . : 24.990216792834488
but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham . : 10.190683024421453
brother - in - law of wickham ! : 21.190903299193938
every kind of pride must revolt from the connection . : 24.31386883277416
he had to be sure done much . : 40.1148064083617
but he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief . : 13.824301905644111
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned . : 11.947001644260501
it was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return . : 16.060411914975692
they owed the restoration of lydia , her character , every thing to him . : 23.831144851201877
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him . : 9.426574644478118
for herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him . : 26.20108693772551
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself . : 15.665906027195765
she read over her aunt ' s commendation of him again and again . : 24.277129210972166
it was hardly enough ; but it pleased her . : 28.256231725159054
she was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one ' s approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by wickham . : 15.177399986284923
" i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ?" said he , as he joined her . : 10.69946568412516
" you certainly do ," she replied with a smile ; " but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome ." " i should be sorry indeed , if it were . : 14.99167495664657
_we_ were always good friends ; and now we are better ." " true . : 17.23534211294002
are the others coming out ?" " i do not know . : 22.562072815079873
bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton . : 31.03616728524576
" i almost envy you the pleasure , and yet i believe it would be too much for me , or else i could take it in my way to newcastle . : 17.69032226293608
and you saw the old housekeeper , i suppose ? : 38.11631314574693
poor reynolds , she was always very fond of me . : 25.71599141033377
but of course she did not mention my name to you ." " yes , she did ." " and what did she say ?" " that you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had -- not turned out well . : 13.357428749432847
at such a distance as _that_ , you know , things are strangely misrepresented ." " certainly ," he replied , biting his lips . : 10.720827147454932
i wonder what he can be doing there ." " perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh ," said elizabeth . : 15.076372090423547
" it must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year ." " undoubtedly . : 18.697134585816535
i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had ." " yes ; he introduced us to his sister ." " and do you like her ?" " very much ." " i have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two . : 13.81312821765961
when i last saw her , she was not very promising . : 27.653854313198632
i am very glad you liked her . : 25.723815524729286
i hope she will turn out well ." " i dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age ." " did you go by the village of kympton ?" " i do not recollect that we did ." " i mention it , because it is the living which i ought to have had . : 12.497064579284334
a most delightful place !-- excellent parsonage house ! : 15.492400880110146
i should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing . : 20.208001096501665
one ought not to repine ;-- but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! : 22.2213457008907
the quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! : 21.831051411628827
but it was not to be . : 58.60518136832931
yes , there was something in _that_ ; i told you so from the first , you may remember ." " i _did_ hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon - making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly ." " you did ! : 12.65111764918291
you may remember what i told you on that point , when first we talked of it ." they were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister ' s sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good - humoured smile , " come , mr . : 13.499161936791012
wickham , we are brother and sister , you know . : 31.57455561882869
do not let us quarrel about the past . : 26.41609325958645
in future , i hope we shall be always of one mind ." she held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house . : 12.118883504323826
wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet . : 13.822867944694028
the day of his and lydia ' s departure soon came , and mrs . : 22.4666282681153
bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth . : 12.398768880926909
i don ' t know . : 45.29901668544712
not these two or three years perhaps ." " write to me very often , my dear ." " as often as i can . : 21.243880703034556
but you know married women have never much time for writing . : 17.445842847614546
wickham ' s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife ' s . : 15.502426802286845
he smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things . : 24.18271309796391
bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , " as ever i saw . : 20.893418310764936
he simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all . : 31.749403983363113
i am prodigiously proud of him . : 31.084607729258575
i defy even sir william lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son - in - law ." the loss of her daughter made mrs . : 12.025481115037403
bennet very dull for several days . : 22.257624371817656
" i often think ," said she , " that there is nothing so bad as parting with one ' s friends . : 13.690940738842812
one seems so forlorn without them ." " this is the consequence you see , madam , of marrying a daughter ," said elizabeth . : 11.595718251799056
" it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single ." " it is no such thing . : 14.457727846142514
lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband ' s regiment happens to be so far off . : 16.02273696513645
if that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon ." but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation . : 13.008442813823217
she looked at jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns . : 22.89277013159401
bingley is coming down , sister ," ( for mrs . : 16.50179544944181
not that i care about it , though . : 63.27368182525051
he is nothing to us , you know , and i am sure _i_ never want to see him again . : 18.527657071898794
but , however , he is very welcome to come to netherfield , if he likes it . : 21.233621151373296
and who knows what _may_ happen ? : 27.972189514190887
but that is nothing to us . : 62.6829534519713
you know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it . : 17.13755702148329
and so , is it quite certain he is coming ?" " you may depend on it ," replied the other , " for mrs . : 19.871862864889234
nicholls was in meryton last night ; i saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true . : 12.455739766360658
he comes down on thursday at the latest , very likely on wednesday . : 15.755728251623479
she was going to the butcher ' s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks , just fit to be killed ." miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour . : 12.55213775405215
but don ' t imagine it was from any silly cause . : 20.35626134315842
i was only confused for the moment , because i felt that i _should_ be looked at . : 22.557785267863288
i am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . : 15.315664584095884
not that i am afraid of _myself_ , but i dread other people ' s remarks ." elizabeth did not know what to make of it . : 15.273109184491327
had she not seen him in derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend ' s permission , or being bold enough to come without it . : 12.660871045553227
" yet it is hard ," she sometimes thought , " that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation ! : 13.545715312682661
i _will_ leave him to himself ." in spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it . : 16.668756409513524
they were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them . : 15.30267786430956
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again . : 12.33643042768743
" as soon as ever mr . : 41.40616298740522
bingley comes , my dear ," said mrs . : 21.329483744339242
bennet , " you will wait on him of course ." " no , no . : 24.61878543146965
you forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if i went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . : 17.833247634885062
but it ended in nothing , and i will not be sent on a fool ' s errand again ." his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to netherfield . : 11.900221320489328
"' tis an etiquette i despise ," said he . : 8.962308746697161
he knows where we live . : 53.879936722751225
i will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again ." " well , all i know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him . : 11.043540896817392
but , however , that shan ' t prevent my asking him to dine here , i am determined . : 15.721864054500589
we must have mrs . : 67.98515019102327
long and the gouldings soon . : 57.439816344022226
that will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him ." consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ' s incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr . : 10.514300586642367
bingley in consequence of it , before _they_ did . : 31.9287623302973
as the day of his arrival drew near , " i begin to be sorry that he comes at all ," said jane to her sister . : 21.83061443621373
my mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much i suffer from what she says . : 17.259845027899267
happy shall i be , when his stay at netherfield is over !" " i wish i could say any thing to comfort you ," replied elizabeth ; " but it is wholly out of my power . : 14.228229717946174
you must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much ." mr . : 14.243194286042904
bingley arrived . : 359.51503489225485
bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could . : 11.328806716872666
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before . : 9.679792733369942
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing - room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house . : 13.160111537057254
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy . : 16.723657067579943
jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window -- she looked ,-- she saw mr . : 14.584237885439611
darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister . : 32.65235749928536
" there is a gentleman with him , mamma ," said kitty ; " who can it be ?" " some acquaintance or other , my dear , i suppose ; i am sure i do not know ." " la !" replied kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . : 12.372987518951778
what ' s his name . : 88.49812528228377
darcy !-- and so it does i vow . : 27.284618040038115
well , any friend of mr . : 26.154580944174857
bingley ' s will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him ." jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern . : 13.414521152684877
each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of mr . : 19.08741484096241
darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr . : 24.574375192281472
bingley ' s friend , without being heard by either of them . : 20.47481981366967
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs . : 11.881928411526927
gardiner ' s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him . : 16.67225463204879
to jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what jane felt for bingley . : 13.319043151434347
her astonishment at his coming -- at his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire . : 13.537997509013842
the colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken . : 10.616983239202042
but she would not be secure . : 57.75039686732949
" let me first see how he behaves ," said she ; " it will then be early enough for expectation ." she sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door . : 10.059005519123843
jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than elizabeth had expected . : 15.313603529414562
on the gentlemen ' s appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance . : 10.357766950228775
she had ventured only one glance at darcy . : 23.66791466494371
he looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at pemberley . : 16.385404931556195
it was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture . : 20.685571514835946
he was received by mrs . : 45.56845994005846
bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend . : 12.629837983742148
elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied . : 10.640039507022756
darcy , after enquiring of her how mr . : 33.907350929884544
gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing . : 17.299056383364555
he was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in derbyshire . : 20.172611232090674
there he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself . : 38.83903435456951
but now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground . : 10.489480541221276
more thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed . : 16.58882308163178
she was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so . : 26.015147463046855
" could i expect it to be otherwise !" said she . : 26.633452439263195
" yet why did he come ?" she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak . : 15.556523720040012
she enquired after his sister , but could do no more . : 33.19252101174573
" it is a long time , mr . : 31.517973029125635
bingley , since you went away ," said mrs . : 21.658180349515547
he readily agreed to it . : 54.237946302336816
people _did_ say , you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas ; but , however , i hope it is not true . : 14.336363735080354
miss lucas is married and settled . : 22.14269648614127
and one of my own daughters . : 90.13996766287674
i suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers . : 25.432245472151322
it was in the times and the courier , i know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . : 21.465450653125874
it was only said , ' lately , george wickham , esq . : 18.038615705180085
it was my brother gardiner ' s drawing up too , and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . : 16.42331085590407
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes . : 25.364401280606632
how mr . : 194.0569766318965
darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell . : 29.292781449182755
" it is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married ," continued her mother , " but at the same time , mr . : 15.093661262638555
bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me . : 18.736589139359292
his regiment is there ; for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the ---- shire , and of his being gone into the regulars . : 18.00152600929779
he has _some_ friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves ." elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at mr . : 16.494928903107812
darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat . : 19.94351848998988
it drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present . : 14.837329390475363
a few weeks , he believed . : 58.02663257943927
" when you have killed all your own birds , mr . : 18.08068544268098
bingley ," said her mother , " i beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on mr . : 14.925838457211087
i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you ." elizabeth ' s misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention ! : 12.455189253291081
at that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion . : 13.152054924101883
" the first wish of my heart ," said she to herself , " is never more to be in company with either of them . : 20.681414634575585
their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! : 17.30658333988242
let me never see either one or the other again !" yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re - kindled the admiration of her former lover . : 8.596814755832066
when first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . : 19.297496486855216
he found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty . : 15.883717843932327
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever . : 18.346217775393264
but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . : 20.957376054465804
when the gentlemen rose to go away , mrs . : 23.458274505878947
" you are quite a visit in my debt , mr . : 18.903607849412374
bingley ," she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned . : 14.024486801677135
bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a - year . : 10.859293843330464
as soon as they were gone , elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more . : 9.188537316535626
darcy ' s behaviour astonished and vexed her . : 17.776863245509606
" why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent ," said she , " did he come at all ?" she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . : 14.44826338782519
" he could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? : 22.370288539261868
if he fears me , why come hither ? : 22.682446189417064
if he no longer cares for me , why silent ? : 21.77229424175524
teazing , teazing , man ! : 16.921335391801904
i will think no more about him ." her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than elizabeth . : 13.523587096238076
" now ," said she , " that this first meeting is over , i feel perfectly easy . : 14.480544603026338
i am glad he dines here on tuesday . : 16.24914717191871
it will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance ." " yes , very indifferent indeed ," said elizabeth , laughingly . : 10.237468084238795
" oh , jane , take care ." " my dear lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now ." " i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever ." * * * * * they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday ; and mrs . : 10.86367538420103
bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of bingley , in half an hour ' s visit , had revived . : 16.220327920010938
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn ; and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time . : 12.906345330106126
her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself . : 13.893551711256325
on entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided . : 17.32422412095863
he placed himself by her . : 57.81900212611781
darcy , with an expression of half - laughing alarm . : 19.086228128626892
his behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , jane ' s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured . : 13.638701221531988
though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour . : 15.136327643114514
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour . : 16.976016684725053
darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them . : 22.21475664850276
he was on one side of her mother . : 41.781003168782405
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage . : 15.48667152712967
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did . : 12.69225952262591
her mother ' s ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth ' s mind ; and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family . : 12.761130484732314
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance . : 10.974224001779557
anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing - room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil . : 13.136870538391808
she looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend . : 18.750236646598907
" if he does not come to me , _then_ ," said she , " i shall give him up for ever ." the gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas ! : 13.419129181758315
the ladies had crowded round the table , where miss bennet was making tea , and elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her , which would admit of a chair . : 11.981852207115248
and on the gentlemen ' s approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " the men shan ' t come and part us , i am determined . : 14.647966641384938
we want none of them ; do we ?" darcy had walked away to another part of the room . : 13.598353512298587
she followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly ! : 10.941539005906142
" a man who has once been refused ! : 24.627979721478553
is there one among the sex , who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? : 15.4264867414651
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings !" she was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying , " is your sister at pemberley still ?" " yes , she will remain there till christmas ." " and quite alone ? : 9.248561263826684
have all her friends left her ?" " mrs . : 31.949568677994797
annesley is with her . : 29.855060410078142
the others have been gone on to scarborough , these three weeks ." she could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success . : 14.657362900584896
he stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady ' s whispering to elizabeth again , he walked away . : 23.810004672538938
they were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself . : 13.939906402594199
bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them . : 11.007516535139587
" well girls ," said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " what say you to the day ? : 19.895937936744286
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw . : 25.548378344991338
the venison was roasted to a turn -- and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch . : 13.26966100854925
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas ' s last week ; and even mr . : 16.581827537580782
darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least . : 13.082856054475423
and , my dear jane , i never saw you look in greater beauty . : 20.831417227982104
long said so too , for i asked her whether you did not . : 19.743872016668934
and what do you think she said besides ? : 38.40602799489704
' ah ! : 414.8939562848667
bennet , we shall have her at netherfield at last .' she did indeed . : 22.625584629061187
i do think mrs . : 63.02261522401674
long is as good a creature as ever lived -- and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : i like them prodigiously ." mrs . : 10.096439506586481
bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of bingley ' s behaviour to jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals . : 13.978112100453751
" it has been a very agreeable day ," said miss bennet to elizabeth . : 29.676609725367815
" the party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other . : 19.966115348629717
" lizzy , you must not do so . : 40.30125137242048
you must not suspect me . : 44.478285194929235
it mortifies me . : 132.90602688901635
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it . : 10.544776136199896
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . : 12.222292282709512
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man ." " you are very cruel ," said her sister , " you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment ." " how hard it is in some cases to be believed !" " and how impossible in others !" " but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge ?" " that is a question which i hardly know how to answer . : 11.700437500226098
forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make _me_ your confidante ." chapter xiii . : 9.78909952810482
a few days after this visit , mr . : 22.341542504230834
bingley called again , and alone . : 58.922180860489526
he sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits . : 19.270597767300536
bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere . : 16.984467184544044
" next time you call ," said she , " i hope we shall be more lucky ." he should be particularly happy at any time , & c . : 10.657176627058579
& c .; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them . : 11.552720149284578
" can you come to - morrow ?" yes , he had no engagement at all for to - morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity . : 15.132624548122417
he came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed . : 25.923106018149188
he is come -- mr . : 38.64890679320392
bingley is come .-- he is , indeed . : 39.06937916795995
make haste , make haste . : 37.103592421821546
what has she to do with it ? : 59.17889944899319
come be quick , be quick ! : 28.420610909798913
where is your sash my dear ?" but when her mother was gone , jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters . : 15.087733736370192
the same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening . : 23.060183628041653
after tea , mr . : 44.65070261265934
bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and mary went up stairs to her instrument . : 20.122134560737788
two obstacles of the five being thus removed , mrs . : 16.268333783455365
bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them . : 10.867649539625521
elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last kitty did , she very innocently said , " what is the matter mamma ? : 16.9247092103745
what am i to do ?" " nothing child , nothing . : 22.41301097537948
i did not wink at you ." she then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to kitty , " come here , my love , i want to speak to you ," took her out of the room . : 12.42124362131584
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it . : 14.041906432119863
in a few minutes , mrs . : 31.845369624079936
bennet half opened the door and called out , " lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you ." elizabeth was forced to go . : 16.37045943473414
" we may as well leave them by themselves you know ;" said her mother as soon as she was in the hall . : 17.27197085586575
" kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing - room ." elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing - room . : 11.35824262584749
bennet ' s schemes for this day were ineffectual . : 18.121107351773492
bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter . : 15.748344235469515
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill - judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter . : 11.584832772464793
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and mrs . : 11.267472340418717
bennet ' s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband . : 20.773661846625284
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley ; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless mr . : 11.1431944983883
darcy returned within the stated time . : 26.6823937675298
seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman ' s concurrence . : 14.570617625564514
bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and mr . : 21.56173989724616
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected . : 21.854512188611547
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him . : 11.413927952232726
bennet ' s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter . : 17.190700864756128
elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother ' s schemes . : 12.175532309253969
but on returning to the drawing - room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her . : 15.355776564383326
on opening the door , she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all . : 10.543121725782369
_their_ situation was awkward enough ; but _her ' s_ she thought was still worse . : 9.274825385973287
not a syllable was uttered by either ; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room . : 12.539328428196844
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world . : 14.136853281810174
"' tis too much !" she added , " by far too much . : 12.443853951721865
i do not deserve it . : 43.26798469048915
why is not every body as happy ?" elizabeth ' s congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express . : 11.704035018881681
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane . : 18.418022477176372
" i must go instantly to my mother ;" she cried . : 23.838777861491142
how shall i bear so much happiness !" she then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with kitty . : 12.482101779056165
elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation . : 9.325736879666527
of all his sister ' s falsehood and contrivance ! : 30.084979749531364
the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end !" in a few minutes she was joined by bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose . : 13.979022688662331
she will be down in a moment i dare say ." he then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister . : 14.718813788908491
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship . : 19.383804690697996
they shook hands with great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of jane ' s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super - excellent disposition of jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself . : 11.283590014826304
it was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of miss bennet ' s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever . : 11.532709700098453
kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon . : 13.90816645932869
bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when mr . : 12.200888719180647
bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was . : 12.832621421134693
not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " jane , i congratulate you . : 13.741950392664934
you will be a very happy woman ." jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness . : 17.49052527958947
" you are a good girl ;" he replied , " and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . : 14.192099314097348
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together . : 21.846162412341393
your tempers are by no means unlike . : 21.813693876649662
you are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income ." " i hope not so . : 12.466369588781351
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in _me_ ." " exceed their income ! : 9.078457076896777
bennet ," cried his wife , " what are you talking of ? : 23.147853290702383
why , he has four or five thousand a - year , and very likely more ." then addressing her daughter , " oh ! : 11.659277782119112
my dear , dear jane , i am so happy ! : 24.453303000687246
i am sure i sha ' nt get a wink of sleep all night . : 7.3252488601341765
i knew how it would be . : 54.31300237939151
i always said it must be so , at last . : 32.853927646240905
i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! : 21.83955515062881
i remember , as soon as ever i saw him , when he first came into hertfordshire last year , i thought how likely it was that you should come together . : 15.723773147307135
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen !" wickham , lydia , were all forgotten . : 16.87647580842071
jane was beyond competition her favourite child . : 23.212836180098492
at that moment , she cared for no other . : 32.575407396190975
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense . : 16.128009222464332
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield ; and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter . : 13.700902043238715
bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept . : 9.832082757589161
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur . : 12.459131541469802
" he has made me so happy ," said she , one evening , " by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! : 15.647990663574976
i had not believed it possible ." " i suspected as much ," replied elizabeth . : 20.529352240468878
" but how did he account for it ?" " it must have been his sister ' s doing . : 19.668313914137702
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which i cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . : 12.88675668327635
but when they see , as i trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other ." " that is the most unforgiving speech ," said elizabeth , " that i ever heard you utter . : 12.822865067401334
it would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of miss bingley ' s pretended regard ." " would you believe it , lizzy , that when he went to town last november , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again !" " he made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty ." this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities . : 11.402079343599684
elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him . : 13.962727489398727
" i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed !" cried jane . : 12.84851309478771
lizzy , why am i thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ! : 14.664689603521614
if i could but see _you_ as happy ! : 23.635167342986854
if there _were_ but such another man for you !" " if you were to give me forty such men , i never could be so happy as you . : 14.519076759416487
collins in time ." the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret . : 15.569444466552131
bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs . : 19.54801579564974
philips , and _she_ ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton . : 19.63770301958389
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune . : 13.021391416206988
one morning , about a week after bingley ' s engagement with jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining - room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn . : 11.63369487649617
it was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours . : 19.91952989970105
the horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them . : 15.225845418508152
as it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery . : 13.945542499723885
they both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered . : 14.755363411805366
it was lady catherine de bourgh . : 36.9400405800158
they were of course all intending to be surprised ; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of mrs . : 15.920409120519583
bennet and kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what elizabeth felt . : 20.577015186557404
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to elizabeth ' s salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word . : 13.351712544902254
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship ' s entrance , though no request of introduction had been made . : 16.528831800394144
bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness . : 12.214921944010497
after sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to elizabeth , " i hope you are well , miss bennet . : 16.51387318186345
that lady i suppose is your mother ." elizabeth replied very concisely that she was . : 19.181449120008487
" and _that_ i suppose is one of your sisters ." " yes , madam ," said mrs . : 15.9772700026471
bennet , delighted to speak to a lady catherine . : 34.55921443161707
" she is my youngest girl but one . : 29.488250955944412
" it is nothing in comparison of rosings , my lady , i dare say ; but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas ' s ." " this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full west ." mrs . : 11.210904193065803
bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added , " may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr . : 10.851481294769995
collins well ." " yes , very well . : 29.266436846748448
i saw them the night before last ." elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling . : 15.661133514004142
bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ; but lady catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ; and then rising up , said to elizabeth , " miss bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn . : 12.237598826696253
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage ." elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs . : 14.479222758611922
as they passed through the hall , lady catherine opened the doors into the dining - parlour and drawing - room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on . : 9.41473549817096
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable . : 11.309764065894415
" how could i ever think her like her nephew ?" said she , as she looked in her face . : 17.949337792029016
" indeed , you are mistaken , madam . : 40.618327231604724
i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here ." " miss bennet ," replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to know , that i am not to be trifled with . : 16.14585591143305
but however insincere _you_ may choose to be , you shall not find _me_ so . : 17.43154938933464
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , i shall certainly not depart from it . : 11.286803342718644
a report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago . : 16.914541396675453
i was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that _you_ , that miss elizabeth bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , mr . : 15.778788246023469
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? : 32.44101002648165
has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ? : 17.36946784373692
do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ?" " i never heard that it was ." " and can you likewise declare , that there is no _foundation_ for it ?" " i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship . : 11.266458988738755
_you_ may ask questions , which _i_ shall not choose to answer ." " this is not to be borne . : 14.962164775031706
miss bennet , i insist on being satisfied . : 29.830739697941784
has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ?" " your ladyship has declared it to be impossible ." " it ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason . : 13.525314267933929
but _your_ arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family . : 12.127955240871504
you may have drawn him in ." " if i have , i shall be the last person to confess it ." " miss bennet , do you know who i am ? : 19.942045745474537
i have not been accustomed to such language as this . : 18.530793509224033
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns ." " but you are not entitled to know _mine_ ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit ." " let me be rightly understood . : 10.275544550940936
this match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place . : 17.09766830780605
no , never . : 168.53122020230538
darcy is engaged to _my daughter_ . : 23.20960259962361
now what have you to say ?" " only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me ." lady catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , " the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . : 15.138901772794158
it was the favourite wish of _his_ mother , as well as of her ' s . : 22.27053408971901
while in their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family ! : 12.891672325422059
to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh ? : 26.263693306718427
are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? : 15.341566347302136
have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ?" " yes , and i had heard it before . : 16.40191119268238
but what is that to me ? : 63.615784154991175
if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , i shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh . : 13.695870966836576
you both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage . : 24.82015933911183
its completion depended on others . : 22.01360895647645
darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? : 11.018378656141786
and if i am that choice , why may not i accept him ?" " because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it . : 9.342355984830293
yes , miss bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all . : 14.01536035816734
you will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him . : 15.917218678120564
your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us ." " these are heavy misfortunes ," replied elizabeth . : 11.74544367743256
i am ashamed of you ! : 77.70982576087081
is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? : 22.186314351594362
is nothing due to me on that score ? : 37.20670594693007
" let us sit down . : 57.55333193624046
you are to understand , miss bennet , that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will i be dissuaded from it . : 9.881059545634326
i have not been used to submit to any person ' s whims . : 21.28750165868109
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment ." " _that_ will make your ladyship ' s situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on _me_ ." " i will not be interrupted . : 12.3276616741865
hear me in silence . : 67.79815114722851
they are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father ' s , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled families . : 15.816445665109843
their fortune on both sides is splendid . : 18.313392163656616
they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ; and what is to divide them ? : 13.856854825689329
the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune . : 22.89918937673339
is this to be endured ! : 95.43852812069244
but it must not , shall not be . : 51.263053364684716
if you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up ." " in marrying your nephew , i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere . : 12.3790642429602
he is a gentleman ; i am a gentleman ' s daughter ; so far we are equal ." " true . : 19.958956231972696
you _are_ a gentleman ' s daughter . : 37.88868561803711
who are your uncles and aunts ? : 18.532055052932968
" and will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ?" " i will make no promise of the kind ." " miss bennet i am shocked and astonished . : 16.255417514614894
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman . : 32.48864719648525
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede . : 22.189927469944603
i shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance i require ." " and i certainly _never_ shall give it . : 15.0269726656022
your ladyship wants mr . : 46.2424143381356
darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished - for promise , make _their_ marriage at all more probable ? : 10.423837928376344
supposing him to be attached to me , would _my_ refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? : 14.996268262917472
allow me to say , lady catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill - judged . : 11.61102360714317
you have widely mistaken my character , if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these . : 14.759317846213003
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs , i cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine . : 10.319467091966192
i have by no means done . : 40.271101941471024
to all the objections i have already urged , i have still another to add . : 18.45789125485804
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister ' s infamous elopement . : 19.935969839347944
i know it all ; that the young man ' s marrying her , was a patched - up business , at the expence of your father and uncles . : 17.89305754815544
and is _such_ a girl to be my nephew ' s sister ? : 31.763734010238817
is _her_ husband , is the son of his late father ' s steward , to be his brother ? : 23.259603095097646
heaven and earth !-- of what are you thinking ? : 13.933084635078796
are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted ?" " you can _now_ have nothing farther to say ," she resentfully answered . : 12.301920769677052
" you have insulted me , in every possible method . : 32.03456292102643
i must beg to return to the house ." and she rose as she spoke . : 26.551303023383326
lady catherine rose also , and they turned back . : 22.774299062175544
her ladyship was highly incensed . : 46.17686550148
" you have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! : 25.725722431773406
unfeeling , selfish girl ! : 19.98466708246312
do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ?" " lady catherine , i have nothing farther to say . : 14.957106678006454
you know my sentiments ." " you are then resolved to have him ?" " i have said no such thing . : 17.29563991268651
you refuse , then , to oblige me . : 40.659479957953664
you refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude . : 15.208250043398488
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world ." " neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude ," replied elizabeth , " have any possible claim on me , in the present instance . : 14.70605079869344
no principle of either , would be violated by my marriage with mr . : 14.889921643215516
and with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ' s concern -- and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn ." " and this is your real opinion ! : 14.787507050076856
i shall now know how to act . : 33.39253630306913
do not imagine , miss bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified . : 16.468982922770994
i came to try you . : 66.21303438468034
i hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it i will carry my point ." in this manner lady catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , " i take no leave of you , miss bennet . : 12.910603368243695
i send no compliments to your mother . : 37.5887162081668
you deserve no such attention . : 52.60817501582511
i am most seriously displeased ." elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself . : 10.777075405589484
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing - room , to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself . : 15.307078429533718
" she did not choose it ," said her daughter , " she would go ." " she is a very fine - looking woman ! : 19.064681571099637
and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! : 22.757075199800905
for she only came , i suppose , to tell us the collinses were well . : 23.66424913601909
she is on her road somewhere , i dare say , and so passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you . : 16.145044005708506
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , lizzy ?" elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible . : 15.724366214200169
the discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly . : 10.476418932570258
lady catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr . : 8.840502913514058
it was a rational scheme to be sure ! : 33.22324638087936
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together . : 12.262535112146129
and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady catherine ) had only set _that_ down , as almost certain and immediate , which _she_ had looked forward to as possible , at some future time . : 8.514132260189639
in revolving lady catherine ' s expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference . : 13.27017758443776
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce . : 14.068186999784297
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_ , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side . : 11.353442910752033
with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning . : 9.627628399818425
in that case he would return no more . : 28.42634538631135
lady catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way . : 12.336843471610386
" if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days ," she added , " i shall know how to understand it . : 12.559091254959956
i shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy . : 17.760422072850748
if he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , i shall soon cease to regret him at all ." * * * * * the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased mrs . : 10.63281284640701
bennet ' s curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject . : 14.487956208675351
the next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand . : 20.980350719850975
" lizzy ," said he , " i was going to look for you ; come into my room ." she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held . : 13.530774508723361
i did not know before , that i had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony . : 19.07771781759569
let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest ." the colour now rushed into elizabeth ' s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , " you look conscious . : 11.935722975059093
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but i think i may defy even _your_ sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer . : 10.096362942705014
this letter is from mr . : 42.95223564450519
collins ." " from mr . : 66.2958655487939
and what can _he_ have to say ?" " something very much to the purpose of course . : 22.629691777005153
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good - natured , gossiping lucases . : 14.106380489720344
i shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point . : 14.269998561533182
what relates to yourself , is as follows . : 33.52789729049369
" having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs . : 12.463134179583475
collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another : of which we have been advertised by the same authority . : 10.867739914536669
yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate closure with this gentleman ' s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of ." " have you any idea , lizzy , who this gentleman is ? : 12.222890254971437
but now it comes out ." " my motive for cautioning you , is as follows . : 16.774385862168177
we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catherine de bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye ." " _mr . : 15.303435333878076
now , lizzy , i think i _have_ surprised you . : 20.841363387904075
darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life ! : 13.646556707583422
it is admirable !" elizabeth tried to join in her father ' s pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile . : 11.175876548464451
never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her . : 14.527439671655987
" are you not diverted ?" " oh ! : 27.64977615784594
i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned ." " mr . : 12.680474522012188
i must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . : 9.95650881849701
it was an encouragement of vice ; and had i been the rector of longbourn , i should very strenuously have opposed it . : 11.74005219619635
you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing ." " _that_ is his notion of christian forgiveness ! : 10.521041729192786
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte ' s situation , and his expectation of a young olive - branch . : 16.339715351763736
but , lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it . : 25.127131135302584
you are not going to be _missish_ , i hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report . : 18.484964615244476
for what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ?" " oh !" cried elizabeth , " i am excessively diverted . : 13.248228295716439
but it is so strange !" " yes -- _that_ is what makes it amusing . : 15.236623426094551
had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but _his_ perfect indifference , and _your_ pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd ! : 12.555506775731228
much as i abominate writing , i would not give up mr . : 20.290026850745814
collins ' s correspondence for any consideration . : 27.279597813122727
nay , when i read a letter of his , i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham , much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son - in - law . : 9.747630755332656
and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report ? : 23.8786484045188
did she call to refuse her consent ?" to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it . : 10.297623503087078
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not . : 18.686931848051138
her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of mr . : 23.54761573894903
darcy ' s indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too _little_ , she might have fancied too _much_ . : 11.834859032159965
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr . : 12.133420893765102
bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine ' s visit . : 14.805870178803861
the gentlemen arrived early ; and , before mrs . : 31.75016471466552
bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed their all walking out . : 12.690886596957535
it was agreed to . : 82.05251850132778
bennet was not in the habit of walking , mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together . : 12.559093438278104
bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them . : 16.645308701611654
they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy , were to entertain each other . : 26.39646189461997
very little was said by either ; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same . : 11.968939420358033
they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon maria ; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone . : 11.715454270760777
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , " mr . : 17.383081684819075
i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister . : 14.020255795126433
ever since i have known it , i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it . : 16.142305708622857
were it known to the rest of my family , i should not have merely my own gratitude to express ." " i am sorry , exceedingly sorry ," replied darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . : 11.997516711983144
gardiner was so little to be trusted ." " you must not blame my aunt . : 24.191651447889125
lydia ' s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , i could not rest till i knew the particulars . : 17.217689604123336
let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them ." " if you _will_ thank me ," he replied , " let it be for yourself alone . : 11.003491499621326
that the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny . : 16.60065817514571
but your _family_ owe me nothing . : 22.615897837531417
much as i respect them , i believe , i thought only of _you_ ." elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word . : 17.175282565409425
if your feelings are still what they were last april , tell me so at once . : 12.275930758347407
_my_ affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever ." elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances . : 9.296471011294946
the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do . : 13.243816005811485
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart - felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable . : 11.131149023940583
they walked on , without knowing in what direction . : 28.933753370247867
there was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects . : 27.827648358853974
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who _did_ call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship ' s apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which _she_ had refused to give . : 10.246116800883103
but , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise . : 19.396224524860248
" it taught me to hope ," said he , " as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before . : 17.900448058626438
for , though your accusations were ill - founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof . : 11.353151031985824
i cannot think of it without abhorrence ." " we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening ," said elizabeth . : 14.154985940033722
" the conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then , we have both , i hope , improved in civility ." " i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself . : 11.796770217370513
the recollection of what i then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me . : 18.21973522435001
your reproof , so well applied , i shall never forget : ' had you behaved in a more gentleman - like manner .' those were your words . : 8.68922322590776
you know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ;-- though it was some time , i confess , before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice ." " i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . : 11.104883575833307
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , i am sure you did . : 14.017455484687968
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget , as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me ." " oh ! : 15.058015743046884
do not repeat what i then said . : 27.705638491933087
these recollections will not do at all . : 33.046043913551244
i assure you , that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it ." darcy mentioned his letter . : 17.175397455461034
" did it ," said he , " did it _soon_ make you think better of me ? : 15.86739795628432
did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ?" she explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed . : 12.815673515752524
i hope you have destroyed the letter . : 36.755778674469354
there was one part especially , the opening of it , which i should dread your having the power of reading again . : 13.939405218134675
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me ." " the letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , i hope , quite so easily changed as that implies ." " when i wrote that letter ," replied darcy , " i believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit ." " the letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . : 9.457504544846993
the adieu is charity itself . : 39.03967620817015
but think no more of the letter . : 56.46516547059718
the feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten . : 16.090048442999485
you must learn some of my philosophy . : 44.251786139146716
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure ." " i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . : 12.113079806648983
_your_ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance . : 13.167469452636666
but with _me_ , it is not so . : 35.871141902014685
painful recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be repelled . : 16.016428835233224
i have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . : 18.30157769702771
i was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . : 17.24087627203491
unfortunately an only son , ( for many years an only _child_ ) i was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable ,) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own . : 8.017033171189668
such i was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such i might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest elizabeth ! : 15.339348079601667
what do i not owe you ! : 23.34011908707486
you taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . : 14.715530034468317
i came to you without a doubt of my reception . : 33.268772541172574
you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased ." " had you then persuaded yourself that i should ?" " indeed i had . : 12.69828931776823
what will you think of my vanity ? : 59.350991308947805
i believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses ." " my manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally i assure you . : 13.504215593849148
i never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . : 13.992761073957302
how you must have hated me after _that_ evening ?" " hate you ! : 13.964761653553918
i was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction ." " i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at pemberley . : 11.911939426717051
you blamed me for coming ?" " no indeed ; i felt nothing but surprise ." " your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you . : 11.39868975141975
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness , and i confess that i did not expect to receive _more_ than my due ." " my object _then_ ," replied darcy , " was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that i was not so mean as to resent the past ; and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to . : 11.196070385802571
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell , but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you ." he then told her of georgiana ' s delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend . : 9.616184661638512
she expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther . : 17.391631594678323
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home . : 14.288735098516616
" what could become of mr . : 34.257970928652774
bingley and jane !" was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs . : 10.110315622143633
darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it . : 17.94644118515055
" i must ask whether you were surprised ?" said elizabeth . : 18.97934093440125
" not at all . : 85.75320867101449
when i went away , i felt that it would soon happen ." " that is to say , you had given your permission . : 19.796872406256075
i guessed as much ." and though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case . : 20.80294162347966
" on the evening before my going to london ," said he " i made a confession to him , which i believe i ought to have made long ago . : 17.005850405532176
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent . : 15.128217888034818
his surprise was great . : 86.23983864231296
he had never had the slightest suspicion . : 41.23697032683923
" did you speak from your own observation ," said she , " when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ?" " from the former . : 12.91032282174506
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here ; and i was convinced of her affection ." " and your assurance of it , i suppose , carried immediate conviction to him ." " it did . : 14.162294104763047
bingley is most unaffectedly modest . : 30.575836215390826
his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy . : 11.269314615553158
i was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him . : 18.00432332602229
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that i had known it , and purposely kept it from him . : 15.248711918077351
but his anger , i am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister ' s sentiments . : 13.723475478207313
he has heartily forgiven me now ." elizabeth longed to observe that mr . : 14.67399468061958
bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself . : 12.860360456769508
in anticipating the happiness of bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house . : 18.01242232108679
in the hall they parted . : 59.05602369853726
" my dear lizzy , where can you have been walking to ?" was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table . : 13.232199637523545
she had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge . : 20.5826243116822
she coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth . : 17.593402747169698
the evening passed quietly , unmarked by any thing extraordinary . : 20.0848705861432
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent . : 15.952039783040172
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ; and elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather _knew_ that she was happy , than _felt_ herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her . : 9.984051113212344
at night she opened her heart to jane . : 22.866141818562976
though suspicion was very far from miss bennet ' s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here . : 14.920790536157357
" you are joking , lizzy . : 41.08690017804764
this cannot be !-- engaged to mr . : 23.52529556857188
my sole dependence was on you ; and i am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . : 14.794164844543786
yet , indeed , i am in earnest . : 33.755128091991494
i speak nothing but the truth . : 66.79397444014731
he still loves me , and we are engaged ." jane looked at her doubtingly . : 19.702216594347515
" oh , lizzy ! : 87.49159041497923
it cannot be . : 195.82290469786435
_that_ is all to be forgot . : 60.609776350598935
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now . : 23.327988252054148
but in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable . : 19.277613820257194
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself ." miss bennet still looked all amazement . : 15.704005104550912
elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth . : 30.184860146583727
can it be really so ! : 35.79752384247351
yet now i must believe you ," cried jane . : 25.67590629569253
forgive the question -- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ?" " there can be no doubt of that . : 17.669697421762937
it is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . : 18.688076796222322
but are you pleased , jane ? : 65.79484764701361
shall you like to have such a brother ?" " very , very much . : 30.1765109117696
nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight . : 12.714990601793586
but we considered it , we talked of it as impossible . : 36.050854083722314
and do you really love him quite well enough ? : 29.5093066203851
oh , lizzy ! : 96.38675014758351
do any thing rather than marry without affection . : 21.594375501628523
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ?" " oh , yes ! : 18.350091684060924
you will only think i feel _more_ than i ought to do , when i tell you all ." " what do you mean ?" " why , i must confess , that i love him better than i do bingley . : 16.153437710800855
i am afraid you will be angry ." " my dearest sister , now _be_ be serious . : 15.114518827692764
i want to talk very seriously . : 44.75619043693056
let me know every thing that i am to know , without delay . : 23.579045058013666
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley ." another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment . : 8.372800108099565
when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing farther to wish . : 18.44490182064448
" now i am quite happy ," said she , " for you will be as happy as myself . : 18.353002283247207
i always had a value for him . : 38.5841622162807
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton ! : 19.132038571824975
i owe all that i know of it , to another , not to you ." elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy . : 28.710201235834095
she had been unwilling to mention bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend . : 13.916768485401322
but now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in lydia ' s marriage . : 20.077528516341456
all was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation . : 29.755898851915862
* * * * * " good gracious !" cried mrs . : 7.773723481916761
bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable mr . : 15.817108337043479
darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley ! : 16.323449891643683
what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? : 15.811429078796634
i had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company . : 14.433150911114458
what shall we do with him ? : 71.80756909728325
lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley ' s way ." elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet . : 11.231311157132623
as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , " mr . : 12.316368330757722
bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to - day ?" " i advise mr . : 11.581625409302413
darcy , and lizzy , and kitty ," said mrs . : 37.63624872398786
it is a nice long walk , and mr . : 23.345902391877953
darcy has never seen the view ." " it may do very well for the others ," replied mr . : 17.518917366595502
bingley ; " but i am sure it will be too much for kitty . : 19.039212880858784
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount , and elizabeth silently consented . : 17.997486428762706
as she went up stairs to get ready , mrs . : 20.585673180221185
bennet followed her , saying , " i am quite sorry , lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself . : 14.886115431419068
but i hope you will not mind it : it is all for jane ' s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then . : 14.417207509197128
so , do not put yourself to inconvenience ." during their walk , it was resolved that mr . : 14.507946243694157
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother ' s . : 23.49461798957416
she could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man . : 11.309938467695034
but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that mr . : 13.733987542982485
darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation . : 21.790291026691794
* * * * * in the evening , soon after mr . : 12.514258482479313
bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr . : 31.691460612197154
darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile . : 22.38608009326222
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " go to your father , he wants you in the library ." she was gone directly . : 13.967605277307747
her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious . : 19.545334360451083
are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ? : 27.057089708541298
have not you always hated him ?" how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! : 11.21091428970423
it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to mr . : 13.904509913021965
" or in other words , you are determined to have him . : 27.66163302045837
he is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane . : 13.321996811152188
we all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him ." " i do , i do like him ," she replied , with tears in her eyes , " i love him . : 14.197949355215497
you do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms ." " lizzy ," said her father , " i have given him my consent . : 12.724542960034716
he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask . : 17.49115969582347
i now give it to _you_ , if you are resolved on having him . : 22.880306689989037
but let me advise you to think better of it . : 29.375963660364075
i know your disposition , lizzy . : 42.83040207463783
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior . : 11.704541885233146
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . : 13.172591966608575
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery . : 21.284094143361582
you know not what you are about ." elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that mr . : 13.42917565039798
darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ' s incredulity , and reconcile him to the match . : 10.436479953421305
" well , my dear ," said he , when she ceased speaking , " i have no more to say . : 16.15604959203278
i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to any one less worthy ." to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what mr . : 12.447764956566562
darcy had voluntarily done for lydia . : 29.90329606090188
he heard her with astonishment . : 59.08242968447684
" this is an evening of wonders , indeed ! : 26.161877242625437
so much the better . : 50.49584523387779
it will save me a world of trouble and economy . : 16.26330351867518
had it been your uncle ' s doing , i must and _would_ have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way . : 11.963075708467128
collins ' s letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go -- saying , as she quitted the room , " if any young men come for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quite at leisure ." elizabeth ' s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour ' s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure . : 12.046664721591528
every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time . : 10.924271098427237
when her mother went up to her dressing - room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication . : 17.402216096956213
bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable . : 19.903349527960575
nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them . : 12.54354050472763
she began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself . : 13.249964917368851
" good gracious ! : 146.44444445163106
lord bless me ! : 41.99892976369225
only think ! : 324.1049921213319
dear me ! : 285.01353295940237
who would have thought it ! : 65.8697694624796
and is it really true ? : 77.08126113931235
my sweetest lizzy ! : 119.7787128936456
how rich and how great you will be ! : 27.487757782077598
what pin - money , what jewels , what carriages you will have ! : 17.29985120944467
jane ' s is nothing to it -- nothing at all . : 22.39500220274091
i am so pleased -- so happy . : 21.61086624637968
such a charming man !-- so handsome ! : 23.163666233332155
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before . : 16.98875766605969
i hope he will overlook it . : 34.90386284965988
dear , dear lizzy . : 60.06783627422882
a house in town ! : 141.07537598662998
every thing that is charming ! : 59.53483639878637
three daughters married ! : 89.74105040519129
ten thousand a year ! : 33.9052644462857
oh , lord ! : 64.16739953715883
i shall go distracted ." this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away . : 11.56123552069145
but before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her . : 26.92293803045373
" my dearest child ," she cried , " i can think of nothing else ! : 19.97528145102353
ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! : 20.27156264651375
' tis as good as a lord ! : 32.09302835820858
and a special licence . : 65.05295507912358
you must and shall be married by a special licence . : 24.72928991724427
but my dearest love , tell me what dish mr . : 18.47445793690892
darcy is particularly fond of , that i may have it to - morrow ." this was a sad omen of what her mother ' s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for . : 15.560557610949537
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for mrs . : 19.298992421849437
bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son - in - law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion . : 12.470251877414867
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and mr . : 15.563863532928488
bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem . : 18.453227611132807
" i admire all my three sons - in - law highly ," said he . : 11.56815831011013
" wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but i think i shall like _your_ husband quite as well as jane ' s ." chapter xviii . : 15.564415241608108
elizabeth ' s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted mr . : 15.113498876055841
darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her . : 17.671712272726886
" how could you begin ?" said she . : 28.277496057071243
" i can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ?" " i cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation . : 12.816253701944007
it is too long ago . : 57.68063001574781
i was in the middle before i knew that i _had_ begun ." " my beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners -- my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . : 11.43621381719768
it was very little less . : 64.39030298904585
i roused , and interested you , because i was so unlike _them_ . : 32.22111779231929
had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you . : 9.972184629132837
to be sure , you knew no actual good of me -- but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love ." " was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane , while she was ill at netherfield ?" " dearest jane ! : 11.882191199203342
who could have done less for her ? : 45.27068914248157
but make a virtue of it by all means . : 31.389895639009936
my good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last . : 10.175177175928004
what made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ? : 17.011628470487626
but i wonder how long you _would_ have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . : 19.253125913235035
i wonder when you _would_ have spoken , if i had not asked you ! : 16.683660860930104
my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect . : 14.882326279156455
_too much_ , i am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for i ought not to have mentioned the subject ? : 11.17276526134366
this will never do ." " you need not distress yourself . : 22.77503988237884
the moral will be perfectly fair . : 58.76361153232484
lady catherine ' s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts . : 12.265198568182178
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . : 12.07619451836211
my aunt ' s intelligence had given me hope , and i was determined at once to know every thing ." " lady catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . : 15.079054500812939
but tell me , what did you come down to netherfield for ? : 30.637667452342136
was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed ? : 18.215999515331887
or had you intended any more serious consequence ?" " my real purpose was to see _you_ , and to judge , if i could , whether i might ever hope to make you love me . : 14.254473884376349
my avowed one , or what i avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which i have since made ." " shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine , what is to befall her ?" " i am more likely to want time than courage , elizabeth . : 11.375555662294166
but i have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected ." from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr . : 11.719434997844974
darcy had been over - rated , elizabeth had never yet answered mrs . : 15.213720284393695
you supposed more than really existed . : 42.140085007177504
but _now_ suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err . : 8.96160294395514
you must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . : 17.73963150880334
i thank you , again and again , for not going to the lakes . : 29.37598768439729
how could i be so silly as to wish it ! : 31.541923408362162
we will go round the park every day . : 22.846587553860623
i am the happiest creature in the world . : 23.928574438818533
perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice . : 22.813073415206457
i am happier even than jane ; she only smiles , i laugh . : 20.52341727203896
darcy sends you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me . : 18.63762689864882
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas . : 24.56960041084252
darcy ' s letter to lady catherine , was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what mr . : 16.74048433315477
bennet sent to mr . : 57.568917603651656
collins , in reply to his last . : 47.85790501034268
" dear sir , " i must trouble you once more for congratulations . : 19.172500794997035
elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr . : 23.278075457697827
but , if i were you , i would stand by the nephew . : 29.88324575354562
he has more to give . : 84.31093225662896
she wrote even to jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard . : 19.26926611943253
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother ' s in sending it . : 12.758474096366093
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister . : 11.996324720911591
before any answer could arrive from mr . : 15.155979016541066
the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident . : 23.91922731749288
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew ' s letter , that charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over . : 12.542377687544224
at such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw mr . : 13.762310062378477
darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband . : 18.169190942085862
he bore it however with admirable calmness . : 22.5949064831337
he could even listen to sir william lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st . : 9.65556305094508
if he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till sir william was out of sight . : 11.678186354428329
philips ' s vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though mrs . : 13.864650582196147
philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley ' s good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she _did_ speak , she must be vulgar . : 11.81972908042543
nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant . : 17.375339351387264
elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley . : 11.72232821730125
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs . : 20.41859649143371
bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters . : 21.61800799584289
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs . : 13.836313942291977
bingley and talked of mrs . : 46.285662832485755
bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do . : 9.880921156772553
he delighted in going to pemberley , especially when he was least expected . : 23.278665587244593
bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth . : 22.570823586959403
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper , or _her_ affectionate heart . : 10.96213626156221
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire , and jane and elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other . : 12.427695515551893
in society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great . : 18.774183099864434
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia , and , removed from the influence of lydia ' s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid . : 11.320436858931734
from the farther disadvantage of lydia ' s society she was of course carefully kept , and though mrs . : 14.134247243635915
wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going . : 15.979931945912343
mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs . : 11.540058202411034
bennet ' s being quite unable to sit alone . : 19.27704083243378
mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance . : 11.391541594759135
as for wickham and lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters . : 17.234146718109955
the letter was to this effect : " my dear lizzy , " i wish you joy . : 18.40604267919076
if you love mr . : 51.910730432800435
darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham , you must be very happy . : 27.28341024394806
it is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , i hope you will think of us . : 20.644417577023216
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much , and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . : 11.364729427651655
any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to mr . : 15.898390068773455
darcy about it , if you had rather not . : 41.12999032975835
such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them . : 14.149960700112167
their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme . : 16.49507220608957
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought . : 11.826363279108005
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference ; her ' s lasted a little longer ; and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her . : 11.771857285921314
though darcy could never receive _him_ at pemberley , yet , for elizabeth ' s sake , he assisted him farther in his profession . : 14.383641562070068
lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath ; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even bingley ' s good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone . : 11.163255956293858
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy ' s marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of georgiana , almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth . : 7.956521490827699
they were able to love each other , even as well as they intended . : 22.017175991062917
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother . : 11.132273138964836
he , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry . : 11.476419012888265
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way . : 20.741832254747123
by elizabeth ' s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself . : 12.074276212716365
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end . : 11.474064103359197
but at length , by elizabeth ' s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city . : 11.299875710750076
with the gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms . : 27.633117384015495
darcy , as well as elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them . : 12.823175456531754
