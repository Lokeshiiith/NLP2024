CHAPTER I.:132.77087303100393
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.:17.738219956056223
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.:11.252164690767323
"My dear Mr.:51.929374582793706
Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"  Mr.:12.46860182409503
Bennet replied that he had not.:60.34166428759048
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs.:19.17639119805938
Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."  Mr.:16.586777334528694
Bennet made no answer.:49.64758568626641
"Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.:20.34257768509692
"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."  This was invitation enough.:17.312056954822886
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs.:23.71128627753039
Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr.:10.045168424888775
Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."  "What is his name?"  "Bingley."  "Is he married or single?"  "Oh!:13.617895613245476
What a fine thing for our girls!"  "How so?:19.98181756671907
how can it affect them?"  "My dear Mr.:15.999190390256143
Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome!:21.79669735196289
You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."  "Is that his design in settling here?"  "Design!:17.67893793870494
nonsense, how can you talk so!:18.001203589674017
Bingley might like you the best of the party."  "My dear, you flatter me.:17.489149384036313
When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."  "In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."  "But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr.:11.691197878918537
Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."  "It is more than I engage for, I assure you."  "But consider your daughters.:17.595672566525202
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new comers.:10.286683820674641
Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not."  "You are over scrupulous surely.:15.422260112817543
I dare say Mr.:57.59361555216676
Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."  "I desire you will do no such thing.:12.94073462210063
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia.:15.34249224278247
But you are always giving _her_ the preference."  "They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."  "Mr.:10.13089278690377
You have no compassion on my poor nerves."  "You mistake me, my dear.:19.261326247584552
I have a high respect for your nerves.:27.475814864320903
They are my old friends.:32.86151585496957
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."  "Ah!:12.605869683811788
you do not know what I suffer."  "But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."  "It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not visit them."  "Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all."  Mr.:11.374359411153835
Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.:9.362974667019163
_Her_ mind was less difficult to develope.:18.655448959332578
She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper.:19.090240828231174
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous.:19.902764126950533
The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.:13.833491202810444
Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.:13.842317252350421
It was then disclosed in the following manner.:37.259426921379855
Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with,  "I hope Mr.:9.820779391055265
Bingley will like it Lizzy."  "We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr.:21.334005990687235
Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit."  "But you forget, mama," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs.:15.163425780932927
Long has promised to introduce him."  "I do not believe Mrs.:14.288422053423151
Long will do any such thing.:33.48477096539015
She has two nieces of her own.:44.01431766148897
She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her."  "No more have I," said Mr.:16.48167051313629
Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you."  Mrs.:18.304407252359503
Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.:16.54805292125788
Have a little compassion on my nerves.:31.206647132051327
You tear them to pieces."  "Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times them ill."  "I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully.:11.716091356792969
"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"  "To-morrow fortnight."  "Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs.:17.58746099168934
Long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself."  "Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr.:17.519118376508782
Bingley to _her_."  "Impossible, Mr.:29.54102857143669
Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teazing?"  "I honour your circumspection.:12.799129823740905
A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little.:34.22909078392925
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight.:24.69100188879662
But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs.:14.136382688527547
Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself."  The girls stared at their father.:12.783065129939656
Bennet said only, "Nonsense, nonsense!"  "What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he.:14.042881320704701
"Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense?:17.997172019842463
What say you, Mary?:87.45711992696945
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts."  Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.:12.85944008635852
"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr.:11.698688963537505
Bingley."  "I am sick of Mr.:24.143614303920025
Bingley," cried his wife.:52.46441117256789
"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before?:20.318725019424527
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.:14.335909004623003
"How good it was in you, my dear Mr.:27.217864988992567
Bennet!:4551.1499287748675
But I knew I should persuade you at last.:32.42372235998911
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance.:13.525980509044654
Well, how pleased I am!:60.04946503216827
and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now."  "Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr.:13.064387624308402
Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.:23.245417057609515
"What an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was shut.:17.874873140933115
"I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter.:15.294450284570223
At our time of life, it is not so pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing.:15.322646025095912
Bingley will dance with you at the next ball."  "Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the youngest, I'm the tallest."  The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr.:9.467595754822678
Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.:22.443624798796904
CHAPTER III.:110.2249848057666
Not all that Mrs.:111.16333287426859
Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr.:12.197655123090112
Her report was highly favourable.:49.73253252573689
Sir William had been delighted with him.:34.892552187209
He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party.:13.786327460901823
Nothing could be more delightful!:48.096864877518975
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr.:14.596994216702509
Bingley's heart were entertained.:25.914254990691557
"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield," said Mrs.:14.903460197760706
Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for."  In a few days Mr.:18.86900568818251
Bingley returned Mr.:90.50935596503928
Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library.:20.947423303834125
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.:14.635998797283033
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.:8.577713803286988
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs.:17.306555644588844
Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.:12.340879872882729
Bennet was quite disconcerted.:68.29731862984585
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.:12.18567301855859
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr.:10.268407194787914
Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.:18.46849661705209
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin.:12.587296521258024
Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.:32.044673966692336
Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.:12.849884908269468
His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.:14.448261123103178
His brother-in-law, Mr.:15.731593182684774
Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr.:17.423792716149478
Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.:10.565843678530632
Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.:10.390923653554559
Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.:11.359009152993906
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves.:22.285503828470382
What a contrast between him and his friend!:31.926682455818245
Darcy danced only once with Mrs.:25.329250483655127
Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.:11.516159273830663
His character was decided.:64.15878722974259
He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.:15.717881579890706
Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his having slighted one of her daughters.:16.16182180035231
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.:16.140263499575866
Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr.:14.410296361107353
Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.:19.80904287284094
"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance.:23.887648257325047
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.:14.297529970434098
You had much better dance."  "I certainly shall not.:28.466115793762153
You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner.:20.938376555911585
At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable.:25.528869356897133
Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with."  "I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Bingley, "for a kingdom!:16.058607165145197
Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty."  "_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr.:11.77891183600318
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.:31.791702744364144
she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!:24.44922224596254
But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say, very agreeable.:18.223388672083598
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."  Mr.:13.29960329950028
Bingley followed his advice.:54.44103139108273
Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.:14.51626708350145
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.:13.165466206363423
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.:22.775492839566084
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.:18.434467297620238
Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.:22.147740498594338
Jane was as much gratified by this, as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.:26.762097282264108
Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure.:47.490854191296535
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.:13.533203759300863
They found Mr.:106.91259262148532
Bennet still up.:105.18826565025192
With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations.:13.192988761083232
He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear.:17.034352856936906
my dear Mr.:64.39728482220839
Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.:21.598366000521334
I wish you had been there.:51.29915254429828
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.:24.795330272862493
Every body said how well she looked; and Mr.:17.236766178049066
Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice.:26.1419613870374
Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time.:15.530653012402011
First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.:47.50648910757608
I was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance.:14.163917524952476
So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.:29.649360116861875
Then, the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger----"  "If he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much!:11.765913850720684
For God's sake, say no more of his partners.:23.475113670745372
Oh!:342.4436903211594
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!"  "Oh!:15.267477162825118
my dear," continued Mrs.:31.9165183765567
He is so excessively handsome!:53.60651865914437
and his sisters are charming women.:36.45551203226398
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses.:14.015145500119617
I dare say the lace upon Mrs.:18.41958044640555
Hurst's gown----"  Here she was interrupted again.:20.14871122540706
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr.:11.146862153028389
"But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing.:9.96873454237872
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him!:18.508626579395695
He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great!:24.351817434675137
Not handsome enough to dance with!:53.60447062670308
I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set downs.:23.198783267640838
I quite detest the man."     CHAPTER IV.:25.907057237468244
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr.:18.82570295696265
Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him.:20.164583627094164
His character is thereby complete."  "I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.:15.102027457580796
I did not expect such a compliment."  "Did not you?:35.60355514361691
_I_ did for you.:38.11342438390585
But that is one great difference between us.:27.583446175887357
Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.:15.264600510339676
What could be more natural than his asking you again?:20.634096754983847
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room.:10.554646064224679
No thanks to his gallantry for that.:44.517025477023935
Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.:23.42433175826285
You have liked many a stupider person."  "Dear Lizzy!"  "Oh!:15.398478411800625
you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.:18.2525234145958
You never see a fault in any body.:28.9549381130816
All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes.:19.881488836360038
But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad--belongs to you alone.:12.047176788715781
Their manners are not equal to his."  "Certainly not; at first.:27.27222235495479
But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them.:20.875727449933304
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her."  Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them.:10.180569981162202
They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.:11.176900279092097
They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others.:10.28114047801077
Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it.--Mr.:10.846686839053962
Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.:11.616418132096788
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs.:12.340404370939348
Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.:10.543974707162342
Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House.:12.564911007163442
He did look at it and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.:13.556818554701298
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character.--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied.:9.168206331489777
In understanding Darcy was the superior.:68.73816349246005
Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever.:20.088925796519923
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.:22.35412176337566
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence.:13.162144269647614
Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure.:10.815763300142622
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.:21.520479765858187
CHAPTER V.:110.2249848057666
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate.:10.688788896405828
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty.:9.704379330121272
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.:16.7708254768524
For though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to every body.:14.221574050447169
By nature inoffensive, friendly and obliging, his presentation at St.:9.968312668995942
James's had made him courteous.:21.421003167648596
Bennet.--They had several children.:35.472581444879935
The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth's intimate friend.:16.297663802156166
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.:12.668670451139448
"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs.:25.257972516444784
Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas.:18.93551228031253
"_You_ were Mr.:61.178193866113986
To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he _did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something about Mr.:9.455251061170674
Robinson."  "Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr.:13.556507956027295
Robinson; did not I mention it to you?:22.400199816932584
Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest?:11.395931623975905
and his answering immediately to the last question--Oh!:24.57590693562357
the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point."  "Upon my word!--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know."  "_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza," said Charlotte.:10.956768979710217
"Mr.:237.14005915785373
Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_."  "I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.:11.522944276655787
Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips."  "Are you quite sure, Ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?" said Jane.--"I certainly saw Mr.:9.30776723157565
Darcy speaking to her."  "Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to."  "Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance.:11.179477379793541
Long.:954.6850139378857
But I can guess how it was; every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs.:13.189339644495863
Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise."  "I do not mind his not talking to Mrs.:13.569715898035852
Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I wish he had danced with Eliza."  "Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with _him_, if I were you."  "I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him."  "His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it.:11.047143796253929
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour, should think highly of himself.:14.261978821084137
If I may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud."  "That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_."  "Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, "is a very common failing I believe.:11.333496939725501
By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary.:10.519114273457918
Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonimously.:9.952177594784171
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."  "If I were as rich as Mr.:10.475094298610573
Darcy," cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters, "I should not care how proud I was.:17.132619764448556
I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day."  "Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs.:9.929940309218066
Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly."  The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.:13.380652767587291
CHAPTER VI.:110.2249848057666
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.:20.877042161558464
The visit was returned in due form.:25.170257896526504
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the two eldest.:13.6149864998165
It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.:12.352252198882626
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.:36.23882364428311
"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded.:14.96747736674662
If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark.:13.127122453369243
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.:12.040057171284552
We can all _begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.:9.932649540415404
In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels.:13.87214523979632
If _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too."  "Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do."  "But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out."  "Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.:13.051672220506353
Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention.:14.655301378928064
When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses."  "Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.:11.882013206868569
But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.:25.463740024791825
As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness.:23.766349417373355
She has known him only a fortnight.:40.05395290209478
She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times.:14.42201975705537
This is not quite enough to make her understand his character."  "Not as you represent it.:18.012257484173507
Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal."  "Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded."  "Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth.:9.286559839227055
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.:12.937064665198857
If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the least.:11.84122942734219
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life."  "You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.:11.218218459919061
You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."  Occupied in observing Mr.:15.195302000771612
Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.:15.098029839468348
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.:12.220662886548109
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.:21.354096973907925
Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.:10.678799086601925
Of this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.:14.912531009144791
His doing so drew her notice.:28.449438398244883
It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were assembled.:17.936694620356725
Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?"  "That is a question which Mr.:15.032410462070844
Darcy only can answer."  "But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about.:15.784600462857936
He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him."  On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,  "Did not you think, Mr.:12.08001539915335
Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?"  "With great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic."  "You are severe on us."  "It will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said Miss Lucas.:9.951124993275343
"I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows."  "You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body!--If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers." On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, she added, "Very well; if it must be so, it must." And gravely glancing at Mr.:9.71813129886394
Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of course familiar with--'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and I shall keep mine to swell my song."  Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.:7.25897822665107
After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.:11.599476760468837
Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.:8.852552441703986
Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.:9.399626982269842
Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.:11.34015414615625
"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr.:17.599667326572487
"Your friend performs delightfully;" he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;--"and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.:10.094394740803635
Do you often dance at St.:21.96378630243539
James's?"  "Never, sir."  "Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"  "It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it."  "You have a house in town, I conclude?"  Mr.:14.25514875355443
"I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas."  He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her,  "My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?--Mr.:10.308147345495929
Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you." And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr.:12.753823067172714
Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,  "Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.--I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."  Mr.:11.720334885293799
Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand; but in vain.:16.59219324905706
Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.:12.336776332466462
"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half hour."  "Mr.:11.094290613904
Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling.:25.92918712479351
Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,  "I can guess the subject of your reverie."  "I should imagine not."  "You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.:12.525147477304916
The insipidity and yet the noise; the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--What would I give to hear your strictures on them!"  "Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.:8.350587605038042
My mind was more agreeably engaged.:38.89875104378339
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."  Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.:10.1443127743552
Darcy replied with great intrepidity,  "Miss Elizabeth Bennet."  "Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley.:16.975768629469314
"I am all astonishment.:52.12821552060036
How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am I to wish you joy?"  "That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.:11.238119005953104
A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.:13.11688037951847
I knew you would be wishing me joy."  "Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled.:14.474029597617655
You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you."  He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.:11.940344401512293
CHAPTER VII.:110.2249848057666
Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his.:9.467456996316146
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.:16.10501317029492
Philips, who had been a clerk to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.:15.449747130259686
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way.:10.694690899300443
The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt.:8.169410684519054
At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the head quarters.:13.23194860750655
Their visits to Mrs.:51.951796136463436
Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence.:21.30133765301408
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections.:14.678400066520316
Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves.:19.48521548687332
Philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before.:13.053931292497188
Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.:13.284690828923223
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.:15.269380353308511
I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced."  Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London.:11.876920850058825
"I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs.:18.390446086354192
Bennet, "that you should be so ready to think your own children silly.:21.108509373539285
If I wished to think slightingly of any body's children, it should not be of my own however."  "If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it."  "Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."  "This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.:14.830790005808856
I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish."  "My dear Mr.:10.183131580000484
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals."  "Mama," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library."  Mrs.:9.255748045412806
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer.:12.369935861017156
Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,  "Well, Jane, who is it from?:16.303094225182274
what is it about?:80.34646506462458
what does he say?:61.212221116352026
Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."  "It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud.:13.743723946683875
"My dear Friend,       "If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and      me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our      lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never      end without a quarrel.:9.843596012901571
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of      this.:26.334409514881788
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.:36.84340832517361
Yours ever,       "CAROLINE BINGLEY."  "With the officers!" cried Lydia.:25.98520410889424
Bennet, "that is very unlucky."  "Can I have the carriage?" said Jane.:22.19937936846103
"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night."  "That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home."  "Oh!:12.026706920018182
but the gentlemen will have Mr.:46.598646011556006
Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs."  "I had much rather go in the coach."  "But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.:11.230222072535854
They are wanted in the farm, Mr.:22.31673574992592
Bennet, are not they?"  "They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them."  "But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose will be answered."  She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged.:12.418808606361447
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day.:14.62758106853235
Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.:30.213684412241523
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back.:14.618495278064387
Bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.:19.59969292840511
Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance.:18.22524860179459
Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:       "My dearest Lizzy,       "I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be      imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.:9.922519323851049
My kind friends will      not hear of my returning home till I am better.:21.15268946777655
They insist also on      my seeing Mr.:21.92913355768097
Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear      of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache      there is not much the matter with me.:9.747904780720443
Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr.:11.4755837608376
Bingley, and under your orders."  "Oh!:22.407253320965957
I am not at all afraid of her dying.:35.32608476811688
People do not die of little trifling colds.:19.01327935465754
She will be taken good care of.:36.62093148600198
As long as she stays there, it is all very well.:25.471151823343565
I would go and see her, if I could have the carriage."  Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking was her only alternative.:15.602822844249625
She declared her resolution.:91.00886250474412
"How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt!:17.949906637783617
You will not be fit to be seen when you get there."  "I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want."  "Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the horses?"  "No, indeed.:13.72102606070896
I do not wish to avoid the walk.:31.091750771575093
I shall be back by dinner."  "I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."  "We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and Lydia.--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.:9.704700313446779
"If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes."  In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.:7.673722138095797
She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.--That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs.:11.101678611683091
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it.:14.218797025132101
Darcy said very little, and Mr.:37.744435843814706
Hurst nothing at all.:43.95286142095327
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone.:14.164659016058451
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.:37.03916178638903
Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room.:17.084473113914882
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.:14.053211339611394
She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with.:13.370864081737759
Elizabeth silently attended her.:69.7920161272761
When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane.:13.948360804389363
The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.:13.545831657790648
The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.:15.568803748768262
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere.:14.13293966255239
When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very unwillingly said so.:16.303324882794044
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.:11.097429905759128
Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.:11.34666348996389
CHAPTER VIII.:110.2249848057666
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.:10.192774112477275
To the civil enquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr.:9.554566922838783
Jane was by no means better.:33.171501328618334
The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.:10.206587042834105
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency.:22.15800476579314
His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others.:16.012748747092385
She had very little notice from any but him.:21.105558946055535
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr.:23.39444854818669
Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.:25.44604672595026
Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.:10.049385365409062
Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.:15.26144189474475
Hurst thought the same, and added,  "She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker.:22.297244909034067
She really looked almost wild."  "She did indeed, Louisa.:24.403382415892658
I could hardly keep my countenance.:34.984646541523894
Why must _she_ be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold?:16.032715763340025
Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!"  "Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it, not doing its office."  "Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but this was all lost upon me.:9.382454487059045
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well, when she came into the room this morning.:17.49734875309008
Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition."  "Certainly not."  "To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!:10.916060542272705
what could she mean by it?:42.657617018181206
"I am afraid, Mr.:26.786724000441804
Darcy," observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes."  "Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise."--A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs.:10.126972855237527
Hurst began again.:58.230861501891795
"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled.:15.151333021864216
But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it."  "I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton."  "Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."  "That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.:12.11342220041748
"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it would not make them one jot less agreeable."  "But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world," replied Darcy.:10.371045476376281
To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.:10.37362063644127
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.:13.407275145417636
She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself.:12.935836596121977
On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book.:11.364965214486208
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else."  "I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things."  "In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; "and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well."  Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying.:9.748990966800678
"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever look into."  Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.:11.422649808809357
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place.:11.879412036979373
Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley."  "I wish it may."  "But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.:11.476968911429882
Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.:27.426451374453578
"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "will she be as tall as I am?"  "I think she will.:14.009877979087436
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or rather taller."  "How I long to see her again!:15.117019769278215
Such a countenance, such manners!:45.472642726075556
and so extremely accomplished for her age!:35.91087892811939
Her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite."  "It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished, as they all are."  "All young ladies accomplished!:13.455272858340281
My dear Charles, what do you mean?"  "Yes, all of them, I think.:18.282741643220483
They all paint tables, cover skreens and net purses.:7.890932000262298
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished."  "Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has too much truth.:12.327157191641843
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen.:9.187721394608136
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.:16.423798157906507
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished."  "Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley.:13.945664931817102
"Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman."  "Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it."  "Oh!:13.810678645733965
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved."  "All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading."  "I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.:9.942820695517016
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_."  "Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all this?"  "_I_ never saw such a woman.:12.284247956059888
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr.:8.872523156559776
As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.:15.115936764718501
"Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds.:13.758416179877736
But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."  "Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, "there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.:8.8931532863872
Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable."  Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.:9.640375535364631
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her.:22.32685740815228
Bingley urged Mr.:87.17750049186175
Jones's being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians.:9.53775133192821
Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better.:16.997741608612984
Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable.:20.613661736371274
They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.:9.248142215189466
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr.:14.240209948622383
Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.:16.997448036416984
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs.:20.01071846356042
Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.:12.581767729210123
She would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable.:12.694615294059407
After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour.:12.398777217806748
Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs.:21.950454031866176
Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.:23.33858470547893
"Indeed I have, Sir," was her answer.:26.733589298994662
"She is a great deal too ill to be moved.:25.0117635208498
We must trespass a little longer on your kindness."  "Removed!" cried Bingley.:16.11338074358327
"It must not be thought of.:65.55555659622641
My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal."  "You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, "that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us."  Mrs.:12.313904294815258
Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.:34.517651019073696
"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with.:12.831711775662408
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_.:20.749718650271163
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield.:22.338920745975308
At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here."  "That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth.:13.099962970114698
yes--I understand you perfectly."  "I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful."  "That is as it happens.:12.672497468023867
It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."  "Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."  "I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a studier of character.:10.264228689330091
It must be an amusing study."  "Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.:13.193011416024866
They have at least that advantage."  "The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for such a study.:13.568718570832214
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society."  "But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever."  "Yes, indeed," cried Mrs.:10.03243073090734
Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.:15.572507823376833
"I assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town."  Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away.:15.518199539136658
"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part, except the shops and public places.:8.243715540130918
The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr.:21.65267158858978
Bingley?"  "When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same.:18.752586068504236
But that gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing at all."  "Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother.:15.851091903841802
"You quite mistook Mr.:40.828188639731124
I know we dine with four and twenty families."  Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance.:10.373805788251016
Darcy with a very expressive smile.:51.53596072575764
Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.:10.140609362737344
"Yes, she called yesterday with her father.:35.694144759074675
What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr.:22.35856533972782
Bingley--is not he?:63.53272298771572
so much the man of fashion!:49.22271375875919
so genteel and so easy!--He has always something to say to every body.--_That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter."  "Did Charlotte dine with you?"  "No, she would go home.:9.696430113907162
I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies.:25.857853330904106
For my part, Mr.:35.074181128702534
But every body is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I assure you.:18.42743960097828
It is a pity they are not handsome!:33.75363846550123
Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend."  "She seems a very pleasant young woman," said Bingley.:10.91098557403857
Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty.:15.982131539942898
I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see any body better looking.:14.020042970711419
It is what every body says.:43.16716251169758
I do not trust my own partiality.:37.323383861623135
But however he did not.:67.34057103060286
Perhaps he thought her too young.:33.739646074800284
However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were."  "And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently.:15.817924444410952
"There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.:23.37881458739361
I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"  "I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said Darcy.:7.8960412208631485
"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.:21.252419378254206
Every thing nourishes what is strong already.:21.278177593526813
But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."  Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.:8.3544283591322
She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.:18.354468104989724
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr.:18.465581789173182
Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy.:14.123952473841564
Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required.:15.050189603361847
She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs.:14.356213364459862
Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.:28.43524773038385
Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.:18.60700910394513
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr.:15.97074046260398
Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age.:9.370891408940269
She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.:12.540575662837336
She was very equal therefore to address Mr.:18.17112665408496
Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.:14.97298069427962
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.:16.850545789614706
"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of the ball.:15.281324654289923
But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill."  Lydia declared herself satisfied.:17.876159590167877
yes--it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again.:13.214272525119526
I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."  Mrs.:14.849956431518635
Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr.:15.218880249098275
Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.:11.187875184941328
The day passed much as the day before had done.:33.12531000715919
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room.:12.683667334119644
The loo table, however, did not appear.:44.87039915502195
Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister.:12.309549288289595
Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.:32.43223999361536
Hurst was observing their game.:19.845389549968214
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion.:13.01632034437306
The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each.:12.19159693722284
"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"  He made no answer.:17.581160224565732
"You write uncommonly fast."  "You are mistaken.:20.731532307419243
I write rather slowly."  "How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year!:16.924809426499976
Letters of business too!:31.721880582039034
How odious I should think them!"  "It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours."  "Pray tell your sister that I long to see her."  "I have already told her so once, by your desire."  "I am afraid you do not like your pen.:10.96195562423316
Let me mend it for you.:25.835791532542004
"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's."  "Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?--At present I have not room to do them justice."  "Oh!:10.764692722715024
it is of no consequence.:57.8442839095191
But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr.:15.444613691540743
Darcy?"  "They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine."  "It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with ease, cannot write ill."  "That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease.:11.194712911283442
He studies too much for words of four syllables.--Do not you, Darcy?"  "My style of writing is very different from yours."  "Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable.:10.811265005536669
He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."  "My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."  "Your humility, Mr.:8.595436457528907
Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."  "Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of humility.:13.414688540477757
It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast."  "And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"  "The indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting.:8.573835256935975
When you told Mrs.:46.088703362186585
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?"  "Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning.:10.869294434046262
And yet, upon my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment.:21.406483766950227
At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies."  "I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity.:11.112214979263142
Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not go--and, at another word, might stay a month."  "You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr.:11.332461368818484
Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition.:34.41880107948282
You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself."  "I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.:11.686714868440086
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could."  "Would Mr.:10.598303326614719
Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"  "Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for himself."  "You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged.:8.210288721366757
Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety."  "To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you."  "To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either."  "You appear to me, Mr.:9.277001771977197
A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it.:9.081489758896375
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr.:18.100259469200992
We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon.:10.882970078060133
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"  "Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?"  "By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of.:9.332281188637523
I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do."  Mr.:12.623684247529239
Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh.:17.91593003876667
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.:11.93895628584103
"I see your design, Bingley," said his friend.--"You dislike an argument, and want to silence this."  "Perhaps I do.:14.087367674701795
Arguments are too much like disputes.:20.138916582309538
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."  "What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.:12.768347759926188
Darcy had much better finish his letter."  Mr.:18.440343857978736
Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.:24.617451409451757
When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music.:20.27521167609719
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.:10.652100919412398
Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr.:10.092861125510895
Darcy's eyes were fixed on her.:26.021794433553623
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange.:14.658304778315493
She could only imagine however at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present.:9.41975990661106
She liked him too little to care for his approbation.:26.931175245802237
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr.:9.824901971679406
He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.:28.41277296542998
You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt.:11.899083518946144
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if you dare."  "Indeed I do not dare."  Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.:11.823158610764303
He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.:27.60960377762364
Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.:13.084137028328456
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.:12.92208666136941
"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after the officers.--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses."  "Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"  "Oh!:8.429967282424812
yes.--Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley.:11.637124451153566
Put them next to your great uncle the judge.:15.51730106646418
They are in the same profession, you know; only in different lines.:18.020777165200496
As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"  "It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied."  At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs.:10.00436319218488
Hurst and Elizabeth herself.:78.59873064447306
Hurst, "in running away without telling us that you were coming out."  Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr.:9.352125039784125
Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself.:28.420713856366365
The path just admitted three.:43.44860290785092
We had better go into the avenue."  But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered,  "No, no; stay where you are.--You are charmingly group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage.:11.086818564153454
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.:19.068397530954147
Good bye."  She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two.:13.309288802256027
Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.:11.166649932412145
CHAPTER XI.:110.2249848057666
When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.:9.901345177141934
Their powers of conversation were considerable.:29.105867405418127
They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.:8.560803651164555
But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object.:25.40557964427619
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.:14.628585411791377
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr.:15.177611400106834
He was full of joy and attention.:27.647109712219
The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the door.:11.95834345608696
He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.:23.02405188455729
Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.:18.17780451646056
When tea was over, Mr.:26.266238288659377
Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table--but in vain.:12.215373496781877
She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.:17.62602661710259
Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr.:30.690126330126063
Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected.:11.0288319196976
She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her.:16.853806404394117
Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep.:12.451649273589583
Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs.:19.082152336221128
Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet.:10.149988293904796
Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.:15.48058437430306
Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.:11.843589222945432
She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on.:17.820482850696408
At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way!:14.636078869085754
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!:18.798937447907523
How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book!--When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library."  No one made any reply.:11.554856380025445
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day."  "Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball."  Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room.:10.61785529256395
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr.:19.75687204336004
Darcy looked up.:146.6281831227092
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.:14.799036318260809
He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing, that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere.:9.866954416558428
"What could he mean?:78.75867368839918
she was dying to know what could be his meaning"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?:13.16705621873403
"Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing about it."  Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr.:13.326171620999116
"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak.:13.117080506531533
"I never heard any thing so abominable.:26.814079799290194
How shall we punish him for such a speech?"  "Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth.:14.324075219742374
"We can all plague and punish one another.:15.127449213308067
Teaze him--laugh at him.--Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."  "But upon my honour I do _not_.:13.29937558761234
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_.:15.738456094415836
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind!:10.968915650270604
No, no--I feel he may defy us there.:20.071038710842686
Darcy may hug himself."  "Mr.:22.62181757471231
Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth.:21.892760631273628
I dearly love a laugh."  "Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be.:15.347597371245636
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good.:19.278878594129043
Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can.--But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without."  "Perhaps that is not possible for any one.:9.888656433849572
Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss Bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"  "I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr.:13.348169416600362
Darcy has no defect.:75.93916294096259
I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.:30.565780416988844
My temper I dare not vouch for.--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the convenience of the world.:11.548507721037687
I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself.:9.917533236234869
My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.:12.959887633123211
My temper would perhaps be called resentful.--My good opinion once lost is lost for ever."  "_That_ is a failing indeed!"--cried Elizabeth.:8.11684190894784
"Implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character.:19.008730207792002
But you have chosen your fault well.--I really cannot _laugh_ at it.:13.738927180446831
You are safe from me."  "There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."  "And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body."  "And yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand them."  "Do let us have a little music,"--cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share.--"Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr.:9.014219857709612
Hurst."  Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for it.:12.736901379666564
CHAPTER XII.:110.2249848057666
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day.:17.850861464694873
But Mrs.:262.69661697327405
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr.:16.08696090526549
Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well.--Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr.:9.299585896034698
Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.:13.480650671897564
The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred.:11.000247573431746
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.:14.534290608624286
Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough.:21.546112408959356
She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself.:14.449284823388867
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it.:8.682068535209499
Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.:11.647671984215137
On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place.:18.69935342973921
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.--Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits.:11.429512955425581
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.:14.288853126685076
Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.--But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.:13.361795059643187
The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.:16.447902182852776
They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to.:8.919024196747728
CHAPTER XIII.:126.15819532275205
Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party."  "Who do you mean, my dear?:13.409093481702095
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her.:11.469071007700144
It is Mr.:109.51085956252197
Bingley I am sure.:85.5720745539706
Why Jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing!:13.544373419070098
Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.:14.6540457379226
Bingley.--But--good lord!:27.571799726385237
how unlucky!:317.0679514361093
Lydia, my love, ring the bell.:25.73130854028141
I must speak to Hill, this moment."  "It is _not_ Mr.:20.132282069077363
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.:18.87898518299928
"About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention.:13.458441561745548
It is from my cousin, Mr.:35.60308614195084
Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."  "Oh!:13.07308123456285
my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.:15.308494040907252
Pray do not talk of that odious man.:26.490583285275804
I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it."  Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.:12.193776360930682
They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs.:17.948790782886658
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.:8.885054771079119
Bennet, "and nothing can clear Mr.:28.263705991808866
Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.:23.868982094735124
But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself."  "No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.:16.92704131306745
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?"  "Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear."       _Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,       15th October._       DEAR SIR,       The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured      father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the      misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the      breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing      lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good      terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at      variance.--"There, Mrs.:8.575371461295152
Bennet."--My mind however is now made up on      the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been      so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right      Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh,      whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable      rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to      demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be      ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are      instituted by the Church of England.:7.23262884706342
As a clergyman, moreover, I      feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in      all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds      I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly      commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the      entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,      and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch.:7.703806171498897
I cannot be      otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your      amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to      assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but      of this hereafter.:11.219602868400326
If you should have no objection to receive me      into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on      you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and      shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday      se'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as      Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a      Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the      duty of the day.:7.991560137465664
I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to      your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,       WILLIAM COLLINS."  "At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman," said Mr.:8.138238180451374
"He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again."  "There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him."  "Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit."  Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.:9.4047383652045
"He must be an oddity, I think," said she.:28.50239108211482
"I cannot make him out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he would help it, if he could.--Can he be a sensible man, sir?"  "No, my dear; I think not.:9.893010345321505
I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse.:17.740797759220943
There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well.:14.000067996622679
I am impatient to see him."  "In point of composition," said Mary, "his letter does not seem defective.:18.020821327543754
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed."  To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting.:10.275818487622722
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.:14.021771688475246
As for their mother, Mr.:55.371340737222106
Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family.:18.97478678866646
Bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr.:16.403082515746487
Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.:13.615721485549912
He was a tall, heavy looking young man of five and twenty.:14.522642864302094
His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal.:19.925022084024494
He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs.:16.850089393496845
Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.:11.241089151560457
Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,  "You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough.:10.778200024686925
Things are settled so oddly."  "You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate."  "Ah!:13.505829073639948
sir, I do indeed.:60.62817844676581
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess.:20.759702242398422
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed."  "I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate.:9.477574346127692
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them.:18.423619331816088
At present I will not say more, but perhaps when we are better acquainted----"  He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other.:13.927923440213311
They were not the only objects of Mr.:26.13931233581015
Collins's admiration.:68.98697716645464
Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.:18.204801313417665
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery was owing.:12.8116376604864
But here he was set right by Mrs.:23.495029705122075
Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.:17.129850578004902
He begged pardon for having displeased her.:25.16056887083647
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.:11.67094043210592
During dinner, Mr.:35.63502768998603
Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.:13.338685774214014
Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable.:13.525084502732694
Bennet could not have chosen better.:45.15175767314036
Collins was eloquent in her praise.:35.41966954233562
The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine.:10.636607309533847
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening.:12.171286629686946
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.:10.113991248206558
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations.:14.033266871666356
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.:8.799950600379008
"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs.:12.963207355372822
Bennet, "and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman.:20.298410909959017
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her.:16.241955014271706
Does she live near you, sir?"  "The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence."  "I think you said she was a widow, sir?:10.986705218222928
Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than many girls.:16.498271158186547
And what sort of young lady is she?:32.33787980197972
She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them.:8.933514201011809
But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."  "Has she been presented?:11.480398478499337
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies.:11.014086605388547
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her.--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay."  "You judge very properly," said Mr.:9.373355496016513
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?"  "They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible."  Mr.:7.947740850404675
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.:11.44224721245142
By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr.:16.03171865673514
Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.:13.26495362924886
Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with,  "Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard, and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.:10.150493838964563
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday.:22.872571147700544
I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr.:15.902720259993034
Denny comes back from town."  Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.:7.7724752751112725
Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,  "I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.:8.241036752784035
It amazes me, I confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction.:13.124367015053108
But I will no longer importune my young cousin."  Then turning to Mr.:10.76326228569821
Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.:9.303886818125198
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr.:13.367500297284998
Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.:39.76741788888333
Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance.:8.79532383351619
The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity.:10.173770573835709
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.:9.88086026193896
Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.:11.273239678555994
This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.:9.705069245770229
His plan did not vary on seeing them.--Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice.:10.155548472952486
The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tête-à-tête with Mrs.:11.013900583225686
Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.--"As to her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her _eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."  Mr.:10.36882747977034
Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon done--done while Mrs.:14.500176004350298
Bennet was stirring the fire.:34.155725039789516
Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.:14.034054523127029
Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces.:14.894870253834181
Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr.:24.35252126077691
Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr.:15.682548307617113
Collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.:11.214438201097657
Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.:18.915383374346053
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr.:12.027788554285603
Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr.:19.977361646573474
In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.:13.359045471250049
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recal them.:11.061770286704215
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way.:13.305167690120037
The officer was the very Mr.:71.33054461276832
Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed.:10.071943516085305
All were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot.:9.02904894816843
Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr.:11.112304004880043
Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps.:13.84434219476524
This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.:17.369954513238287
His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.:18.599429339558057
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.:7.778238836155025
On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities.:16.99707455314584
He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her.:22.681634593391774
Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.:13.67934551846246
Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red.:16.26962035295313
Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr.:8.580031963184366
Darcy just deigned to return.:45.3089065027969
What could be the meaning of it?--It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.:17.077382762958305
In another minute Mr.:61.29308919905806
Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.:12.37933183599622
Denny and Mr.:40.77679613545828
Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr.:23.964577893600666
Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.:12.423433613102246
Philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the invitation.:13.21054157654341
Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr.:12.056112233597034
Jones's shop boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr.:10.140162812267029
Collins by Jane's introduction of him.:27.90839245175916
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr.:8.570305505690989
Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the ----shire.:16.896919524540426
She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.:16.895689959126997
Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid, disagreeable fellows." Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.:9.635165001511512
Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening.:17.17222316008405
Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.:9.900520489561218
The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.:16.39492234412242
As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.:11.971403588910226
Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs.:25.61475981815944
Bennet by admiring Mrs.:42.229861448340976
He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before.:11.93933309244938
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.:18.02905176645617
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr.:20.080828802314983
Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr.:9.396583969653195
Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house.:23.428470075849066
When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.:14.547190850898646
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs.:10.26672399977265
Philips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room.:11.164509342557979
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.:11.451767998936678
Philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could.:11.920269850239148
To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.:12.962355192185598
The gentlemen did approach; and when Mr.:30.46784052432831
Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.:14.628605561183782
The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr.:15.657925525384986
Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.:9.907201115317635
Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.:8.668025143495875
With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr.:27.168591954201844
Wickham and the officers, Mr.:45.50922864955227
Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs.:9.787522854293787
Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.:12.55305519833874
When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her in return, by sitting down to whist.:13.164817578459893
"I know little of the game, at present," said he, "but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" Mrs.:15.55068426810147
Philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.:20.31656264276915
At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in particular.:8.898695657754912
Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr.:16.996035552645704
Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr.:15.22386903837283
She dared not even mention that gentleman.:28.639837405871106
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved.:28.770801710861754
Wickham began the subject himself.:60.8737023698331
Darcy had been staying there.:57.918845807983786
"About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand."  "Yes," replied Wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one.:11.953559058803723
A clear ten thousand per annum.:30.92846362904774
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."  Elizabeth could not but look surprised.:10.430347547848541
"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday.--Are you much acquainted with Mr.:11.394271266522178
Darcy?"  "As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth warmly,--"I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable."  "I have no right to give _my_ opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being agreeable or otherwise.:14.173403628169694
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.:18.53646583792012
It is impossible for _me_ to be impartial.:36.41640003403866
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else.--Here you are in your own family."  "Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.:11.021002696975936
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire.:35.70238077673957
Every body is disgusted with his pride.:27.868135231795105
You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one."  "I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen.:11.468002876217298
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen."  "I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man." Wickham only shook his head.:10.998242528182239
"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer."  "I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield.:16.076184347808532
I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."  "Oh!:15.242428840967698
no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr.:18.92770690270377
If _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go.:19.84997844910678
We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.:11.552998239265971
His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr.:36.15935929089384
Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections.:18.480215130394445
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father."  Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.:11.347285601889007
Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.:13.179203136995792
"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.:12.198721948506686
Society, I own, is necessary to me.:38.646792269836176
I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude.:20.75874575502113
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible.:20.932656652678997
Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift.:25.092719961538
He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.:24.282008664095212
I cannot do justice to his kindness.:37.036921809780516
He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere."  "Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be?--How could his will be disregarded?--Why did not you seek legal redress?"  "There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law.:10.524161694532195
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr.:18.88033062985507
Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.:9.52541025206798
Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it.:12.17550931795788
I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely.:13.455155643622941
But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me."  "This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced."  "Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_.:12.960204094384768
Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_."  Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.:11.432011045376559
"But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"  "A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy.:9.700427258628261
Had the late Mr.:54.992533945467336
Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life.:12.326937424155016
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of preference which was often given me."  "I had not thought Mr.:10.93817605438283
Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!"  After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, "I _do_ remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.:9.866703611062904
Philips, appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr.:14.382002725943616
Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property.:31.43098441992328
Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend.:26.8297833992012
Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance, and when immediately before my father's death, Mr.:12.975128724421925
Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself."  "How strange!" cried Elizabeth.:12.193625627455535
"How abominable!--I wonder that the very pride of this Mr.:24.898225876539193
Darcy has not made him just to you!--If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty I must call it."  "It _is_ wonderful,"--replied Wickham,--"for almost all his actions may be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend.:7.509458051399332
It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.:13.06939485982673
But we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger impulses even than pride."  "Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"  "Yes.:12.573158060921989
It has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor.:11.326149792176373
Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.:15.29148264484984
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy.:25.797141084523943
But she is too much like her brother,--very, very proud.--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.:12.749654068983236
But she is nothing to me now.:69.11107856992753
She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished.:15.087287251772578
Bingley!:3112.440737362469
How can Mr.:84.93242560278281
Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?:16.94433911725963
How can they suit each other?--Do you know Mr.:17.62519677199908
Bingley?"  "Not at all."  "He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man.:15.03093070718436
He cannot know what Mr.:50.920091882038065
Darcy is."  "Probably not;--but Mr.:23.726309421054342
Darcy can please where he chuses.:30.203607254673518
He does not want abilities.:50.86350495578836
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while.:15.533181551855098
Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.:16.610974631744305
His pride never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing something for fortune and figure."  The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and Mr.:8.118810337462492
Philips.--The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter.:20.33932012374781
Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy.:12.372389861687358
"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.:10.594340795524346
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters."  Mr.:9.780361756960923
Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr.:16.882606619931913
Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.:11.663696446626687
"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a living.:15.328112782993998
I hardly know how Mr.:48.48360896512898
Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long."  "You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr.:11.681214297917613
Darcy."  "No, indeed, I did not.--I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections.:19.322048657808608
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday."  "Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."  This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley.:13.224019658256617
Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined to another.:10.879672854713947
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class."  Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.:9.582136273096273
Wickham's attentions.:66.00469535972961
Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.:19.164404135049857
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.:42.35360415828686
She could think of nothing but of Mr.:27.07826137432014
Collins were once silent.:43.297041976246774
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won, and Mr.:13.827205097284068
Collins, in describing the civility of Mr.:19.095058191650388
Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.:9.299077624791787
CHAPTER XVII.:110.2249848057666
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr.:17.927191682396252
Wickham and herself.:90.19235492365716
Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she knew not how to believe that Mr.:12.05286462225155
Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.:30.191261808791246
Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.--The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be otherwise explained.:10.491310322905104
"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea.:14.507024275869759
Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other.:13.859837049818204
It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side."  "Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody."  "Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.:10.121738585867162
My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr.:12.474137150607172
Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--It is impossible.:14.031831533537124
No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.:18.046260019747688
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?:17.326023043049524
oh!:342.4436903211594
no."  "I can much more easily believe Mr.:25.59471485788939
Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr.:18.238534716768186
Darcy contradict it.:102.29297867692563
Besides, there was truth in his looks."  "It is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--One does not know what to think."  "I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think."  But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.:8.362661329068409
Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.:14.43964922157846
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr.:12.77317313881232
Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday.:15.326177357407946
To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs.:13.073074502303232
Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.:22.784018496325878
Bennet's civilities.:72.50752325737392
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family.:22.31229803162143
Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr.:11.977831564983644
Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card.:33.796080927357295
Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.:14.628876421871366
Darcy's looks and behaviour.:32.28267565009334
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia, depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr.:10.642172072182406
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it.:18.664241497254594
"While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough.--I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.:11.603593047375002
Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr.:14.667753976103414
Bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.:10.578857370925437
"I am by no means of opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her."  Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.:10.787853375288988
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances:--and to have Mr.:10.627020425948457
Collins instead!:304.44144369981046
her liveliness had been never worse timed.:33.09468930819417
There was no help for it however.:33.58256669276699
Wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer, and Mr.:13.463030624828965
Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.:13.891707064927017
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--It now first struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.:8.92314911315027
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_.:10.680893541963096
Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply.:14.177816339431496
Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.:15.88085327126062
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.:13.232207673189356
No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy.:9.312932601107697
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr.:11.078262304054654
Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia.:9.335443596048485
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr.:12.020099540356604
Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.:11.662591743923063
She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening.:13.471595499437205
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr.:10.904398035742753
Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr.:15.070610538069584
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr.:13.535471305995586
Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.:19.6173645763762
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.:12.905726842966118
The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification.:11.956073735075242
Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.:8.636532298742338
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr.:12.225138037437212
Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him.:19.707891128839098
He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her.:11.789961706547107
"I dare say you will find him very agreeable."  "Heaven forbid!--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me such an evil."  When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.:8.772685811189163
Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr.:11.595652048460314
Darcy, and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.:11.244993195435473
They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance.:11.257581214090775
He replied, and was again silent.:51.65541719372633
Darcy.--_I_ talked about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples."  He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.:13.58213658656367
One must speak a little, you know.:41.7672652056635
"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.--_You_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."  "I must not decide on my own performance."  He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton.:11.505386095614671
She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance."  The effect was immediate.:11.464137940519176
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on.:14.209856995519399
At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said,  "Mr.:19.46520098438542
Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is less certain."  "He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied Elizabeth with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life."  Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.:9.88929256509151
Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.:10.619687150300706
"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir.:21.147136597523396
Such very superior dancing is not often seen.:28.09036935125971
It is evident that you belong to the first circles.:35.66647827965768
Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place.:9.633004825932048
I appeal to Mr.:59.98014983292501
Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, Sir.--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."  The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.:9.12119047257551
Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said,  "Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."  "I do not think we were speaking at all.:11.622510859099284
Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.--We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine."  "What think you of books?" said he, smiling.:10.092346745474323
no.--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings."  "I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions."  "No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else."  "The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?" said he, with a look of doubt.:9.80630657048279
"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr.:12.611441493218754
Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable.:12.431805061561096
You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being created_."  "I am," said he, with a firm voice.:13.719350739838552
"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"  "I hope not."  "It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first."  "May I ask to what these questions tend?"  "Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity.:9.062275371985363
"I am trying to make it out."  "And what is your success?"  She shook her head.:12.88729805010184
"I do not get on at all.:24.123530578497906
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."  "I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."  "But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity."  "I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied.:8.890063529878935
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.:10.46546554578084
Darcy's steward.:64.51458154230457
Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr.:17.032721849570446
Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr.:12.490498587697163
I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr.:18.567738097429796
Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.:14.026919104855725
His coming into the country at all, is a most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.:18.352466617448798
I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better."  "His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr.:11.46753747389572
Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself."  "I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.:13.45125663280652
"Excuse my interference.--It was kindly meant."  "Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself.--"You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.:11.491144695462703
I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.:15.362425580278995
Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley.:15.847217327466774
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.:10.154875861993006
"I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr.:14.570891027171694
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon."  "No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you.:12.437501891852788
Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr.:15.870725053748995
Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr.:20.05823184062095
Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr.:13.787155923618135
I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr.:15.981818715583751
Darcy's regard."  "Mr.:29.017339043345096
Bingley does not know Mr.:48.2640409377675
Wickham himself?"  "No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton."  "This account then is what he has received from Mr.:14.708742226943261
I am perfectly satisfied.:66.70004431001318
But what does he say of the living?"  "He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr.:15.011992227439558
Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only."  "I have not a doubt of Mr.:14.723169181693663
Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly; "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.:11.608558168263574
Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before."  She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment.:10.778199273115408
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it.:11.966447735521294
On their being joined by Mr.:30.437567912761004
Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr.:14.625673491950426
"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness.:14.328980948029821
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine.:12.27498634719987
How wonderfully these sort of things occur!:22.662326978300023
Who would have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly!--I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.:9.786426534534167
Darcy?"  "Indeed I am.:67.25571998489127
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.:14.114218559338854
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night."  Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that Mr.:10.358307066750966
Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr.:9.891623835272433
Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance.--Mr.:19.944846675334816
Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus,  "My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained.:8.931002202876218
You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty.:12.69752469145318
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself." And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.:7.361296096112024
Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology," "Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh."--It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man.:10.429801509045117
Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr.:17.24065130310678
Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.:15.01502795700501
Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr.:17.03291354686556
Collins then returned to Elizabeth.:56.01752792673102
"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my reception.:15.962746659539908
Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.:35.84604451004489
He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.:12.74807108132071
It was really a very handsome thought.:36.41197575876933
Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."  As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr.:13.27455665218222
Bingley, and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane.:10.006150809760014
She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters.:11.154825834004587
Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much.:11.092301181978156
Bingley.--It was an animating subject, and Mrs.:26.644053162635032
His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do.:14.057930213039782
It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.:12.219952820084332
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.:10.849518137485177
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.:17.017921124915826
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.:10.706814120639681
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr.:11.345195293868167
Darcy, who sat opposite to them.:29.491084548482235
Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.:23.937547355061376
"What is Mr.:88.33725359569638
Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?:33.025979985308226
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.:25.94289488231186
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.:13.341006557904205
The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.:11.849289284310535
At length however Mrs.:48.41490940260866
Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.:10.755561690653808
Elizabeth now began to revive.:53.03802577307305
But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company.:10.147620270760536
By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.:8.937267346534702
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected.--Elizabeth was in agonies.:11.932297414722322
She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however impenetrably grave.:11.897480612252085
She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night.:11.872609297741372
You have delighted us long enough.:32.39883143629626
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."  Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to.:12.896858479970074
"If I," said Mr.:42.90168782580964
Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.:11.337628634052939
He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible.:12.06197068721414
And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.:9.278393660661212
I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family." And with a bow to Mr.:9.908183141728996
Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--Many stared.--Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.:9.961707742617676
Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr.:25.343503021921332
Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.:12.780114625115315
To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.:12.189151565520437
That his two sisters and Mr.:38.902130404015885
Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.:12.871839670404572
She was teazed by Mr.:34.082268114377385
Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others.:15.511852830455492
He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening.:13.96155630609829
There was no arguing upon such a project.:26.687102227292527
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr.:13.816712137031407
Collins's conversation to herself.:31.4712594042532
She was at least free from the offence of Mr.:23.46769408947756
Darcy's farther notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.:12.772405933163046
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr.:19.9752385725542
Wickham, and rejoiced in it.:48.38509530702464
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manoeuvre of Mrs.:18.188766782565537
Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family.:11.394272576819809
Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.:10.4031506154424
They repulsed every attempt of Mrs.:23.49257684701256
Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr.:12.016267171574592
Collins, who was complimenting Mr.:26.465833843626992
Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.:13.704948914008712
Darcy said nothing at all.:52.73432242988429
Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.:28.74316623137193
Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other.:19.38635549012783
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs.:12.035565313678914
Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord, how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn.:9.835336321749391
When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs.:15.388399453897291
Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr.:11.956853361742152
Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.:12.436275939119037
Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four months.:9.647071773699254
Of having another daughter married to Mr.:26.003236177590622
Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.:16.80203380704192
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr.:13.536144723692926
Bingley and Netherfield.:119.35723236918403
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.:18.506597810923576
On finding Mrs.:108.82301532025905
Bennet instantly answered,  "Oh dear!--Yes--certainly.--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection.--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs." And gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out,  "Dear Ma'am, do not go.--I beg you will not go.--Mr.:10.218160297620422
Collins must excuse me.--He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear.:18.514193625408453
Collins."  Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion.:10.132954391971106
Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone Mr.:19.631347600826132
Collins began.:302.4385289173925
"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.:12.474586828576198
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother's permission for this address.:10.112491771069703
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.:9.768222445371302
Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life.:12.298660203272897
Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued:  "My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish.:7.934535279488973
Secondly, that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.:9.655397622175867
Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr.:10.106947876070887
Collins, you must marry.:54.3561510610373
A clergyman like you must marry.--Chuse properly, chuse a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way.:8.435233931375734
This is my advice.:75.85722985141287
Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer.:11.865938723539628
Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I assure you there are many amiable young women.:8.915745587033602
But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years.:10.884998889659112
This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.:15.82247630186891
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection.:17.558222016239085
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents.:14.405710993385853
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.:17.55761179344717
On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."  It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.:8.704255244370145
"You are too hasty, Sir," she cried.:20.39949548371731
"You forget that I have made no answer.:32.51587314411175
Let me do it without farther loss of time.:16.62911809123752
Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me.:20.682210824434783
Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time.:9.198685369649244
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."  "Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration.:9.406737661071677
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time.:9.970722941777959
I am perfectly serious in my refusal.--You could not make _me_ happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so.--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation."  "Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr.:11.045917642704195
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualifications."  "Indeed, Mr.:14.402868220137224
You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say.:15.219426458728627
I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.:12.248869315977108
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.:11.29413290227676
This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled." And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr.:15.525024648925356
Collins thus addressed her,  "When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character."  "Really, Mr.:10.856528553317888
Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me exceedingly.:19.297771063849094
My reasons for believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable.:8.675674895797489
My situation in life, my connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.:10.629602174261892
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.:9.369388941429422
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."  "I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.:8.809000270040848
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.:15.15893525466799
My feelings in every respect forbid it.:26.08870240703203
Can I speak plainer?:47.71718753054638
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart."  "You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable."  To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.:8.614939653197755
CHAPTER XX.:158.8817295243088
Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs.:18.256409474456824
Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.:9.020080183289654
Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.:9.55008484174167
This information, however, startled Mrs.:27.943638733492886
"But depend upon it, Mr.:27.0737054674727
Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall be brought to reason.:16.293247098220274
I will speak to her about it myself directly.:35.164268924416405
She is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will _make_ her know it."  "Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam," cried Mr.:14.140372222774461
Collins; "but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.:14.162243192346006
If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."  "Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs.:9.46453154921414
Bennet, alarmed.:118.91158801502928
"Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.:19.093381034639116
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived.:17.953697031210243
I will go directly to Mr.:32.920850356119175
Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.:23.393444563960408
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr.:19.557203394597977
Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication.:14.705784120195101
"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had finished her speech.:14.061761580193245
"Of what are you talking?"  "Of Mr.:33.44112483599848
Collins and Lizzy.:108.78711431338404
Lizzy declares she will not have Mr.:30.82097193436599
Collins, and Mr.:57.39879019791502
Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy."  "And what am I to do on the occasion?--It seems an hopeless business."  "Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.:12.903012884468515
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him."  "Let her be called down.:14.773864208363197
She shall hear my opinion."  Mrs.:25.59847416950729
Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.:25.990696023158886
"I have sent for you on an affair of importance.:19.40732084013649
I understand that Mr.:74.51143229283984
Collins has made you an offer of marriage.:17.917766360632623
Is it true?" Elizabeth replied that it was.:28.46865672352597
"Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?"  "I have, Sir."  "Very well.:16.98549635324544
We now come to the point.:54.4432956553163
Your mother insists upon your accepting it.:16.73944549536433
Is not it so, Mrs.:43.262864742354
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents.--Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr.:11.182712071800097
Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_."  Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but Mrs.:13.284623688625448
Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.:16.142198066306253
"What do you mean, Mr.:24.81757353007434
Bennet, by talking in this way?:41.7747579296936
You promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him."  "My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to request.:11.752398701833922
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room.:21.09392152878417
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be."  Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs.:15.534714636392557
Bennet give up the point.:58.39639501751545
She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.:11.955970292466437
Though her manner varied however, her determination never did.:21.225405142310546
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way.:11.178604133295122
His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.:15.269362072691345
While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them.:18.434378778094093
Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him."  Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs.:14.475510445686592
Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family.:13.130018905759835
"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves."  Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.:9.805515293936857
"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs.:19.78058757635776
I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children.--Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body.:10.573146295037377
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking.:10.816533867367646
Nobody can tell what I suffer!--But it is always so.:20.087331283752704
Those who do not complain are never pitied."  Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.:6.644163211131457
She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr.:19.266403437759013
Collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,  "Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let Mr.:15.480939682555517
Collins and me have a little conversation together."  Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr.:11.879643875236315
Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear.:13.380304174641068
Bennet thus began the projected conversation.--"Oh!:15.414546711506972
Collins!"--  "My dear Madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point.:14.945410710557761
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.:7.726158866985549
You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr.:9.870288113977612
Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.:12.136130462866442
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own.:10.111074649364213
But we are all liable to error.:28.068353323242565
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."     CHAPTER XXI.:11.943773044095948
The discussion of Mr.:69.50580383723585
Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.:11.23647001039465
As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence.:9.774389936006974
He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.:14.995253865528356
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs.:18.85217014377001
Bennet's ill humour or ill health.:17.590322045870327
Collins was also in the same state of angry pride.:22.74353036666784
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr.:15.911106312906973
Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.:19.935834033096
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked over.--To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed.:10.404597878469456
"I found," said he, "as the time drew near, that I had better not meet Mr.:16.81931257316078
His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.:13.029289258637746
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and was opened immediately.:16.080970665414384
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.:9.25807188162218
Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs.:9.762314617906435
When they had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,  "This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a good deal.:11.589446145254506
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.:14.029466854994455
Hurst had a house.:76.37728541943218
"I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence.:9.718798178161295
I depend on you for that." To these high flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr.:9.613365883168282
Bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.:16.979647688351587
"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country.:13.067681239231277
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?--Mr.:9.490269915887719
Bingley will not be detained in London by them."  "Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter.:11.72639772665526
I will read it to you--  "When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.:10.82282653558794
Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I despair.:15.399626269805951
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of whom we shall deprive you."  "It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this winter."  "It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_."  "Why will you think so?:10.143547133894526
It must be his own doing.--He is his own master.:32.6868405679039
But you do not know _all_.:48.74844590742967
I _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me.:11.904772186946696
I will have no reserves from _you_." "Mr.:21.41035580197528
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister.:9.247104217290824
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable.:11.355024901140837
My brother admires her greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart.:10.199486146838021
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?"  "What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?"--said Jane as she finished it.:10.043953120512388
"Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard?:9.606002441642245
Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"  "Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--Will you hear it?"  "Most willingly."  "You shall have it in few words.:10.986936474375888
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.:19.481421375864763
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you."  Jane shook her head.:15.28607134504751
"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.--No one who has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection.:17.026816029970927
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot.:37.992610424133574
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.:22.33196060941113
Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.:24.648036405522717
But the case is this.:74.3028261609416
We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.:11.067835397634378
But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."  "If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your representation of all this, might make me quite easy.:11.092282359043745
But I know the foundation is unjust.:37.83676890684363
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself."  "That is right.--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine.:10.045119180409491
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."  "But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?"  "You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth, "and if upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him."  "How can you talk so?"--said Jane faintly smiling,--"You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate."  "I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion."  "But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required.:9.363510885114195
A thousand things may arise in six months!"  The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt.:10.217907691050272
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.:13.6928748424031
They agreed that Mrs.:56.2419337940992
Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together.:10.921977315230908
After lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that Mr.:12.72300272820246
Collins.:1986.7687535781179
"It keeps him in good humour," said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express." Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.:12.873282075704667
This was very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her from any return of Mr.:11.040427237810835
Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself.:16.313246901819596
Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.:11.778914812962197
But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet.:11.642485369139514
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.:9.991280647460604
His reception however was of the most flattering kind.:30.366488103067244
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.:12.780236125471747
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.:12.934836282202568
Collins's long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness.:12.325400369589595
The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.:8.552977089525516
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.:11.13681054010824
Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair.:10.895191130736563
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr.:10.965809202094695
Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr.:19.229354760120618
The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid.:8.40126070681374
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed.:23.094529094958467
She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it.:22.976419578664153
Her reflections were in general satisfactory.:53.9163833027597
Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary.:12.567431133891338
But still he would be her husband.--Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want.:7.957298521056889
This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.:13.000240446462191
The least agreeable circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person.:15.511075987572534
Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation.:14.736839680075924
She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr.:25.069390063534456
Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.:14.699008669085591
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.:8.561702263359177
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs.:12.339947921459919
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.:11.817185592264732
"My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible."  They were all astonished; and Mr.:12.835395089589843
Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said,  "But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir?--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of offending your patroness."  "My dear sir," replied Mr.:8.764926085623765
Collins, "I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."  "You cannot be too much on your guard.:10.345546352885151
As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth."  With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.:8.131263582720877
Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.:14.856146487528175
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very agreeable companion.:10.149764641434281
But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away.:22.53051471519016
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.:14.806211673763036
The possibility of Mr.:70.76099930707768
Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,  "Engaged to Mr.:10.57590482058006
Collins!:2431.105097033135
my dear Charlotte,--impossible!"  The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied,  "Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible that Mr.:8.369050613644456
Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"  But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.:12.339625777800192
Collins was wishing to marry you.:31.589033912281444
But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done.:23.280438526584927
I am not romantic you know.:32.09946561895893
I never was.:165.5771934290173
I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr.:23.695048485831368
Collins's character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on entering the marriage state."  Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.:9.941428584247957
Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.:18.33394783988965
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match.:16.652845291453257
The strangeness of Mr.:64.96472563349076
Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted.:11.357023573291084
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.:10.528741456463708
Collins, was a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.:12.636057709065147
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family.:10.889956560658867
Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,  "Good Lord!:10.20453150569435
Sir William, how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know that Mr.:16.423897912075784
Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"  Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.:10.327880542829043
Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr.:10.139668207848311
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent.:10.688173105587891
In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr.:14.72099110108648
Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.:15.576875589547502
Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.:12.08614749748254
Nothing could console and nothing appease her.--Nor did that day wear out her resentment.:8.386117830353806
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.:11.2279412209368
Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!:13.682912782600608
Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr.:13.741852994547108
Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.:13.529840667069381
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs.:11.698358719368315
Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs.:13.31474130585837
Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.:12.206885197596197
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again.:9.154807895840232
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.:12.476992860411068
The promised letter of thanks from Mr.:22.96837741378663
Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted.:13.821908826592898
After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.:9.307679834618183
Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs.:13.077300002007895
Bennet.:1384.120010805932
Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs.:17.886788626696
Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr.:20.62366515912406
Bingley's continued absence.:38.94372149566868
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.:12.524248310425353
Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.:9.981282435899507
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.:18.33114371293056
Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.:13.155243968520256
Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring.:11.620152193399107
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.:15.689321753406658
As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to.:13.730768995458902
But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back, she should think herself very ill used.:11.86943067842335
It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.:10.103333274554418
Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction.:14.12086476188359
He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company.:15.500711453373599
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.:14.211964940686002
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.:38.46615015073059
The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her.:31.725511332158277
As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence.:20.355694194500288
Whenever Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr.:10.568565904045018
Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr.:18.614867175397066
She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.:37.26280648511239
"Indeed, Mr.:62.48019773507095
Let us hope for better things.:16.856114370048576
Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor."  This was not very consoling to Mrs.:9.522675674311298
Bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before,  "I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.:17.83138193411252
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr.:11.757127831724894
Collins too!--Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?"  "I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr.:11.317276947106915
END OF VOL.:54.18824813675849
[Illustration: A VICARAGE HOUSE.]     PRIDE AND PREJUDICE:  A Novel.:5.512273665028861
PRIDE & PREJUDICE.:48.65924017033355
Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.:18.65781166558291
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort.:12.604749306269797
Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it.:15.818588478688518
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr.:15.697590283112813
Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.:11.345054607784023
Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation.:13.963447564175626
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all the others.:19.20314615353791
To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit.:15.854725142198633
Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself.:13.36819834390412
It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.:21.49711795978039
She could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.:9.826458205837262
Bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying,  "Oh!:10.289825803514079
that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.:12.996864409718738
But I will not repine.:56.27923907648712
It cannot last long.:67.13139923868259
He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before."  Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.:15.708559218917285
"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no reason.:18.534339244328674
I have not _that_ pain.:41.830879951783785
Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you.:13.05823931812183
I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve."  Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection.:10.69298427407608
"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair.:25.387821379408326
_You_ wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body.:20.977062688217426
_I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.:14.130334042220214
Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will.:11.01042802580244
You need not.:172.78655766572876
There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well.:16.925190435177036
The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense.:13.601045257475269
I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's marriage.:14.268253684826087
It is unaccountable!:132.35984624919433
They will ruin your happiness.:31.418100795548852
Consider Mr.:142.58272200245386
Collins's respectability, and Charlotte's prudent, steady character.:19.791606241102446
Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin."  "To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding, than I now do of her heart.:12.923396007069242
My dear Jane, Mr.:40.91450256384448
Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him, cannot have a proper way of thinking.:12.037892484005647
You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas.:33.6809958818986
You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger, security for happiness."  "I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied Jane, "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together.:9.15342753155403
But enough of this.:149.48647972744394
You mentioned _two_ instances.:61.59620856352405
I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk.:12.872747486216303
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect.:16.42558625621133
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us.:13.158343380807233
Women fancy admiration means more than it does."  "And men take care that they should."  "If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."  "I am far from attributing any part of Mr.:10.348976169150976
But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem.:15.054578604883238
Stop me whilst you can."  "You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him."  "Yes, in conjunction with his friend."  "I cannot believe it.:11.836029135598215
They can only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it."  "Your first position is false.:12.396453058545037
They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better.:10.664623850615929
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?:14.394340045493093
If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.:15.399798356672717
By supposing such an affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy.:15.902049390302066
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.:13.343639198988864
Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."  Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr.:16.34789640505274
Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.:16.150643198226742
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity.:10.071285209362594
Bennet's best comfort was, that Mr.:20.717525515873433
Bingley must be down again in the summer.:43.83650931635176
Bennet treated the matter differently.:49.05119023716051
"So, Lizzy," said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love I find.:18.27797210091408
Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.:18.240577351471646
It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions.:19.896679655841506
You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane.:24.706435677534138
Now is your time.:92.24596791726202
Let Wickham be _your_ man.:26.491905879012144
He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."  "Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.:13.570215903489101
We must not all expect Jane's good fortune."  "True," said Mr.:16.426892792742574
Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it."  Mr.:12.48740651888235
Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr.:12.620242599569162
Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.:23.361124846377482
Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday.:15.818997745484252
The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.:12.897479943067243
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.:10.258295543031517
On the following Monday, Mrs.:27.65300350451156
Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn.:13.93482978356423
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred and agreeable.:14.023953329928139
Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs.:14.348461048507229
Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.:16.776108716024755
Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.:15.447763190567358
They had frequently been staying with her in town.:28.73469718702654
The first part of Mrs.:62.002596415917345
Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.:19.45715516781538
They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.:13.85670073938929
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.:22.625513900158076
"I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got Mr.:16.47145778401789
Bingley, if she could.:83.21380034131595
But, Lizzy!:159.8418301995292
Oh, sister!:99.81707609099877
it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr.:24.62832814347954
Collins's wife by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness.:20.31326278914804
He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him.:20.801349121610528
The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever.:18.30466260867376
They are all for what they can get.:36.452317529435646
It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else.:12.182206555039803
However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves."  Mrs.:11.631999220424468
Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation.:14.781497330491998
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.:21.67195796756398
"I am sorry it went off.:21.380788041353355
But these things happen so often!:34.20461680811841
A young man, such as you describe Mr.:29.38464672174408
Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent."  "An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not do for _us_.:11.093293345060205
We do not suffer by _accident_.:27.97653139896705
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love with only a few days before."  "But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.:9.56423779123109
It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.:13.879930350708474
Pray, how _violent was_ Mr.:17.460709084635468
Bingley's love?"  "I never saw a more promising inclination.:17.28096311058825
He was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.:16.57137629943329
Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable.:18.211834861131265
At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.:13.1371029380906
Could there be finer symptoms?:31.58510504302529
Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"  "Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.:13.383471947502349
Poor Jane!:151.56271816717214
It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.:17.14531908715596
But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us?:21.807242256933286
Change of scene might be of service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as anything."  Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.:10.840999152069829
"I hope," added Mrs.:41.12415165110239
Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her.:14.647924816442828
We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her."  "And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr.:11.910682805319981
Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London!:22.31112524166461
My dear aunt, how could you think of it?:32.500318680314166
Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr.:9.733418480106284
I hope they will not meet at all.:37.77262757984958
But does not Jane correspond with the sister?:41.21854237733549
_She_ will not be able to help calling."  "She will drop the acquaintance entirely."  But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless.:10.40287201735206
It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions.:14.884914053112135
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.:14.20429045951695
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement.:16.976116375384663
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner.:15.45846521172259
Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.:10.222841139955047
To Mrs.:288.5505786403587
About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire, to which he belonged.:13.557411194946893
They had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had been in the way of procuring.:13.318313771570613
Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr.:23.183431931657147
Darcy by character perfectly well.:36.372591590093414
Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse.:17.074194507491868
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley, with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself.:9.591986765504762
On being made acquainted with the present Mr.:32.60854758665355
Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard Mr.:10.876485154965973
Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.:12.928913325680226
Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:  "You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly.:10.22433046012106
I have nothing to say against _him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better.:16.108232269480396
But as it is--you must not let your fancy run away with you.:18.79591799542251
You have sense, and we all expect you to use it.:25.743795281843607
Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct, I am sure.:14.869516778717307
I will take care of myself, and of Mr.:27.871129726384506
Wickham too.:304.13372616709654
He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it."  "Elizabeth, you are not serious now."  "I beg your pardon.:18.380584620783896
I will try again.:68.01630841549624
At present I am not in love with Mr.:29.86605758595895
But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to me--I believe it will be better that he should not.:14.629715315040054
I see the imprudence of it.--Oh!:34.79725503346791
_that_ abominable Mr.:54.33925136985015
Darcy!--My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it.:13.36323245935934
My father, however, is partial to Mr.:29.474835105513538
In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist?:9.636690542167461
All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry.:31.681156344998357
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object.:19.911422293097502
When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.:25.456552008928593
In short, I will do my best."  "Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very often.:17.50709267421113
At least, you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him."  "As I did the other day," said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_.:12.380031243425103
But do not imagine that he is always here so often.:30.17796739568559
But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you are satisfied."  Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented.:13.877805465502815
Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.:13.765427112066316
His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she "_wished_ they might be happy." Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room.:10.74954832638328
As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,  "I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza."  "_That_ you certainly shall."  "And I have another favour to ask.:12.287654249962035
Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford."  Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.:15.565246531124249
"My father and Maria are to come to me in March," added Charlotte, "and I hope you will consent to be of the party.:16.764959394464775
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible.:13.617469773667775
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was.:12.523552712923221
She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise.:13.923051724679397
The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging.:16.959671011780458
Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there, to know the rest.:14.989163403114235
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.:14.539514215479462
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is.:14.064956206724496
Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or hearing from Caroline.:15.684396734254728
She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been lost.:19.672219174394275
"My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street."  She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.:12.419474663768368
"I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London.:13.019178909562408
I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.:17.53829783078107
I enquired after their brother, of course.:43.85381568886463
He was well, but so much engaged with Mr.:35.65887583878625
Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him.:36.49188818094528
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner.:40.73739083417376
I wish I could see her.:60.605625941399815
My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs.:32.89367013645782
Hurst were going out.:38.96967597513039
I dare say I shall soon see them here."  Elizabeth shook her head over this letter.:12.35354452025437
It convinced her, that accident only could discover to Mr.:18.82077948220713
Bingley her sister's being in town.:30.181005589105617
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer.:13.368024696546172
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will prove what she felt.:24.804010429377183
"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in      her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have      been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me.:11.23482439904283
But, my      dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me      obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour      was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.:10.54362621181629
I do not at      all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but      if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should      be deceived again.:14.244972631190057
When      she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;      she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said      not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so      altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly      resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.:12.70738392988147
I pity, though I      cannot help blaming her.:31.03090279783208
She was very wrong in singling me out as      she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on      her side.:12.4119250373731
But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been      acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her      brother is the cause of it.:18.481429684757064
I cannot but wonder,      however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at      all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.:15.211299080314108
He knows of my      being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and      yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to      persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy.:14.793546717048423
I cannot      understand it.:76.18937884214972
If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should      be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of      duplicity in all this.:12.579172169423682
But I will endeavour to banish every painful      thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,      and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.:14.490866938860432
Miss Bingley said something of his never      returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not      with any certainty.:17.75463613638558
We had better not mention it.:36.31905225443888
I am extremely      glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at      Hunsford.:12.58276060570713
I am      sure you will be very comfortable there.:25.452903880989258
"Your's, &c."  This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.:11.057606119359342
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.:28.334054966013984
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions.:27.119687344076087
Darcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.:19.22302572850672
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.:12.018557031836107
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.:10.107662655218194
All this was acknowledged to Mrs.:35.48281072041294
Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on:--"I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.:9.923873606217393
But my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King.:11.726686680232602
I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl.:17.999991568226143
There can be no love in all this.:28.75316460129622
My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.:13.394191379390017
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.:12.133331506895365
Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.:13.626730766088937
They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the plain."     CHAPTER IV.:12.948909535546385
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away.:8.097102690527693
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford.:28.75277514776826
Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr.:9.93835185589198
There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake.:14.002316285624918
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.:25.8604978267213
The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.:12.38447727359266
The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.:17.24423247642675
The farewell between herself and Mr.:34.96996597260614
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.:10.227070683608002
Her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable.:16.317672627756618
Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise.:12.00021741909279
Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William's too long.:20.83111139456194
As they drove to Mr.:35.86672561942308
On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.:10.100065505403022
All was joy and kindness.:40.68784723659525
The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.:14.144112474271365
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.:30.964953221502682
It was reasonable, however, to hope, that they would not continue long.:24.730575322122597
Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.:11.24016486022134
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.:11.336480717897837
"But, my dear Elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is Miss King?:15.817742064058569
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."  "Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?:11.214499579793383
Where does discretion end, and avarice begin?:23.204072906796632
Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary."  "If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think."  "She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.:12.910853373505697
I know no harm of her."  "But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune."  "No--why should he?:12.344552618474687
If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?"  "But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this event."  "A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe.:9.615013901813912
It only shews her being deficient in something herself--sense or feeling."  "Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose.:11.444465025972798
_He_ shall be mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish."  "No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose.:17.74311659768647
I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire."  "Oh!:13.918066574574432
if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better.:15.65797735887287
I am sick of them all.:50.87526795161795
Thank Heaven!:85.07795680321405
Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all."  "Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."  Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.:9.414594536491622
"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs.:12.478014155190921
"My dear, dear aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight!:16.971445776443534
what felicity!:413.3850955960139
You give me fresh life and vigour.:21.89023908984967
Adieu to disappointment and spleen.:14.221870273395995
What are men to rocks and mountains?:15.270561885277099
what hours of transport we shall spend!:27.503881577164897
We _will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.:13.439152815133284
Lakes, mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation.:7.285408201512395
Let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."     CHAPTER V.:7.727883818872764
Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.:11.51849164777544
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.:12.965749037545265
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side.:14.673596804657084
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.:27.002247353460383
At length the Parsonage was discernible.:27.869213216260544
The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every thing declared they were arriving.:15.943463765038565
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received.:14.86358537578973
She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family.:10.856769544228202
They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.:11.175294638603166
But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion.:10.810885493073172
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear.:11.363223260856268
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London, Mr.:12.683586231218003
Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind.:6.1969770899079455
He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.:13.236277552550831
It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.:12.833318716875041
From his garden, Mr.:34.50843769740856
Collins would have led them round his two meadows, but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help.:9.316709196396895
It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.:10.163514596034222
Collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.:14.10831549430505
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.:24.108844380770474
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr.:17.611895715010828
Collins joining in, observed,  "Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her.:13.524678682628027
She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over.:13.646151676491336
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.:10.113112052172658
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming.:46.395356019733356
We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home.:15.361080731097081
Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.:15.779094570004267
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."  The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well.:9.781651290167575
She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr.:8.549526583380642
Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings.:21.263155663680134
A lively imagination soon settled it all.:26.115546426317934
About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.:11.948138056208673
She opened the door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out,  "Oh, my dear Eliza!:14.40904255960647
pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen!:15.26485821242824
I will not tell you what it is.:54.60407461839914
Make haste, and come down this moment."  Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.:9.982827275141277
"I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter!"  "La!:16.47191766577966
my dear," said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady Catherine.:17.3420850768398
Jenkinson, who lives with them.:26.24174567097445
The other is Miss De Bourgh.:40.42317655827731
Only look at her.:84.69082808902068
She is quite a little creature.:67.95993923742081
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!"  "She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.:11.37561603338201
Why does she not come in?"  "Oh!:18.388487042430643
Charlotte says, she hardly ever does.:36.066978435074205
It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in."  "I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.:10.47362388888536
"She looks sickly and cross.--Yes, she will do for him very well.:18.03097928336369
She will make him a very proper wife."  Mr.:27.968592525983805
Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way.:12.084825810319977
At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house.:19.369048768170515
Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.:9.224157735626584
Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete.:18.11700684174599
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.:11.254282441546291
"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings.:11.993886948401078
I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen.:27.0488464074449
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?:25.552827598985903
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!"  "I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William, "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.:8.223179507577084
About the Court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."  Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but their visit to Rosings.:10.899847911187944
Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.:12.426409208723022
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which becomes herself and daughter.:9.5800211763386
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion for any thing more.:13.014477272209792
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed.:18.339976499390872
As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park.--Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr.:9.800678980482036
Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh.:8.628707070322932
When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.--Elizabeth's courage did not fail her.:11.172032763280374
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she thought she could witness without trepidation.:9.125101076954058
From the entrance hall, of which Mr.:28.626882658111953
Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs.:10.40588844720602
Jenkinson were sitting.--Her Ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs.:11.697582384358071
Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.:14.812165084706955
In spite of having been at St.:33.85334639765905
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.--Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.:11.198242408729158
Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank.:15.546942757555776
She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr.:12.878448563439907
Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.:21.121004867965347
When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr.:11.902205658774884
Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment, at her being so thin, and so small.:16.937239238613984
There was neither in figure nor face, any likeness between the ladies.:13.48575931162334
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs.:10.605647072228242
Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.:11.826035513638306
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows, to admire the view, Mr.:13.449453922981618
Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.:13.048075950489542
Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater.--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.:9.850760604372995
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them.:9.526988963042568
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time.:11.132611711331561
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she were indisposed.:8.875294761838724
Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.:14.311977195791485
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted.:10.661795816276832
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others.:12.101026403089104
In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs.:25.681829039985978
Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs.:13.637149891662512
Collins, I think.:127.58663897016807
For your sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family.--Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?"  "A little."  "Oh!:9.040618485501453
then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.:20.388280028480164
Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it some day.--Do your sisters play and sing?"  "One of them does."  "Why did not you all learn?--You ought all to have learned.:9.196617582669543
The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as your's.--Do you draw?"  "No, not at all."  "What, none of you?"  "Not one."  "That is very strange.:13.900971486986634
But I suppose you had no opportunity.:47.431702595783385
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education."  Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case.:15.147750286725831
"Then, who taught you?:66.523290926504
who attended to you?:108.78627323279932
Without a governess you must have been neglected."  "Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn, never wanted the means.:12.22662495978229
We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.:18.054215759696916
Those who chose to be idle, certainly might."  "Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one.:11.42852896367242
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.:11.660295134665922
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way.:13.721241754548116
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out.:17.237637986793214
Four nieces of Mrs.:32.68984035711595
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her.:11.244870165856899
Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me?:13.459483040688903
She finds Miss Pope a treasure.:20.93337084551416
Very odd!--And you only the second.--The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your younger sisters must be very young?"  "Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.:11.936885664001316
Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company.:19.829208587019203
But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth, as the first.:10.347600639973443
And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind."  "Upon my word," said her Ladyship, "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.--Pray, what is your age?"  "With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth smiling, "your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."  Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.:8.56856568800778
"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age."  "I am not one and twenty."  When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed.:10.40553818535309
Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr.:24.38134489966431
Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs.:11.246774958615358
Jenkinson to make up her party.:26.32265332578578
Their table was superlatively stupid.:28.243382482956182
Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light.:9.09378009522583
A great deal more passed at the other table.:27.63915096853234
Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.:9.435146812882092
Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.:10.840580418877906
Sir William did not say much.:34.54337357579402
Collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.:25.247695817845962
The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow.:14.949665750287366
Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed.:16.612884663088582
But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr.:12.249453030827075
Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's praise into his own hands.:17.616772244132086
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with.:11.611580316343932
Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road.:11.862084955022267
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.:31.613780860188424
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr.:10.567470923191252
Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.:14.453554387338341
From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr.:16.346818672324527
Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day.:11.029371463964646
She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out.:14.36107883389936
Very few days passed in which Mr.:31.44362299089346
Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.:13.29948645236509
She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs.:9.743727720685754
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr.:12.858349076370207
Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.:7.852839563280759
Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses' reach.:14.122750748418982
Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.:9.98443159021481
In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.:21.934374651615787
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important.:13.32335391934696
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr.:27.21001303213872
Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.:10.991330116899627
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr.:22.12235992077573
Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence.:10.199420104341458
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects.:11.44653941660865
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr.:13.783675752944335
Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr.:17.09925114637083
Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him.:29.661815575115842
Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,  "I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.:12.257508386731924
Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me."  Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.:10.30204137422737
Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman.:12.516747128947717
Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs.:13.320403328612597
Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him, without saying a word.:22.207762048904858
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs.:9.574968114473453
At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family.:14.485026497161785
She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added,  "My eldest sister has been in town these three months.:18.63934168213925
Have you never happened to see her there?"  She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.:11.778287314480327
The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.:17.893527849179776
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings.:14.533325015330444
It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening.:11.562817897030474
For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter.:19.90059221653481
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr.:15.296000336397032
Darcy they had only seen at church.:34.05771488888497
Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.:11.505535839586095
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs.:14.481107307709781
Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much.:11.186870766380729
He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr.:9.487839752954578
What is it you are talking of?:38.69789212071976
What are you telling Miss Bennet?:46.05106429407896
"Of music!:215.79731841045793
Then pray speak aloud.:42.09886597549209
I must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.:26.257782184935394
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste.:11.54665635832791
If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient.:24.35610438800441
I am confident that she would have performed delightfully.:24.560428648558393
How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"  Mr.:18.714806063871134
Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.:22.48250710982995
She practises very constantly."  "So much the better.:24.825718757071606
It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.:18.051906392408174
I often tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired, without constant practice.:14.29712244689048
I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs.:13.219331768790754
Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in Mrs.:16.60433977202374
Jenkinson's room.:58.5877212183276
She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house."  Mr.:24.17540543245719
Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made no answer.:20.16974021912276
When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.:14.00265704690019
Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte, stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance.:10.358442850161817
Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,  "You mean to frighten me, Mr.:16.274926181274534
Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me?:21.9390754963115
But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.:14.073254145838591
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others.:13.579490490140667
My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me."  "I shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own."  Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.:10.36697017065851
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit.:11.833304839659355
Indeed, Mr.:51.18844886549491
Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear."  "I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.:10.977796797183023
"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried Colonel Fitzwilliam.:17.366239659265126
"I should like to know how he behaves among strangers."  "You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.:10.53953506634721
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did?:19.593820326782826
He danced only four dances!:42.84125989738761
I am sorry to pain you--but so it was.:24.693397974660908
He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.:12.560828497369416
Darcy, you cannot deny the fact."  "I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party."  "True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room.:13.210617277600017
My fingers wait your orders."  "Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers."  "Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.:9.732369283796384
"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?"  "I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying to him.:10.734941695106942
It is because he will not give himself the trouble."  "I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy, "of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.:11.434588708034028
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the trouble of practising.:16.551683297483855
It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution."  Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right.:10.526353639182307
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think any thing wanting.:20.480486247735776
We neither of us perform to strangers."  Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of.:12.445985991065008
Elizabeth immediately began playing again.:32.49895628182752
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy,  "Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master.:14.351549119973614
She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's.:15.305964211663387
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.:7.615739679662495
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home.:14.204373794273511
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane, while Mrs.:19.373683959739015
As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr.:10.6700128941161
Darcy only, entered the room.:30.338961106473512
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within.:15.529213983901034
They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.:9.688578241308159
It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed,  "How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr.:11.055779807986712
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr.:23.367419679103648
He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London."  "Perfectly so--I thank you."  She found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short pause, added,  "I think I have understood that Mr.:13.690808715641246
He has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing."  "If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there.:10.91923140866854
But perhaps Mr.:121.0055953741366
Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle."  "I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it up, as soon as any eligible purchase offers."  Elizabeth made no answer.:13.650091268073847
He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable house.:20.214167814190706
Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.:15.021767283572897
Collins first came to Hunsford."  "I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object."  "Mr.:12.674435970507147
Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife."  "Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had.:12.86818634184821
Collins as the wisest thing she ever did.:19.572377451412187
She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her."  "It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends."  "An easy distance do you call it?:12.846753087523162
It is nearly fifty miles."  "And what is fifty miles of good road?:15.318813436551682
Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance."  "I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match," cried Elizabeth.:12.761268183986342
"I should never have said Mrs.:31.019576235583262
Collins was settled _near_ her family."  "It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.:15.397515467307102
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far."  As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,  "I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family.:12.373859563736998
The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances.:20.12071754917035
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.:9.37227660808359
Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance."  Mr.:8.713780595030277
Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_You_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.:13.761615325131078
_You_ cannot have been always at Longbourn."  Elizabeth looked surprised.:24.1922475036285
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,  "Are you pleased with Kent?"  A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from their walk.:9.818751661462874
Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body, went away.:11.055286379337144
"What can be the meaning of this!" said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone.:21.82911622029651
"My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way."  But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable from the time of year.:12.234408813141775
All field sports were over.:34.7743040620437
Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.:12.733863184822038
They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt.:14.349424747903019
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.:12.345971059714715
Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand.:24.397880679732705
It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself.:10.166668291522765
He seldom appeared really animated.:35.9599847911473
Collins knew not what to make of him.:31.037004379274443
It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.:10.683624103471002
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.:12.102083414904687
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam.:17.433100488205767
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr.:11.295178931838729
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly meet Mr.:12.23321372880327
Darcy.--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a favourite haunt of hers.--How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd!--Yet it did, and even a third.:8.741455328043804
It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.:10.079606368254401
He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr.:8.977308361728014
Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too.:11.63815413872585
His words seemed to imply it.:33.28089975622113
It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.:17.096918275819913
She was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr.:11.109107622866318
Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.:11.835479641582843
Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,  "I did not know before that you ever walked this way."  "I have been making the tour of the Park," he replied, "as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage.:9.782768762326345
Are you going much farther?"  "No, I should have turned in a moment."  And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.:13.330960139459824
"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she.:18.159460378285758
He arranges the business just as he pleases."  "And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice.:16.38170077389684
Darcy."  "He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.:24.332494281240333
"But so we all do.:41.15346780177098
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.:13.997747137030453
A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence."  "In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either.:12.84653913466214
Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence?:11.279672626774346
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?"  "These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature.:10.08001869487118
But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from the want of money.:15.601183574358798
Younger sons cannot marry where they like."  "Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do."  "Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money."  "Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son?:9.637695069772116
Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."  He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.:13.159705005892363
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said,  "I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal.:9.72199016171182
But, perhaps his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her."  "No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must divide with me.:14.413117568477663
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy."  "Are you, indeed?:27.235770634558058
Does your charge give you much trouble?:22.3611492969338
She directly replied,  "You need not be frightened.:33.787251396907465
I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.:14.443805033145201
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs.:21.005254022871366
I think I have heard you say that you know them."  "I know them a little.:25.77492790856909
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man--he is a great friend of Darcy's."  "Oh!:12.991059013150645
yes," said Elizabeth drily--"Mr.:19.781811388648045
Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."  "Care of him!--Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care.:10.140207901062588
From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him.:16.64877968056336
But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant.:17.811255356054136
It was all conjecture."  "What is it you mean?"  "It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing."  "You may depend upon my not mentioning it."  "And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley.:12.07565922595413
What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."  "Did Mr.:10.448231752180888
Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"  "I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady."  "And what arts did he use to separate them?"  "He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam smiling.:11.624593163616645
"He only told me, what I have now told you."  Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation.:16.06335429440536
After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.:16.632304370067377
"Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings.:23.912626728138836
Why was he to be the judge?"  "You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"  "I do not see what right Mr.:10.590606799370725
Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy." "But," she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.:13.14565496581898
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case."  "That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."  This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr.:11.404450126711525
Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage.:10.197563881988854
It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.:16.925640421823903
There could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr.:15.76842936936241
Darcy could have such boundless influence.:37.6986624116772
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr.:17.531493507605926
Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them.:13.625833531867295
"To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of objection.:20.46146372265437
Her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.:24.243779522552543
Neither could any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which Mr.:9.825320919371125
Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach." When she thought of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.:12.076357774133788
Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.:11.98505893184418
Bingley for his sister.:80.91416611795228
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr.:13.553491942779669
Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.:14.289960206609935
Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr.:14.779829589907061
Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home.:12.200887315494475
When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr.:13.754825685427447
Darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent.:14.407627761649389
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded.:12.369081386067144
Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings.:11.800565762139396
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.:13.708055581400938
She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent, without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.:15.567070714612662
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her.:12.646637574393027
But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr.:16.437823903922265
Darcy walk into the room.:47.54668180296907
She answered him with cold civility.:40.141807424322096
He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room.:16.550495663257838
Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.:30.258180810982143
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began,  "In vain have I struggled.:14.157399202031403
It will not do.:115.49426227265842
My feelings will not be repressed.:48.24747963072073
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you."  Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.:10.60585842547559
She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent.:21.830095859763823
This he considered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her, immediately followed.:16.70140542745603
He spoke well, but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride.:15.043597003449253
She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done.:18.526503648886198
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand.:11.57526452078378
As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer.:22.103066246732684
He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security.:13.402048836127385
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said,  "In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned.:11.021080131499321
It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you.:17.1816131473076
But I cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly.:14.690598115197785
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one.:23.996006289994977
Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise.:9.449021145800623
His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature.:14.603454081636187
He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have attained it.:14.239281504867494
The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful.:40.242372782217316
At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,  "And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!:15.389884047259754
I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at civility, I am thus rejected.:16.190718182998626
But it is of small importance."  "I might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?:11.139866664852013
Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil?:14.871413551867022
You know I have.:180.9335771387403
Had not my own feelings decided against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?"  As she pronounced these words, Mr.:10.428113344326468
Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued.:12.763793353301377
"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.:24.039771614233192
No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_.:8.02561086325025
You dare not, you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind."  She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.:9.378374836111021
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.:20.101222097443586
With assumed tranquillity he then replied, "I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.:12.963200929807154
Towards _him_ I have been kinder than towards myself."  Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.:8.601849544287937
"But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike is founded.:13.748398932408353
Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided.:22.327451989389964
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr.:14.437618702411232
On this subject, what can you have to say?:41.35137771780001
or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?"  "You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said Darcy in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.:11.076231779614972
"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?"  "His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed."  "And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy.:10.890019420269006
"You have reduced him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty.:16.075199359991526
You have done all this!:79.85176619131988
This is the estimation in which you hold me!:22.37858313690558
My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed!:14.260189750262168
But perhaps," added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.:10.028264143040264
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.:24.30069310005828
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.:28.41868212737967
They were natural and just.:39.01064981014793
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?"  Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said,  "You are mistaken, Mr.:9.770259916197846
Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner."  She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,  "You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it."  Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.:11.26077953522884
She went on.:185.52593273425694
"From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."  "You have said quite enough, madam.:10.726444301158494
I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.:26.98027775027095
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great.:37.66574240242959
Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it.:16.34114225326207
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr.:14.743563663418781
that he should have been in love with her for so many months!:26.20675300695103
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible!:13.697362684260012
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection.:14.380327087238857
But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.:11.940113077514033
Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.:11.103024992726919
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.:11.223648734370233
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes.:14.760933888954991
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise.:11.118619913003272
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr.:19.665272051774917
The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.:14.59616712081293
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park.:13.089753369064077
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.:17.42847512295507
She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr.:10.043357635764657
Darcy, she was directly retreating.:40.49486962886767
But the person who advanced, was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name.:12.297798034798511
She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr.:18.506412753397942
Darcy, she moved again towards the gate.:27.45590769131317
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"--And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.:12.863815449869733
With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand.--The envelope itself was likewise full.--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.:7.783012785861159
I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling      myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both,      cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation,      and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been      spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.:11.522673640020454
You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your      attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I      demand it of your justice.:11.675212323366491
"Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal      magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.:14.505466189355369
The first mentioned      was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached      Mr.:21.527968706432585
Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in      defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,      ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr.:9.95034819962922
Wickham.--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of      my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who      had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who      had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,      to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could      be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--But      from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally      bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in      future secured, when the following account of my actions and their      motives has been read.--If, in the explanation of them which is      due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which      may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry.--The      necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--I      had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with      others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other      young woman in the country.--But it was not till the evening of the      dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a      serious attachment.--I had often seen him in love before.--At that      ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made      acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that      Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general      expectation of their marriage.:10.262840198261724
He spoke of it as a certain event,      of which the time alone could be undecided.:24.804139727046607
From that moment I      observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then      perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had      ever witnessed in him.:13.112980511765286
Your sister I also watched.--Her look and      manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any      symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the      evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with      pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of      sentiment.--If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have      been in an error.:8.945374863488484
But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity      of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given      the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her      temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was      desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will      venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually      influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be      indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial      conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to      the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged      to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my      own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to      my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of      repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to      an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to      forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes      must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother's      family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that      total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed      by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by      your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you.:8.499149589158463
But amidst      your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your      displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you      consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to      avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally      bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to      the sense and disposition of both.--I will only say farther, that      from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was      confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me      before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy      connection.--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,      as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon      returning.--The part which I acted, is now to be explained.--His      sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our      coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible      that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly      resolved on joining him directly in London.--We accordingly      went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to      my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--I described, and      enforced them earnestly.--But, however this remonstrance might have      staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it      would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been      seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your      sister's indifference.:9.440132066318164
He had before believed her to return his      affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--But Bingley has      great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment      than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived      himself, was no very difficult point.:10.492131795296759
To persuade him against      returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,      was scarcely the work of a moment.--I cannot blame myself for      having done thus much.:13.137715408954788
There is but one part of my conduct in the      whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is      that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to      conceal from him your sister's being in town.:11.345805443511907
I knew it myself, as      it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant      of it.--That they might have met without ill consequence, is      perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough      extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--Perhaps this      concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--It is done, however,      and it was done for the best.--On this subject I have nothing more      to say, no other apology to offer.:11.499254216021074
Wickham, I can only      refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my      family.:15.16643288619035
Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but      of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one      witness of undoubted veracity.:14.285054144263352
Wickham is the son of a very      respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the      Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his      trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on      George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore      liberally bestowed.:11.333136113570976
My father supported him at school, and      afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own      father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have      been unable to give him a gentleman's education.:11.861660322467797
My father was not      only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always      engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the      church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.:13.671343756706397
As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think      of him in a very different manner.:19.380882716414067
The vicious propensities--the      want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge      of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man      of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of      seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.:10.859871526036567
Darcy could not have.:133.26347743556315
Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.:13.052236240900026
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr.:28.527207066837875
Wickham has created, a      suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his      real character.:10.664321603256727
It adds even another motive.:36.35213289679793
My excellent father      died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr.:14.291469574896283
Wickham was to      the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it      to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his      profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a      valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became      vacant.:12.096447015672807
There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.:14.077575925002531
His own      father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these      events, Mr.:14.234903045996164
Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally      resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it      unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary      advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be      benefited.:11.605244800636548
He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,      and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would      be a very insufficient support therein.:14.944765114501285
I rather wished, than      believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to      accede to his proposal.:16.98271405737846
I knew that Mr.:66.15040241265227
Wickham ought not to be a      clergyman.:43.49613398188577
The business was therefore soon settled.:42.491545339675184
All connection between us seemed now dissolved.:19.23661280262568
I      thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his      society in town.:18.65651075618213
For      about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the      incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied      to me again by letter for the presentation.:15.539657136285644
His circumstances, he      assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were      exceedingly bad.:22.44399109984598
He had found the law a most unprofitable study,      and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would      present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there      could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other      person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered      father's intentions.:11.933028588377539
You will hardly blame me for refusing to      comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.:9.951310130846451
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his      circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me      to others, as in his reproaches to myself.:16.397564036101254
After this period, every      appearance of acquaintance was dropt.:17.154429415996976
How he lived I know not.:33.201541770112975
I      must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget      myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce      me to unfold to any human being.:12.614448986204843
Having said thus much, I feel no      doubt of your secrecy.:21.28309345947719
My sister, who is more than ten years my      junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel      Fitzwilliam, and myself.:17.237882109094226
About a year ago, she was taken from      school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last      summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;      and thither also went Mr.:13.427474724866398
Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there      proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.:10.11098661092405
Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by      her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,      whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his      kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe      herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.:10.903796843525065
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the      intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea      of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as      a father, acknowledged the whole to me.:9.42097788326096
Younge was of course removed from      her charge.:19.348771403165383
His revenge would have been complete indeed.:35.08192234565464
This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we      have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject      it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty      towards Mr.:10.481759300601238
I know not in what manner, under what form of      falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to      be wondered at.:14.877606937774074
You may possibly      wonder why all this was not told you last night.:17.3140195721023
But I was not then      master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.:17.666722694621335
For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more      particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our      near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of      the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted      with every particular of these transactions.:10.111943245952913
If your abhorrence of      _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented      by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may      be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find      some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course      of the morning.:10.330575093133971
I will only add, God bless you.:16.233152368515643
"FITZWILLIAM DARCY."     CHAPTER XIII.:44.31308883216392
If Elizabeth, when Mr.:76.93866478239073
Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents.:15.39882720922458
With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield.:16.499111693309274
She read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes.:12.042894974975725
His belief of her sister's insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice.:16.93952961842337
He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.:13.203074919757919
It was all pride and insolence.:36.612519295677785
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.:21.09673498874585
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.:14.573375798262626
She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false!:15.56045446466265
This cannot be!:206.82517606302193
This must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.:12.700517796772386
In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.:11.888798481550172
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr.:22.6909543811854
Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words.:13.1021751061592
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err.:12.991335785094362
She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with little success.:10.929442756487196
On both sides it was only assertion.:34.33265494348144
Again she read on.:62.80730399870186
But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to render Mr.:10.585142645073578
Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.:13.903896317857887
Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.:13.566423380095836
She had never heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance.:12.905974902113947
Of his former way of life, nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself.:20.441103918306418
As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of enquiring.:19.240938670424253
His countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.:27.225966162255435
Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr.:9.605898713941066
Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance.:12.644416221933836
But no such recollection befriended her.:27.901159516178055
She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.:11.88510141158111
After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read.:15.679887007040419
But, alas!:103.33095162426193
the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question.:11.675141368549106
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr.:13.879259462169458
Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration.:15.686708791489028
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr.:17.18425133272049
Philips's.:94.98827615512488
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct.:14.03201022690691
Darcy--that Mr.:66.98478328023293
Darcy might leave the country, but that _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week.:10.287185223998582
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned!:18.830792128338395
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.:9.714235661259838
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn.:10.993459471589219
Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr.:20.58726532691087
Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits.:9.021391104637784
That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling.:10.017733354944673
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr.:10.937980114825457
Bingley, was incomprehensible.:105.16095902773601
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.:8.776414602038946
"How despicably have I acted!" she cried.--"I, who have prided myself on my discernment!--I, who have valued myself on my abilities!:9.482652660869256
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--How humiliating is this discovery!--Yet, how just a humiliation!--Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind.:8.264726012785957
But vanity, not love, has been my folly.--Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned.:13.036227200858756
Till this moment, I never knew myself."  From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr.:12.42783202004792
Darcy's explanation _there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.:16.009871905578102
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe.:13.330138111360046
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.:12.216059255854633
It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before.:11.221461553846687
After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.:8.787477300791473
She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr.:10.978873452617503
Darcy, only for a few minutes to take leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.--Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it.:11.567747981297199
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object.:23.655998169526278
She could think only of her letter.:48.355126539629254
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr.:17.347524978028073
Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings.:8.73187878168596
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return, brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.:13.228820797072023
"What would she have said?--how would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself.:9.501312808896355
But I am particularly attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!--They were excessively sorry to go!:16.464562674414903
But so they always are.:43.87714779597069
His attachment to Rosings, certainly increases."  Mr.:16.777359717167258
Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.:16.254413064432626
Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,  "But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer.:14.346898965341952
Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure."  "I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it.--I must be in town next Saturday."  "Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.:13.548877096003752
I expected you to stay two months.:35.5555788437734
I told Mrs.:140.2863107751067
Collins so before you came.:46.81674307962854
Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight."  "But my father cannot.--He wrote last week to hurry my return."  "Oh!:9.078532369861854
"Mrs.:340.10195889872244
Collins, you must send a servant with them.:22.348213777528514
You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.:13.47892065370412
It is highly improper.:62.37720238148272
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing.--Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life.:8.761455657429448
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go with her.--Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr.:12.554133470483386
Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--I am excessively attentive to all those things.:14.189372624674993
You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs.:19.20487692839314
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone."  "My uncle is to send a servant for us."  "Oh!--Your uncle!--He keeps a man-servant, does he?--I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things.:9.372688945264247
Bromley, of course.--If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to."  Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.:11.06313960706333
Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.:15.873450359737388
When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.:10.294354677316015
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.:9.461024441946932
In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.:11.498078518705425
They were hopeless of remedy.:33.748783170735344
Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.:12.25650678488245
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement?:10.486213733848183
Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing.:8.719377939613892
They were ignorant, idle, and vain.:32.699357738767866
While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for ever.:13.655193220974558
Anxiety on Jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr.:14.639724219773251
Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.:14.08967802665016
How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!:11.917460900978146
The very last evening was spent there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.:11.091087739224212
When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.:10.18371903985383
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr.:26.573067533016918
Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.:9.463812914553229
"I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs.:20.788648602615517
Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it.:11.979066775435307
The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you.:27.628007920364396
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode.:21.43013573447997
Our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly."  Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.:9.658957104267834
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_ feel the obliged.:13.680617932503017
Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity replied,  "It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably.:12.92485376415828
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.:7.250654429286837
You see on what a footing we are.:33.43904227686632
You see how continually we are engaged there.:26.559027788246375
In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings."  Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.:10.555342263807256
"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin.:15.088603017850417
I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so.:25.990763928851692
Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs.:17.75167235997733
Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be as well to be silent.:11.576701529746446
Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.:12.902661619563059
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us.:14.839743266447444
She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung.:15.563596789940476
Poor Charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to such society!--But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.:12.262737900049054
Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.:14.662716628314037
At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.:14.434854428552082
Gardiner, though unknown.:73.62591240548562
"But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here."  Elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.:12.993181361139891
"Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have happened!"  "A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.:10.025175722095556
"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!--How much I shall have to tell!"  Elizabeth privately added, "And how much I shall have to conceal."  Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr.:8.851271774997496
Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days.:22.1392108042596
Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them.:11.448487321585405
But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.:23.2402383261454
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr.:12.21687293067829
Darcy's proposals.:67.16978247643115
To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister farther.:11.344273304866025
It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr.:9.421299409183563
Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.:13.321282048789225
These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber.:7.7114560362097
After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, "Is not this nice?:7.91203986602081
is not this an agreeable surprise?"  "And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia; "but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there." Then shewing her purchases: "Look here, I have bought this bonnet.:9.531562350758703
I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.:17.792412441178623
I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better."  And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, "Oh!:12.495638178387237
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable.:9.964559628821789
Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight."  "Are they indeed?" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.:10.790934871474706
It would be such a delicious scheme, and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all.:15.061823406238297
Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!"  "Yes," thought Elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once.:12.017752328309689
Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton."  "Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down to table.:10.36649404713197
"What do you think?:63.030386842898174
It is excellent news, capital news, and about a certain person that we all like."  Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he need not stay.:12.026302210040845
Lydia laughed, and said,  "Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.:18.044091720783737
You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared!:27.025455702318506
I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say.:12.536464259407449
But he is an ugly fellow!:40.45925158200073
I am glad he is gone.:47.77280820889376
I never saw such a long chin in my life.:23.715074654662505
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King.:17.276474213814215
She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay.:21.666092690144268
Wickham is safe."  "And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune."  "She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."  "But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane.:10.22894884143448
"I am sure there is not on _his_.:28.0806751416025
Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing?"  Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal!:9.088647948204452
As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.:11.48982560205124
"I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox!:12.069336972031845
Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home.:13.417598888604928
And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all, since you went away.:18.00658914773428
Have you seen any pleasant men?:28.280492113299765
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.:18.371186637952807
Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.:25.223935397569242
She is almost three and twenty!:33.801768582869244
Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty!:12.194141213574909
My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think.:14.695170348249166
Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it.:17.953697328816286
Lord!:342.4436903211594
how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.:17.276051513181617
Dear me!:229.18425018480974
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's.:16.55926891106438
Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs.:20.554029836885146
Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs.:15.023793504806072
Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?:10.852249796545106
We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a lady,--only think what fun!:10.39819201337368
Not a soul knew of it, but Col.:35.364389125364376
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!:16.77565343628433
When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least.:23.672936512062734
how I laughed!:96.48658757209446
and so did Mrs.:72.28460123043598
Forster.:1675.5718681032183
I thought I should have died.:45.79729763528592
And _that_ made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."  With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn.:9.59721501563306
Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.:14.745326470786061
Their reception at home was most kind.:34.13553637401133
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr.:12.990976838214738
Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth,  "I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."  Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs.:8.562541034461361
Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.:10.896726183290061
Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!:14.649645264373584
as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too.:11.387889853896104
And then when we came away it was such fun!:24.563342524859678
I thought we never should have got into the coach.:29.673414694585514
And then we were so merry all the way home!:28.45633908520884
They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds.:12.299576893603907
But I confess they would have no charms for _me_.:25.162052201888578
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.:11.38243895436306
It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.:21.391773632069636
There was another reason too for her opposition.:23.957367973318327
She dreaded seeing Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.:18.879694640552124
The comfort to _her_, of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression.:20.573888192122354
In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.:19.955082645256486
She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.:12.198445580270336
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.:10.082114754486204
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.:11.596385267053781
Darcy and herself.:109.53946107569865
She was sorry that Mr.:39.807684305695055
Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.:11.216502824034329
"His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment."  "Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.:11.155504895401927
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"  "Blame you!:21.929033717131603
Oh, no."  "But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham."  "No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."  "But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very next day."  She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham.:10.892757267076105
What a stroke was this for poor Jane!:15.739359533599202
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual.:9.559676673737712
Nor was Darcy's vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.:13.97958825364508
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other.:10.355097805769383
"This will not do," said Elizabeth.:37.29394011509463
"You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing.:20.54522484258323
Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one.:24.861719009148132
Darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse."  It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.:15.787301500142817
"I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she.:17.800045085666508
"Wickham so very bad!:67.0746086996275
It is almost past belief.:40.62988738237254
And poor Mr.:161.2785708296218
It is really too distressing.:43.107855331667416
I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.:11.024106855186297
Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather."  "Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance!:12.005728897846558
such an openness and gentleness in his manner."  "There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men.:11.777772937244935
It is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind.:14.69082211343152
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty."  "Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now."  "Indeed I could not.:11.26937548699733
I was uncomfortable enough.:68.6926876861162
I was very uncomfortable, I may say unhappy.:32.130125364016514
And with no one to speak to, of what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had!:16.58006168535142
how I wanted you!"  "How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr.:9.571427047789594
Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved."  "Certainly.:15.844222115053734
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging.:16.342764787985693
There is one point, on which I want your advice.:25.666337035048056
I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham's character."  Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, "Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.:12.071041752881403
What is your own opinion?"  "That it ought not to be attempted.:27.36906663656291
Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public.:20.685064825698696
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me?:13.911140424628401
The general prejudice against Mr.:46.04916796285196
Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light.:15.94126582828263
I am not equal to it.:44.19131588494293
Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.:9.04496497312501
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character.:14.421796764874736
She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either.:14.562956023715227
But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbad the disclosure.:11.834079007340288
She dared not relate the other half of Mr.:18.970660495191186
Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend.:15.593549580979227
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery.:7.877274378814574
"And then," said she, "if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.:11.107668872612063
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"  She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits.:12.575499350232374
Jane was not happy.:99.33526691493898
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley.:25.294869086454266
"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs.:29.613116803085788
For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody.:20.527890169248032
I told my sister Philips so the other day.:25.463309474019532
But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London.:21.516315007934335
Well, he is a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now.:16.225184811381407
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every body too, who is likely to know."  "I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more."  "Oh, well!:14.292547150492027
Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done."  But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.:12.587258399310302
"Well, Lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they?:17.133535524385223
Well, well, I only hope it will last.:28.082888118400053
And what sort of table do they keep?:23.31000945869334
Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say.:22.375759659317197
If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough.:20.561607863614917
There is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping, I dare say."  "No, nothing at all."  "A great deal of good management, depend upon it.:10.933837558433774
Yes, yes.:93.27931526262607
_They_ will take care not to outrun their income.:13.904612947731769
Well, much good may it do them!:18.78903267890382
And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead.:18.215033199218702
They look upon it quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens."  "It was a subject which they could not mention before me."  "No.:14.87250179172926
But I make no doubt, they often talk of it between themselves.:20.653890648968126
Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.:17.85919800940898
_I_ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."     CHAPTER XVIII.:12.699221367847134
The first week of their return was soon gone.:29.29557446417136
The second began.:191.22611717777912
It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace.:19.773324278457316
The dejection was almost universal.:54.54732666005887
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.:13.498452475447394
What are we to do!" would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.:12.069595080773693
"How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?"  Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years ago.:8.281279994601366
"I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel Millar's regiment went away.:9.513084329082107
I thought I should have broke my heart."  "I am sure I shall break _mine_," said Lydia.:13.716075256687985
"Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton!:15.9633180077972
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn-house.:11.046194719618569
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.:16.5929045289337
She felt anew the justice of Mr.:18.145986030020723
Darcy's objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.:16.932407485146914
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs.:11.138446381630397
Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.:26.16658079006831
This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married.:25.233574573543642
A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.:11.514254095543142
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs.:20.161875338269617
Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.:7.497148256228655
"I cannot see why Mrs.:28.23433414468302
Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia," said she, "though I am _not_ her particular friend.:13.325614422734905
I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older."  In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned.:16.10221845527014
As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go.:12.677314581974755
She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs.:14.656530258500535
Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home.:11.709351895823861
He heard her attentively, and then said,  "Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances."  "If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair."  "Already arisen!" repeated Mr.:10.439081022239472
"What, has she frightened away some of your lovers?:22.599909685051085
Poor little Lizzy!:75.10798776691392
But do not be cast down.:49.49124939289707
Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly."  "Indeed you are mistaken.:11.871756888605983
I have no such injuries to resent.:26.358602762505804
It is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining.:17.504705364481932
Excuse me--for I must speak plainly.:25.74964758906557
If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.:11.720219856358437
Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous.:18.10884691402525
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended.:23.999089705576164
She will follow wherever Lydia leads.:25.257670912970685
Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled!:16.84632085176387
my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?"  Mr.:13.264099458039446
Wherever you and Jane are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three very silly sisters.:9.173373192472882
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton.:15.731898027805931
Let her go then.:37.5556776684772
Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body.:11.680023219657986
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here.:15.364052910765045
The officers will find women better worth their notice.:16.497939463857062
Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance.:16.349425283379265
At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life."  With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.:10.494389331867122
It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.:15.05628350752014
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility.:12.07086436417572
In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness.:14.238058637692891
She saw with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers.:10.81049323996225
She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown.:18.345435404358327
She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.:7.546124461375768
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?:12.302783922485025
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.:13.668562752373207
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving home.:12.746827166546787
Elizabeth was now to see Mr.:48.87713739031566
Wickham for the last time.:78.06440426081288
She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.:10.211056922951222
In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her.:10.187566356678717
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.:10.217561568854745
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr.:12.436706522774397
He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man, asked her how she had liked him.:12.47927702400967
Her answer was warmly in his favour.:32.75873681376761
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, "How long did you say that he was at Rosings?"  "Nearly three weeks."  "And you saw him frequently?"  "Yes, almost every day."  "His manners are very different from his cousin's."  "Yes, very different.:12.465202030690543
But I think Mr.:82.09461140180485
Darcy improves on acquaintance."  "Indeed!" cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her.:15.121364372649904
"And pray may I ask?" but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "Is it in address that he improves?:14.248080521368587
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style?:12.862909982710903
for I dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials."  "Oh, no!" said Elizabeth.:13.744568826637867
"In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was."  While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.:10.182725730983215
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added,  "When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."  Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents,  "You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr.:9.601539418407816
His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by.:16.69426930591108
I only fear that the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe.:12.003299965731264
His fear of her, has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart."  Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head.:13.491469356875047
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him.:16.94164521397734
Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning.:15.870305019757708
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.:19.039281446767745
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.:10.77419240328638
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort.:11.916656845834634
Her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her.:9.634944963371682
But Mr.:202.40783659769184
Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.:9.363198198507764
He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments.:15.545465018978947
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.:12.911558663523403
This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.:9.582675260376751
Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband.:21.55969413001666
She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible.:11.372099801416102
But she had never felt so strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.:7.3955098490144255
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.:14.755984439492448
Their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp.:8.098888023123257
Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself.:12.948637481168193
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment.:9.625226722252705
"But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to wish for.:18.93193708807968
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.:25.59921934202457
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized.:13.976283129105004
A scheme of which every part promises delight, can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation."  When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short.:10.222715880525428
Those to her mother, contained little else, than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs.:10.204228222319761
Forster called her, and they were going to the camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public.:13.662883005210526
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn.:11.845342560773597
Everything wore a happier aspect.:12.552198176681348
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.:15.632485842790995
Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.:8.614200326687108
Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent.:11.218295671518533
In that county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs.:18.650447632678883
Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.:25.987746420203475
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.:11.417067888144055
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.:12.67237921099141
But it was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.:19.3219411379579
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner.:17.37540474859837
"But surely," said she, "I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."  The period of expectation was now doubled.:9.177417403965931
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival.:17.01882624686986
But they did pass away, and Mr.:33.07198068917725
Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn.:19.088468111618706
The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.:10.4904441528495
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.:13.35058479970445
One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.:5.730015238093915
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &c.:6.65450974355951
are sufficiently known.:103.875803352067
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern.:32.51890074857125
To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs.:21.884053359044316
It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.:17.139311261737085
In talking over their route the evening before, Mrs.:21.976349474507952
Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again.:18.458841425403115
Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.:19.48754348695046
"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?" said her aunt.:23.051678865418083
"A place too, with which so many of your acquaintance are connected.:24.60390446067291
Wickham passed all his youth there, you know."  Elizabeth was distressed.:23.095382811970026
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.:13.006062501080013
Gardiner abused her stupidity.:34.5855428251712
"If it were merely a fine house richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful.:10.24978301300181
They have some of the finest woods in the country."  Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce.:19.717628049698646
The possibility of meeting Mr.:45.820688840444355
It would be dreadful!:78.04465928335814
She blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk.:20.905045771762417
But against this, there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.:15.445647172562857
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer.:11.938567957254522
A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme.:11.313079370350595
To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.:43.14137672694149

[Illustration: DOVE-DALE]     PRIDE & PREJUDICE.:5.897924558266815
Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.:11.77036413157023
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.:25.366825389214696
They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.:9.289278343329446
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view.:11.82923040382648
They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.:8.985502960869688
It was a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.:7.194182952038502
Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely adorned.:12.126562276732539
Elizabeth was delighted.:133.4189155820672
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.:11.042175674620557
They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned.:10.50968894524816
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken.:26.428634637741794
On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.:17.28123010389069
The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.:12.70867147489766
They followed her into the dining-parlour.:24.23683780581172
The hill, crowned with wood, from which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.:11.355719004048376
Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight.:16.584455955095166
As they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen.:8.88858033348871
"And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress!:24.90011434977252
With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!:21.639036032825064
Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--But no,"--recollecting herself,--"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them."  This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.:9.186226361619655
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really absent, but had not courage for it.:15.074572974081574
Reynolds replied, that he was, adding, "but we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends." How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!:10.438732404002153
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture.:31.015572275494325
Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantle-piece.:8.712849070218054
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expence.--"He is now gone into the army," she added, "but I am afraid he has turned out very wild."  Mrs.:11.097280051178762
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it.:22.62093253952817
"And that," said Mrs.:50.43393342812546
Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, "is my master--and very like him.:15.073783473219034
It was drawn at the same time as the other--about eight years ago."  "I have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs.:12.357886652530468
Gardiner, looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face.:20.279087439939914
But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not."  Mrs.:16.54080832104595
"Does that young lady know Mr.:25.20936446600264
Darcy?"  Elizabeth coloured, and said--"A little."  "And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?"  "Yes, very handsome."  "I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.:10.429983042316245
He was very fond of them."  This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr.:19.454173657410944
Wickham's being among them.:27.856204789857845
"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mr.:23.9860936238501
yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long.:8.175287834408339
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him."  Mr.:11.730974613117805
Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs.:6.99336605543886
Reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.:11.313239534637324
"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"  "Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months."  "Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate."  "If your master would marry, you might see more of him."  "Yes, Sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be.:11.756180517565925
I do not know who is good enough for him."  Mr.:19.324649289912497
Gardiner smiled.:231.31539412012089
Elizabeth could not help saying, "It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so."  "I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows him," replied the other.:14.674662371902027
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old."  This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas.:11.04033398740394
That he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest opinion.:22.01002081391997
You are lucky in having such a master."  "Yes, Sir, I know I am.:20.677396885281144
But I have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the world."  Elizabeth almost stared at her.--"Can this be Mr.:8.609493034358596
Darcy!" thought she.:88.32861126855181
"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs.:25.57761950715698
"Yes, Ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just as affable to the poor."  Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.:11.783929261781001
Reynolds could interest her on no other point.:15.519757072450924
She related the subject of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain.:23.198790679064388
Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.:9.92785024521564
Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but themselves.:13.090713398176602
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name.:18.970004770254604
Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it.:12.968717470579428
To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men."  "In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought Elizabeth.:11.25205764862331
"This fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."  "Perhaps we might be deceived."  "That is not very likely; our authority was too good."  On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when last at Pemberley.:9.459880586209197
"He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.:20.37839760560274
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter the room.:15.995239639879626
"And this is always the way with him," she added.--"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment.:15.236104326186679
There is nothing he would not do for her."  The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were all that remained to be shewn.:15.728427590304324
In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.:10.625747187083245
In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger.:15.608784009015723
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.:18.965641463103402
At last it arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr.:11.694522312102212
Darcy, with such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her.:20.500354097762358
Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his father's life time.:18.638507764401396
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance.:15.42578370818915
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs.:29.04459684125252
Reynolds was of no trifling nature.:22.249980803979405
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?:18.150960824568195
As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--How much of good or evil must be done by him!:13.275426000501623
Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.:11.885439139042386
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.:14.575534027484117
As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.:11.168702737676599
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.:11.281178786928983
Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush.:14.403240131943534
He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.:14.015071086886522
She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome.:13.821697615608157
Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr.:12.48956248206141
Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it.:14.519673813031881
They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family.:10.694440995965229
Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most uncomfortable of her life.:12.153768374525841
Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.:12.460215768374713
At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.:12.816684553835904
She was overpowered by shame and vexation.:20.871831800493315
How strange must it appear to him!:33.11386381156835
It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again!:20.517787325900326
why did she come?:54.678376832282666
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?:23.055591160525722
Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.:12.350775935974823
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting.:20.70376380378507
And his behaviour, so strikingly altered,--what could it mean?:18.919786241880036
That he should even speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her family!:17.942798588254178
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when he put his letter into her hand!:11.911565665071818
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr.:15.07163859173369
Darcy then was.:146.29171401557258
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing, she was still dear to him.:14.487694109287018
Perhaps he had been civil, only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was not like ease.:14.624206621500742
At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.:13.467770771422177
They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.:10.115512774349867
Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.:15.616903259658468
With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten miles round.:19.339290957655454
It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.:12.761335726405196
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs.:11.057977624402735
Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr.:12.715749942165006
Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little.:13.496568135865061
Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr.:13.366175853264062
Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance.:34.542915665475896
The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met.:17.280986219337326
Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them.:13.427576557275062
For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.:15.568265974135977
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them.:10.962198904921877
With a glance she saw, that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed.:10.69753907842776
Her colour changed, and she said no more.:36.4023914863219
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself.:11.021667402394579
"What will be his surprise," thought she, "when he knows who they are!:20.96436888354731
He takes them now for people of fashion."  The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.:10.5403201536306
That he was _surprised_ by the connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr.:11.503560611153262
Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph.:21.268468777804866
It was consoling, that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush.:12.485813562049868
She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.:13.945363696461957
The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr.:20.936227199924726
Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder.:13.100169183500507
Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself.:17.945515304697853
Her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was she repeating, "Why is he so altered?:17.725483188989873
From what can it proceed?:56.392607378012976
It is impossible that he should still love me."  After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.:10.742333276962169
It originated in Mrs.:54.186216623789015
Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's.:13.046918014835708
Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together.:21.235050317466293
After a short silence, the lady first spoke.:22.27967347110212
"They will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr.:9.128667472756433
Bingley and his sisters."  Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.:20.27815297616571
Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr.:19.316518652452658
Bingley's name had been last mentioned between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged.:12.874904115763632
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her, must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.:14.750365100699762
They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought.:15.409309524667847
Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased.:21.662242735038635
His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of the highest kind.:29.912329247533368
They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr.:18.609362759952965
Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.:22.739671502327155
He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn.:17.536040905582556
At such a time, much might have been said, and silence was very awkward.:27.600833210304828
She wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject.:17.914474861259965
At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.:12.475913810935067
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over.:8.891569261801118
On Mr.:223.62001857633754
Gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness.:11.564492482150149
Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.:15.780523530456797
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.:17.633126855034917
"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.:19.94703990189026
"There _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.:17.430183096145107
I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it."  "I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.:11.364727445391605
It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention.:17.977046275537045
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling."  "To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as Wickham; or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good.:15.919256745487372
But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable?"  Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.:11.917092889267147
"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied her uncle.:22.97030590339889
"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds."  Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing.:11.765490500158291
"From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs.:28.61759714826288
Gardiner, "I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body, as he has done by poor Wickham.:15.574403505549814
On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks.:12.475520102427172
And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.:18.572788361862326
But to be sure, the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming character!:16.99326490804053
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.:24.41252338099191
But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue."  Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire.:12.228793177772214
In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.:13.35675074818319
Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of any thing else.:11.02454709988656
Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.:12.609079189637992
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr.:12.96721609260111
Darcy's civility, and above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.:27.501828458636634
Darcy would bring his sister to visit her, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.:16.428250074174926
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle, driving up the street.:12.727543651553933
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business.:16.848482864380326
Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece.:12.95181138412349
While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing.:8.61718456214266
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.:10.70532117929365
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place.:22.85490866206732
With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.:16.724881306878093
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.:14.68395166512505
Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful.:13.091127082805672
She was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.:14.530063078514074
Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr.:10.777856332540328
They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.:12.713381251263964
All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her again.:12.18096601239262
He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.:15.917490433279287
Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself.:18.409292244949906
They had long wished to see him.:37.81971954368847
The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr.:25.901329014160673
Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love.:10.38254787501157
Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.:11.964314027035787
Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.:46.94078944981496
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.:12.709905375091193
In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!:26.575014613993623
No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard.:13.262301012039147
Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister.:19.15963855590909
On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.:10.722072157818456
He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "It is above eight months.:14.41851588408319
We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield."  Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn.:10.135023815172225
There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.:18.470959147942246
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr.:21.561763481461064
Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.:9.73726698946263
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose to depart, Mr.:11.59022193682919
Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr.:19.95049398751951
Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country.:25.640640132473287
Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed.:11.571757857876431
Presuming, however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.:11.70991290950052
Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little.:13.703164029138145
Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.:11.287583039235843
But she had no reason to fear Mr.:25.86515761124037
Gardiner's curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication.:15.458000873587313
It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr.:24.367734701944364
Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her.:20.70923592304508
They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.:26.464437675952915
Of Mr.:181.32494780354293
Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.:14.998772889580072
They could not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known, would not have recognised it for Mr.:13.123030797122874
There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible, that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected.:12.404878763989677
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight.:15.228081342059678
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town, where the family did not visit.:12.35145147916892
It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.:17.846094842972388
With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr.:10.872945937931252
Darcy afterwards discharged.:102.90836013016592
As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out.:11.885832262521458
She certainly did not hate him.:47.755586636561176
No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called.:12.708679212796621
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced.:11.289380053041478
But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked.:12.972122584276809
It was gratitude.--Gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.:9.740274926970638
He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.:9.612010976863017
Such a change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.:11.869341555051179
She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.:12.74249321734965
It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning.:11.75331148090837
They were, therefore, to go.--Elizabeth was pleased, though, when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.:21.145821133203064
Gardiner left them soon after breakfast.:36.24865090159174
Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.:8.243388137946896
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs.:17.57012819520459
Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved.:10.873500844567408
By Mrs.:205.13792352253196
Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments.:10.08294571445143
It was first broken by Mrs.:27.081156344375945
Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.:18.94660713139142
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.:13.378664102888628
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention.:13.122679947514346
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much.:13.274446771435011
Her own thoughts were employing her.:32.40022969840261
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.:17.618448986181185
She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.:15.988577286235708
After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family.:10.68555580699868
She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.:16.397203001645938
Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post.:21.101332002680962
There was now employment for the whole party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected them round the table.:10.73704176860881
Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.:16.705084776342566
He had been some time with Mr.:32.782159393047486
Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning.:13.156102095385148
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr.:9.502485084308972
Darcy were by no means over.:34.42039287993378
Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.:13.401378721511366
While she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.:9.311184306080394
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that corps.:10.591994873413922
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement.:16.81335870861935
Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more.:9.547848229931205
Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.:12.759337000967351
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned; and while Mr.:11.88312187134478
Darcy was attending them to their carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress.:13.51345200634292
But Georgiana would not join her.:43.55169284909118
Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.:10.637635814886911
When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.:15.647711694225979
"How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr.:15.773454024454235
Darcy," she cried; "I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.:17.17785797157737
She is grown so brown and coarse!:16.99101076175729
Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again."  However little Mr.:12.663986674833463
Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.:9.60732902793673
"For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her.:17.47398007952065
Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.:14.676535557169245
Her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines.:14.652031485011811
Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them.:13.111306113851324
They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable."  Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.:10.372445204032463
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both.:13.354398849469227
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.:13.225577845784805
They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every thing but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs.:18.98289530327337
Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs.:39.11316935462288
Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject.:20.068192203401015
CHAPTER IV.:110.2249848057666
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere.:11.81889913723472
Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.:17.518097360480443
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves.:11.518139712223311
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence.:10.079694330347031
It was to this effect:       "Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of      a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming      you--be assured that we are all well.:8.534388062171638
What I have to say relates to      poor Lydia.:23.756721985352033
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were      all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was      gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,      with Wickham!--Imagine our surprise.:10.277939955845161
To Kitty, however, it does not      seem so wholly unexpected.:26.969393996705346
I am very, very sorry.:39.1437066321114
So imprudent a      match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that      his character has been misunderstood.:14.568126302536115
Thoughtless and indiscreet I      can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it)      marks nothing bad at heart.:7.635077325213907
His choice is disinterested at least,      for he must know my father can give her nothing.:19.585498803646125
Our poor mother      is sadly grieved.:18.807423580999625
My father bears it better.:31.580300142534778
How thankful am I,      that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must      forget it ourselves.:13.951799187061962
The express was sent off directly.:30.948530203190025
My dear Lizzy, they must      have passed within ten miles of us.:17.927664733898958
Colonel Forster gives us reason      to expect him here soon.:12.176019597820344
Lydia left a few lines for his wife,      informing her of their intention.:17.584244986396534
I am afraid you will not be able to make      it out, but I hardly know what I have written."  Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.:10.011952610172218
"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried      letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not      confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer      for being coherent.:12.71948045114214
Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would      write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.:17.327863362523946
Imprudent as a marriage between Mr.:25.201179352891945
Wickham and our poor Lydia      would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for      there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.:14.15603357470066
Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day      before, not many hours after the express.:12.984009669336535
F.:279.6090698783234
gave them to understand that they were going to      Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief      that W.:7.71132458671191
who instantly taking the alarm, set off      from B.:13.326774414025572
intending to trace their route.:17.536729871284045
He did trace them easily to      Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed      into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them      from Epsom.:6.8246464112092164
All that is known after this is, that they were seen      to continue the London road.:16.46046690613606
After making      every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F.:14.394326915562015
came on into      Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at      the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such      people had been seen to pass through.:9.82136444447816
With the kindest concern he      came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner      most creditable to his heart.:12.98988684633502
I am sincerely grieved for him and      Mrs.:25.53005264599707
but no one can throw any blame on them.:16.118398664422394
Our distress, my      dear Lizzy, is very great.:30.72410267530335
My father and mother believe the worst,      but I cannot think so ill of him.:14.329931794164349
Many circumstances might make it      more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to      pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design      against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely,      can I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible.:9.753865765124132
I grieve to      find, however, that Colonel F.:29.835001746564906
is not disposed to depend upon their      marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he      feared W.:12.514440915439156
was not a man to be trusted.:67.09543150107078
My poor mother is really ill      and keeps her room.:14.505362793511654
Could she exert herself it would be better, but      this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life      saw him so affected.:17.920795549668842
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed      their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot      wonder.:9.969816169183234
I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared      something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock      is over, shall I own that I long for your return?:11.65187649068704
I am not so      selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.:22.8993603106452
Adieu.:625.136041338345
I      take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,      but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging      you all to come here, as soon as possible.:13.042836724771895
My father is going to      London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her.:16.489403485787253
In such an exigence my uncle's advice and      assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately      comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness."  "Oh!:12.581779852301032
where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and Mr.:13.396374695897629
Darcy appeared.:386.9291755403569
Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.:10.079262662241858
I must find Mr.:71.90807092967376
what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a minute, but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr.:11.476733655134792
You are not well enough;--you cannot go yourself."  Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.:10.773323066597838
On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, "Let me call your maid.:10.403789563740908
"There is nothing the matter with me.:29.978923633441777
I am quite well.:82.72754859978389
I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn."  She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word.:11.281134965027709
At length, she spoke again.:49.70173958021089
"I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news.:21.118722764199077
It cannot be concealed from any one.:36.69521302085674
They are gone off together from Brighton.:22.590605802282777
_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest.:20.757048014723175
She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever."  Darcy was fixed in astonishment.:13.361611043063034
"When I consider," she added, in a yet more agitated voice, "that _I_ might have prevented it!--_I_ who knew what he was.:13.123663365245541
Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family!:17.50479029633922
Had his character been known, this could not have happened.:25.170197468565725
But is it certain, absolutely certain?"  "Oh yes!--They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland."  "And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"  "My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour.:10.911127521305934
But nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done.:23.478087897885572
How are they even to be discovered?:45.60526386591333
I have not the smallest hope.:34.535670647645965
It is every way horrible!"  Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.:9.06141023963259
had I known what I ought, what I dared, to do!:31.854175182158393
Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.:34.978467579454545
Her power was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.:10.890228258615785
But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.:23.489388219203203
Lydia--the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern.:9.98476229825108
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress.--But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.:9.41997771964671
Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy.:21.19924346927553
Say that urgent business calls us home immediately.:11.143175788169009
Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible.--I know it cannot be long."  He readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting, look, went away.:9.76057111770994
As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.:7.979151271293051
But if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment.:8.749613374740397
Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business.:11.362748179402768
Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her.:14.101725092642203
No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation.:22.182261210077435
Surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement.:31.597522523831188
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared incomprehensible.:10.070759831454444
But now it was all too natural.:38.21329429909684
For such an attachment as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.:9.050021177743112
She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body.:13.665873628528201
Sometimes one officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion.:13.458197891126472
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--Oh!:12.56465277237369
how acutely did she now feel it.:25.163555391513444
She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience was severe.:12.375429969198374
Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing, by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr.:9.181311879560065
Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power.--Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled.:8.577830021580514
"But what is to be done about Pemberley?" cried Mrs.:18.71849508696232
"John told us Mr.:38.384594671906726
Darcy was here when you sent for us;--was it so?"  "Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.:12.007143614106974
_That_ is all settled."  "That is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare.:14.179670951153488
"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth!:17.06984536484118
Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure.:11.043780086311736
An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.:20.262587793732983
"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter.:13.739514847507639
It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best.:11.271026910006558
Could he expect that her friends would not step forward?:27.10937765430695
Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?:18.98854004930212
His temptation is not adequate to the risk."  "Do you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.:15.731104795919235
"Upon my word," said Mrs.:22.72644838497716
Gardiner, "I begin to be of your uncle's opinion.:26.997416924622353
It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of it.:14.973789227072267
I cannot think so very ill of Wickham.:37.16555522998748
Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?"  "Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest.:15.873021580889422
If, indeed, it should be so!:50.68651314869862
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption!:13.893234528931133
And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road."  "Well, then--supposing them to be in London.:17.0569650570666
They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose.:22.483153241607504
It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland."  "But why all this secrecy?:10.14210130682995
Why any fear of detection?:27.636426487766066
Why must their marriage be private?:21.372338113728365
His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her.:19.389457027968792
He cannot afford it.:63.721153538858104
And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?:10.212578857576007
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.:11.351868087289812
But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.:21.24414953828657
Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter."  "But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?"  "It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt.:12.154537313416212
But, really, I know not what to say.:37.523784997491404
Perhaps I am not doing her justice.:25.478315768810806
But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity.:13.365017935858273
She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.:13.30978968895444
Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers, have been in her head.:13.572988256796991
She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater--what shall I call it?:12.454307994477935
susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough.:13.876217891718754
And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them?:14.946090990274065
But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is.:21.34675158110381
We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word.:25.018447965000636
That he is as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating."  "And do you really know all this?" cried Mrs.:13.616207542605737
Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.:19.31638968651986
"I do, indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring.:27.93743535375578
"I told you the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr.:25.237947073847188
Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him.:12.757085293836864
And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.:12.151861435726918
From what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl.:13.967651858518224
Yet he knew to the contrary himself.:39.62332439491478
He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her."  "But does Lydia know nothing of this?:15.875439082706956
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?"  "Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all.:15.815961768190949
Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr.:26.282113153055274
Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself.:23.38563098427641
As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?:12.280305162324026
And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs.:21.427532053027555
Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.:14.750247701926007
That _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.:19.564848727771093
That such a consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts."  "When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other."  "Not the slightest.:11.997046907620307
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away.:12.91784977116067
When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were.:15.498463613539133
Every girl in, or near Meryton, was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites."         *       *       *       *       *  It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey.:9.759463863993135
From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.:35.460216133805496
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.:9.514707022386931
They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day.:9.93331253165906
It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations.:16.49330650073371
The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.:10.344305527773344
Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.:10.20649885146746
Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives.:11.330126316768236
"Not yet," replied Jane.:57.59444193852011
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do.:13.897867630471692
He merely added, that he should not write again, till he had something of importance to mention."  "And my mother--How is she?:15.760553372125681
How are you all?"  "My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken.:17.011877745743206
She is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all.:26.68806345371758
She does not yet leave her dressing-room.:26.15759639423475
Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven!:20.259911880302017
are quite well."  "But you--How are you?" cried Elizabeth.:20.339650560970757
"You look pale.:81.19545595508845
How much you must have gone through!"  Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr.:16.531265092143038
Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of the whole party.:16.419094989649448
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.:14.043819717884814
When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give.:15.105725932660496
The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.:12.102828838526596
Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing.:7.497749081176195
"If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to Brighton, with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her.:13.288365892127292
Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight?:14.228242934941028
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after.:14.79630463116433
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am.:16.99172405568576
Poor dear child!:63.392084369738754
And now here's Mr.:58.0297378663318
Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all?:15.855993641517816
The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do."  They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr.:11.708287296067228
Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.:15.69735007615185
Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.:23.131294615244855
"Do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.:15.676551509692812
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.:22.177138823908848
In a few days more, we may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost.:14.06621728992113
As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be done."  "Oh!:13.830515308736388
my dear brother," replied Mrs.:35.887195549204655
Bennet, "that is exactly what I could most wish for.:20.382615124275144
And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them marry.:12.350792225111386
And, above all things, keep Mr.:24.870945164134973
Bennet from fighting.:92.69906876067645
And tell my dear Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.:15.49373364273139
Oh, brother, how kind you are!:32.25771518995196
I know you will contrive it all."  But Mr.:24.821893708799745
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before.:10.930743899404934
One came from her books, and the other from her toilette.:27.984804803158532
The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty.:11.817958307064977
As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,  "This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.:13.934911313773867
But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other, the balm of sisterly consolation."  Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, "Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."  Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply.:8.066146525813005
Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.:11.828685462924467
In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy.:12.233908711096104
Give me farther particulars.:45.59997859956126
What did Colonel Forster say?:49.04555871646106
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place?:20.119854672741134
They must have seen them together for ever."  "Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm.:12.838106547520333
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.:31.653312358162516
He _was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey."  "And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?:11.681207051210494
Did he know of their intending to go off?:31.54935602944709
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"  "Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it.:10.961288598853688
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."  "And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?"  "How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains!:11.223500824848808
I felt a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right.:16.271161239916136
My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how imprudent a match it must be.:14.138839989200637
Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter, she had prepared her for such a step.:13.5382682566762
She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks."  "But not before they went to Brighton?"  "No, I believe not."  "And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself?:15.081160561004536
Does he know his real character?"  "I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did.:14.380888632000016
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.:35.27442487713151
And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said, that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false."  "Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!"  "Perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister.:10.90680380527671
"But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.:13.053202807024483
We acted with the best intentions."  "Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife?"  "He brought it with him for us to see."  Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.:13.174868052085976
These were the contents:       "MY DEAR HARRIET,       "You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help      laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am      missed.:13.129868927774487
I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with      who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the      world I love, and he is an angel.:13.49764854260609
I should never be happy without      him, so think it no harm to be off.:23.259556983607997
You need not send them word at      Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the      surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia      Wickham.:14.440368766303083
What a good joke it will be!:38.641990802643505
I can hardly write for      laughing.:31.57301833802319
Pray make my excuses to Pratt, for not keeping my      engagement, and dancing with him to-night.:12.482174397236982
Tell him I hope he will      excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at      the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.:14.883652032284829
I shall send for my      clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally      to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are      packed up.:10.764114589176891
Good bye.:286.2658517214794
Give my love to Colonel Forster, I hope you      will drink to our good journey.:14.935915601111022
"Your affectionate friend,       "LYDIA BENNET."  "Oh!:24.932786889849268
thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!" cried Elizabeth when she had finished it.:11.975521669746355
But at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.:21.533726120993038
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy.:14.19670800626557
My poor father!:125.82374794863627
how he must have felt it!"  "I never saw any one so shocked.:19.702476870094024
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes.:20.705012768675985
My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!"  "Oh!:16.53159773249053
Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"  "I do not know.--I hope there was.--But to be guarded at such a time, is very difficult.:15.031031697001644
My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done!:14.98493952738308
But the horror of what might possibly happen, almost took from me my faculties."  "Your attendance upon her, has been too much for you.:11.430928307831813
You do not look well.:58.540936000980125
that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone."  "Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.:12.57439213080661
Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on.:12.081994535010883
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me.:16.34740650626016
Assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable.:13.297504873587105
Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."  She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.:12.336764730046665
His principal object must be, to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham.:16.10403375767527
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this."     CHAPTER VI.:13.178935163170362
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr.:27.11722553918799
Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.:13.087802708326274
They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain.:14.508548329860186
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.:17.387335460203076
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr.:13.7164146411492
Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.:17.062122564694135
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces.:15.177565272767247
Bennet, and was a great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom.:25.76743081676181
Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.:8.788031593500412
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light.:12.250774720552398
Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.:15.414275541903747
Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street.:13.239982918175965
That Mr.:160.66427110098635
Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr.:12.103959476276223
Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings.:17.18163609394227
Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.:12.481373200618041
He added, that Mr.:55.209842612763524
Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and promised to write again very soon.:16.927873612768455
There was also a postscript to this effect.:17.915920482473595
"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself.:12.934314539048824
If there were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.:16.578954252258285
At present we have nothing to guide us.:28.3281935775961
Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head.:14.232396769294295
But, on second thoughts, perhaps Lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better than any other person."  Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved.:10.075990972199298
She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years.:14.864567362515054
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected.:16.822842827254206
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience.:22.43079538378429
Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.:10.934377812670434
But before they heard again from Mr.:23.388315231503572
Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr.:19.56835557537189
Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.:12.57192465013464
It was as follows:       "MY DEAR SIR,       "I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation      in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now      suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter      from Hertfordshire.:10.92850723897615
Collins and      myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable      family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest      kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.:12.928214366848831
The death      of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.:20.96499997979689
And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to      suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness      of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree      of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of      yourself and Mrs.:12.655331533145711
Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own      disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of      such an enormity, at so early an age.:13.055264183726848
Howsoever that may be, you      are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined      by Mrs.:13.97907612809713
Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter,      to whom I have related the affair.:20.156296477499566
They agree with me in      apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be      injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady      Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves      with such a family.:11.794425257292636
And this consideration leads me moreover to      reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last      November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in      all your sorrow and disgrace.:8.867115763005309
Let me advise you then, my dear Sir,      to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy      child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the      fruits of her own heinous offence.:10.203649104874513
"I am, dear Sir, &c.:22.075139908752742
Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.:19.34984334928924
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living.:13.853686503027221
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out, as likely to give any news of him.:16.7046375372953
And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable amount.:12.224132855124624
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton.:10.22517947136205
He owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.:20.087516723282413
"A gamester!" she cried.:31.111238188118485
"This is wholly unexpected.:47.11980937737548
I had not an idea of it."  Mr.:33.925360324348155
Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.:19.94493714506283
Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit.:11.50139264370823
Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.:14.915094781096021
"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia!" she cried.:18.69166723638243
"Sure he will not leave London before he has found them.:23.35745995687467
Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?"  As Mrs.:17.08571546532121
Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr.:15.448193852562044
Bennet came from it.:80.44508036109441
The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.:14.999455863696436
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.:16.68550986410171
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs.:12.646699761647731
Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.:16.140734516616174
Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from Pemberley.:16.710170678080775
The present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware, that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better.:11.7995440614412
It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.:19.1231661839458
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.:13.9721966048871
It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "Say nothing of that.:12.545383657248745
Who should suffer but myself?:36.77707339057254
It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it."  "You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth.:17.845172314452075
"You may well warn me against such an evil.:21.05322667713974
Human nature is so prone to fall into it!:12.188234321654143
No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame.:18.14520251168033
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.:24.223712871960295
It will pass away soon enough."  "Do you suppose them to be in London?"  "Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"  "And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty.:12.664917194835793
"She is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there will probably be of some duration."  Then, after a short silence, he continued, "Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shews some greatness of mind."  They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea.:10.429516522946274
"This is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune!:12.638509264101778
Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can,--or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away."  "I am not going to run away, Papa," said Kitty, fretfully; "if _I_ should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia."  "_You_ go to Brighton!--I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne for fifty pounds!:9.735211814072809
Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.:12.21602823396211
"Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy.:21.456910885928718
If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them."     CHAPTER VII.:16.21561055251
Two days after Mr.:42.62153549771195
Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask."  "What do you mean, Hill?:11.094044386488745
We have heard nothing from town."  "Dear madam," cried Mrs.:17.36891064949062
Hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr.:12.35392373135404
Gardiner?:2333.662661780994
He has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter."  Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.:11.40029022470329
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said,  "If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the little copse."  Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.:9.346409208907067
what news?:412.9174761068368
Jane now came up.:48.89656460395764
"MY DEAR BROTHER,       "At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such      as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction.:17.373002292616796
Soon after      you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what      part of London they were.:15.820441369565309
The particulars, I reserve till we meet.:39.246766866099584
It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them      both----"  "Then it is, as I always hoped," cried Jane; "they are married!"       Elizabeth read on; "I have seen them both.:14.435599383865931
These are conditions, which,      considering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as      far as I thought myself privileged, for you.:14.038628647492931
I shall send this by      express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.:10.98342686208222
You      will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr.:19.533012613391502
Wickham's      circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to      be.:18.838877389500695
The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to      say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are      discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.:14.587873497305473
If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act      in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will      immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper      settlement.:9.496280901695448
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming      to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on      my diligence and care.:14.054052320785344
Send back your answer as soon as you can,      and be careful to write explicitly.:13.769049955946898
We have judged it best, that my      niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will      approve.:17.258172101706506
She comes to us to-day.:48.14174026859248
I shall write again as soon as any      thing more is determined on.:17.397815403436933
"EDW.:527.003414727092
GARDINER."  "Is it possible!" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.:24.96090527954415
"Can it be possible that he will marry her?"  "Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her sister.:16.845078565402318
"My dear father, I congratulate you."  "And have you answered the letter?" said Elizabeth.:18.866785229920435
"No; but it must be done soon."  Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote.:14.76968697292659
my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately.:20.144695277762036
"And may I ask?" said Elizabeth, "but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with."  "Complied with!:17.525276185629217
Yet he is _such_ a man!"  "Yes, yes, they must marry.:21.111525805543373
There is nothing else to be done.:38.90807181831612
But there are two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever to pay him."  "Money!:13.982026764371028
my uncle!" cried Jane, "what do you mean, Sir?"  "I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after I am gone."  "That is very true," said Elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me before.:11.45470330922996
it must be my uncle's doings!:38.926281388108976
A small sum could not do all this."  "No," said her father, "Wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds.:14.288383705665929
I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship."  "Ten thousand pounds!:17.684599416343012
Heaven forbid!:94.82827527279393
How is half such a sum to be repaid?"  Mr.:18.97851353457803
Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house.:12.037924787211058
Their father then went to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.:15.87156409175332
"And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves.:22.30841458872206
"How strange this is!:68.60284598399826
And for _this_ we are to be thankful.:42.42587402646794
That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice!:12.436284079570326
Oh, Lydia!"  "I comfort myself with thinking," replied Jane, "that he certainly would not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her.:15.111116041492398
He has children of his own, and may have more.:34.402967543239626
How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?"  "If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been," said Elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr.:10.908254350979908
Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own.:23.293314375097204
Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.:12.400729967372865
By this time she is actually with them!:35.97852430109749
What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!"  "We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said Jane: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy.:11.036356458204127
His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking.:18.46388641927927
It is useless to talk of it."  It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.:15.102075076761809
They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to make it known to her.:18.78493795880153
He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied,  "Just as you please."  "May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"  "Take whatever you like, and get away."  Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up stairs together.:13.121936315894015
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs.:16.968405254931213
Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all.:19.87371152639565
After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud.:17.291007946404452
Bennet could hardly contain herself.:38.931547600749674
As soon as Jane had read Mr.:28.249148355615734
Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance.:12.075811206689737
To know that her daughter would be married was enough.:41.5300587005604
"My dear, dear Lydia!" she cried: "This is delightful indeed!--She will be married!--I shall see her again!--She will be married at sixteen!--My good, kind brother!--I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage every thing.:10.381365582079189
How I long to see her!:36.74472320916869
and to see dear Wickham too!:62.45057578130895
Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her.:19.11194355881048
Stay, stay, I will go myself.:26.770784303719736
Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill.:19.99937842414296
My dear, dear Lydia!--How merry we shall be together when we meet!"  Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.:8.655078853473073
Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.:21.57852481870877
"For we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great measure, to his kindness.:17.56919352425455
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr.:19.564695145852752
Wickham with money."  "Well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle?:12.70493892624005
If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him, except a few presents.:17.228896483262947
Well!:2709.1250461952814
In a short time, I shall have a daughter married.:34.28304190890486
Wickham!:2431.105097033135
And she was only sixteen last June.:32.51605128726664
My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you write for me.:14.474651405846094
We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."  She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her father was at leisure to be consulted.:10.36306733407372
One day's delay she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite so obstinate as usual.:16.951012694588627
Other schemes too came into her head.:23.91521988498601
"I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips.:16.593053911518403
And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs.:24.178601479496674
Kitty, run down and order the carriage.:16.034896369552104
Girls, can I do any thing for you in Meryton?:34.814493861947994
here comes Hill.:69.82891594148944
My dear Hill, have you heard the good news?:23.875089755326577
Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding."  Mrs.:12.917878480659207
Hill began instantly to express her joy.:16.136057505578282
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.:12.494032981796193
Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him.:12.837284062749637
He now wished it more than ever.:40.46955529222975
Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her.:12.103251128257734
The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.:10.074480972173795
He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.:12.895191173825529
When first Mr.:95.6820082913127
Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son.:16.017595600942574
This son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for.:9.489305399715018
Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.:15.531402594344009
Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he would.:23.33865980448287
This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving.:17.315314182723526
Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.:10.109050985780806
Bennet and the children.:145.59029301454427
But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter, depended on the will of the parents.:15.627909550432552
This was one point, with regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr.:20.46119512800429
Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.:19.37226916208227
In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him.:10.364162465101744
He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present arrangement.:15.605826849465267
He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her, through her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within that sum.:10.150232708051302
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to have as little trouble in the business as possible.:13.651872438680622
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.:10.464295463389384
His letter was soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution.:12.923177642989069
He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any message to her.:18.070119785400856
The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood.:16.548603469403567
It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy.:23.910795893271224
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm house.:12.659542602640695
But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her misery was considered certain.:12.8416431158317
It was a fortnight since Mrs.:37.79813445493129
No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph.:19.073108586261498
The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants.:12.608090123954305
She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.:10.03203421547528
"Haye-Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings would quit it, or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off!:8.97908447105458
I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."  Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the servants remained.:11.29934350922623
But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "Mrs.:33.602507815871455
Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding.:14.878239891833488
Into _one_ house in this neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance.:22.127578930988363
I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn."  A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr.:10.922049510134046
Bennet was firm: it soon led to another; and Mrs.:14.756929164838708
Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter.:12.737829585439655
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever, on the occasion.:13.536317314341732
Bennet could hardly comprehend it.:36.723678348661664
That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible.:9.534447849940078
She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they took place.:11.71784735080622
Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the spot.:11.62413384363714
She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means.:15.881090493337497
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much.:12.55259189736287
Not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them.:12.091596476651084
Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr.:15.581797709973497
Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.:11.874451456348854
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.:25.52531780273071
The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this.:13.40835811758956
She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.:18.071423815304414
She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it.:20.839739529755573
She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.:21.763689738581743
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they should meet.:19.777401679231957
What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been gladly and gratefully received!:12.035993952795575
He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex.:26.659719811717068
But while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.:30.820105684214383
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her.:14.363103257758988
His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.:20.247186880005334
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved, and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.:13.597764163190968
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was.:7.309774736597378
An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.:21.028299923171666
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine.:17.839957844904003
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.:8.186824052730655
*       *       *       *       *  Mr.:11.871595344547377
Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.:30.984624914802875
Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.:13.13483065621343
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr.:26.687618006248776
Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia.:19.537148782014746
"It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon      as his marriage was fixed on.:14.658710621764593
Wickham's intention to go      into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still      some who are able and willing to assist him in the army.:10.817173104952033
He has the      promise of an ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in      the North.:13.608487337857404
He promises fairly, and I hope among different people,      where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be      more prudent.:11.707457273079235
I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of      our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the      various creditors of Mr.:12.020271621492682
Wickham in and near Brighton, with      assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself.:12.90974741438483
And      will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances      to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list,      according to his information.:10.457042340099493
He has given in all his debts; I hope      at least he has not deceived us.:18.524028599244648
They will then join his regiment,      unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from      Mrs.:13.54944878989561
Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all,      before she leaves the South.:15.111319122754761
She is well, and begs to be dutifully      remembered to you and her mother.--Your's, &c.:18.799460933508062
"E.:533.4308250222176
Gardiner could do.:97.9538622772371
Bennet, was not so well pleased with it.:43.05017452032987
Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body, and had so many favourites.:11.86461268500029
"She is so fond of Mrs.:40.22427157549342
Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking to send her away!:14.878716201100657
And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much.:21.722485663652183
The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----'s regiment."  His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again, before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative.:12.08770856223449
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to the North.:16.756712447950353
Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn.:15.004074146755114
Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.:15.344000967945865
Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself.:18.73517079027723
The carriage was sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time.:16.517534757356362
Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets; and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_ been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.:12.679510534939041
They came.:448.01698929179645
The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive them.:36.068200091647334
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room.:13.833017282550646
Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.:9.84937130034812
Their reception from Mr.:45.97638239279373
Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial.:20.902711631849947
His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips.:14.369149294559925
The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him.:22.327378052185168
Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked.:31.784202893087542
Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless.:8.622087161146247
She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.:11.977808814300555
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.:12.968292563786912
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man.:11.271689190737153
There was no want of discourse.:31.91251469446444
"Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time.:14.28496836653232
Good gracious!:191.53059404608595
when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again!:16.68875018525583
though I thought it would be very good fun if I was."  Her father lifted up his eyes.:19.161103121824855
Jane was distressed.:98.28010731641726
Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "Oh!:12.889944923277174
mamma, do the people here abouts know I am married to-day?:12.825723191344327
I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like any thing."  Elizabeth could bear it no longer.:10.201467927332054
She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour.:16.514301288163207
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, "Ah!:15.427216673077034
Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman."  It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment, from which she had been so wholly free at first.:11.614574291438123
Her ease and good spirits increased.:42.078869113394255
She longed to see Mrs.:66.98070444752467
Philips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs.:18.153689550767886
Wickham," by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married, to Mrs.:12.586393699383285
Hill and the two housemaids.:47.42408834929116
Is not he a charming man?:33.04838182622713
I am sure my sisters must all envy me.:15.526524944537602
I only hope they may have half my good luck.:21.38352613898358
They must all go to Brighton.:34.712062887706416
That is the place to get husbands.:51.314427762491285
What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."  "Very true; and if I had my will, we should.:18.63977124741514
But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a way off.:20.47576272506478
Must it be so?"  "Oh, lord!:28.703273853956663
yes;--there is nothing in that.:38.766714952040886
I shall like it of all things.:49.44284211456216
You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.:23.598385584482283
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all."  "I should like it beyond any thing!" said her mother.:11.829092218006295
"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over."  "I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands."  Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.:10.716603017528005
Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.:16.30495185782426
No one but Mrs.:55.059525796217905
Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.:15.259314728592374
Wickham's affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him.:16.58572203092627
She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.:11.403729005684177
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him.:37.98833280660241
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.:14.348300664433241
One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,  "Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe.:15.734381045781591
You were not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it.:23.062889713077404
Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"  "No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too little said on the subject."  "La!:13.768195910553583
You are so strange!:80.32893304293924
But I must tell you how it went off.:23.20271222633318
We were married, you know, at St.:34.718411085596124
Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish.:19.273446233367448
And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock.:11.597957284677676
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church.:20.555159875289142
Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss!:22.390475503400687
I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.:14.513562306046822
And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon.:15.460403778144293
However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham.:16.386874199444303
I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.:28.411684310004567
"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them.:12.292842853124046
If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight.:12.07291018684552
Not one party, or scheme, or any thing.:37.538034792792104
Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr.:13.727631097299197
Stone.:395.4128887468083
And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it.:19.648195806786834
Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day.:17.2707208733178
But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.:17.90996347403484
However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr.:15.27059838474176
Darcy might have done as well."  "Mr.:29.62941803714432
Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.:39.106275801153856
"Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know.:22.11315196850394
I quite forgot!:158.12924927304712
I ought not to have said a word about it.:29.8785261169309
I promised them so faithfully!:44.40516852088478
What will Wickham say?:53.91898117219878
It was to be such a secret!"  "If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the subject.:18.06991593909311
certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will ask you no questions."  "Thank you," said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry."  On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.:12.308967153876273
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information.:13.412562124815008
It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.:15.967015862771953
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none.:12.070155836920994
"You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time.:11.614132818993735
Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance."  "Not that I _shall_ though," she added to herself, as she finished the letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out."  Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.:9.983919443479543
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as soon as she possibly could.:18.639427640051537
"MY DEAR NIECE,       "I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole      morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will      not comprise what I have to tell you.:11.11645794127896
Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,      that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_      side.:9.72815200812896
If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my      impertinence.:16.890541613130694
But if you are really innocent and      ignorant, I must be more explicit.:21.94014484465026
Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.:26.23553593779357
It was all      over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked      as _your's_ seems to have been.:9.963321728195531
He came to tell Mr.:64.3957528033231
Gardiner that      he had found out where your sister and Mr.:18.635678771368777
Wickham were, and that      he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia      once.:16.64108812969245
He generously imputed the whole to his      mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath      him, to lay his private actions open to the world.:13.992255746449613
His character      was to speak for itself.:45.962578573378124
He called it, therefore, his duty to step      forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on      by himself.:15.913594704313157
If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never      disgrace him.:14.219260111655313
He had been some days in town, before he was able to      discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was      more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another      reason for his resolving to follow us.:13.00818947274616
There is a lady, it seems, a      Mrs.:32.66445697381336
Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was      dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though      he did not say what.:11.254108279284143
She then took a large house in Edward-street,      and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.:10.574465928990616
This Mrs.:354.3612906616003
Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he      went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town.:16.198051664061545
Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in      London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they      would have taken up their abode with her.:14.427019287801896
At length, however, our      kind friend procured the wished-for direction.:8.694805943102269
They were in ----      street.:38.10490413942285
He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.:24.746469617270645
His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade      her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her      friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,      offering his assistance, as far as it would go.:15.605044621522325
But he found Lydia      absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.:16.74291158046823
She cared for none      of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of      leaving Wickham.:19.574988829117494
She was sure they should be married some time or      other, and it did not much signify when.:18.609274936054337
Since such were her      feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a      marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he      easily learnt, had never been _his_ design.:14.476049462583305
He confessed himself      obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,      which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the      ill-consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone.:12.793959839786067
He must go      somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have      nothing to live on.:21.103509505395767
Darcy asked him why he had not married your      sister at once.:21.269961399648373
Though Mr.:272.7311924279673
Bennet was not imagined to be very rich,      he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation      must have been benefited by marriage.:16.998910385415115
But he found, in reply to      this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more      effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.:13.845714688907526
Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof      against the temptation of immediate relief.:12.602569807734573
They met several times,      for there was much to be discussed.:26.880479436897375
Wickham of course wanted more      than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.:18.695841819589393
Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr.:15.484255299651245
Darcy's next step was      to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in      Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home.:12.338978303717015
Gardiner      could not be seen, and Mr.:34.952741617214215
Darcy found, on further enquiry, that      your father was still with him, but would quit town the next      morning.:16.074481654492764
He did not      leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a      gentleman had called on business.:16.513868802870622
On Saturday he came again.:47.29990278960844
Your      father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they      had a great deal of talk together.:18.407579817379744
They met again on Sunday, and      then _I_ saw him too.:22.381209347179592
It was not all settled before Monday: as soon      as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn.:14.177681707121675
I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real      defect of his character after all.:23.02628937540224
He has been accused of many      faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one.:11.673316420726325
Nothing was      to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do      not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your      uncle would most readily have settled the whole.:12.166779299318147
They battled it      together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman      or lady concerned in it deserved.:14.889601868449873
But at last your uncle was forced      to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,      was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,      which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your      letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an      explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give      the praise where it was due.:10.462281568346722
But, Lizzy, this must go no farther      than yourself, or Jane at most.:16.399881405028115
You know pretty well, I suppose,      what has been done for the young people.:22.018842067327306
His debts are to be paid,      amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,      another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his      commission purchased.:12.29554268796145
The reason why all this was to be done by him      alone, was such as I have given above.:23.89838780360458
It was owing to him, to his      reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character      had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been      received and noticed as he was.:16.522476641473325
Perhaps there was some truth in      _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_      reserve, can be answerable for the event.:11.199294749271372
But in spite of all this      fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that      your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit      for _another interest_ in the affair.:11.041549327467054
When all this was resolved      on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at      Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more      when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to      receive the last finish.:14.617614518162052
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I      hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.:13.504952519609166
Lydia came to      us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house.:25.14792433934559
_He_ was      exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I      would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour      while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter      last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a      piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no      fresh pain.:11.515277473100069
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,      representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and      all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.:18.95722028489062
If she heard me,      it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen.:20.92038703117114
I was      sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth      and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.:14.061454694456883
He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again      on Wednesday or Thursday.:17.01505310948399
Will you be very angry with me, my dear      Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold      enough to say before) how much I like him.:12.568407718858916
His behaviour to us has,      in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.:15.508087388992532
His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but      a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his      wife may teach him.:12.387039980900143
I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever      mentioned your name.:13.59872392871803
Pray forgive      me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so      far, as to exclude me from P.:13.073934983118793
I shall never be quite happy till I      have been all round the park.:19.446250633314225
A low phaeton, with a nice little      pair of ponies, would be the very thing.:15.411201102670951
But I must write no more.:48.06957402109471
The children have been wanting me this half hour.:26.645411323123135
Your's, very      sincerely,       "M.:38.05483687862496
GARDINER."  The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share.:10.481814160996914
Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!:11.154892325860084
He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.:10.49304598587716
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.:16.787286267213798
Her heart did whisper, that he had done it for her.:24.58737468798786
Brother-in-law of Wickham!:19.861265773107114
Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection.:24.69467091428067
He had to be sure done much.:39.96525040942164
She was ashamed to think how much.:41.87626336247131
But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief.:13.773189737674052
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned.:11.854693391422991
It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return.:15.817784205398599
They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing to him.:22.750523311117725
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him.:9.472125588980935
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.:15.243238354212487
It was hardly enough; but it pleased her.:23.583916081470747
She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr.:9.87600679997512
She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham.:14.452162671277513
"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said he, as he joined her.:10.933442909523874
"You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome."  "I should be sorry indeed, if it were.:15.01144860586193
Are the others coming out?"  "I do not know.:22.143715598123457
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton.:29.963779503861343
And so, my dear sister, I find from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley."  She replied in the affirmative.:17.18480713344894
"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.:17.554133564078242
And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?:37.981090759840214
Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me.:24.39183952437792
But of course she did not mention my name to you."  "Yes, she did."  "And what did she say?"  "That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned out well.:13.369570636425156
At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely misrepresented."  "Certainly," he replied, biting his lips.:10.919475668226607
Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,  "I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.:15.90530343263269
We passed each other several times.:34.51290133988637
"It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year."  "Undoubtedly.:18.501775530084323
Did you see him while you were at Lambton?:27.954467977250644
I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had."  "Yes; he introduced us to his sister."  "And do you like her?"  "Very much."  "I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two.:14.087356745548893
When I last saw her, she was not very promising.:26.603873964213037
I am very glad you liked her.:25.026864020921828
A most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House!:15.487293686839894
It would have suited me in every respect."  "How should you have liked making sermons?"  "Exceedingly well.:14.09181691356185
I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing.:19.768374378116185
One ought not to repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me!:22.085831894491076
The quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of happiness!:22.111085477444114
But it was not to be.:59.58164462065994
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?"  "I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."  "You have.:12.109991837160171
Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the first, you may remember."  "I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly."  "You did!:12.638044159555422
and it was not wholly without foundation.:35.728463844097924
You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it."  They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,  "Come, Mr.:13.509790893958932
Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.:28.882148048181737
Do not let us quarrel about the past.:25.012819506508233
In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind."  She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.:12.463556345561788
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs.:22.33025021143405
Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.:12.40139602222188
my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"  "Oh, lord!:14.010502775092002
I don't know.:43.83727488274147
Not these two or three years perhaps."  "Write to me very often, my dear."  "As often as I can.:20.6828631169791
My sisters may write to _me_.:30.1207463502138
They will have nothing else to do."  Mr.:26.385125002895705
Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's.:15.794581981993538
"He is as fine a fellow," said Mr.:19.797820862674453
He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all.:31.906065674700464
I am prodigiously proud of him.:33.59289779003368
I defy even Sir William Lucas himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law."  The loss of her daughter made Mrs.:11.755662759185993
Bennet very dull for several days.:23.799259315072764
One seems so forlorn without them."  "This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said Elizabeth.:11.771741136344467
"It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single."  "It is no such thing.:13.34078156490451
If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."  But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news, which then began to be in circulation.:13.128210497389315
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.:13.343328698114963
Bennet was quite in the fidgets.:59.77873349370249
She looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.:23.66609021793089
"Well, well, and so Mr.:43.887474324188915
Bingley is coming down, sister," (for Mrs.:15.69379917528132
Philips first brought her the news.) "Well, so much the better.:13.690378675631523
Not that I care about it, though.:62.62385881802797
He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure _I_ never want to see him again.:17.91643981365118
But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it.:19.86840163712724
But that is nothing to us.:66.30936305731082
You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it.:16.461899948184655
And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"  "You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs.:19.08363056491128
He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday.:15.142470867460782
She was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be killed."  Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing colour.:12.367363350451512
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,  "I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed.:14.6800249387891
But don't imagine it was from any silly cause.:19.355693950396773
I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I _should_ be looked at.:21.926910345844902
I do assure you, that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain.:15.52625193768889
I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.:14.670978500757618
Not that I am afraid of _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks."  Elizabeth did not know what to make of it.:15.134802623771229
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it.:12.145733100981403
"Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation!:14.288625389409134
I _will_ leave him to himself."  In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it.:17.737306395581385
They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.:15.12175806181333
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.:12.183007726674475
"As soon as ever Mr.:40.29239700640882
Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs.:20.236301407769453
Bennet, "you will wait on him of course."  "No, no.:25.27975505308894
You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.:18.081376234747317
"'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he.:9.95547161399038
"If he wants our society, let him seek it.:18.857395771718082
He knows where we live.:53.522625240526274
But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined.:15.886002211285126
Long and the Gouldings soon.:59.02501093952078
That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him."  Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr.:10.643647885985782
Bingley in consequence of it, before _they_ did.:31.07211706359461
As the day of his arrival drew near,  "I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her sister.:20.711118760415992
My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know how much I suffer from what she says.:17.25646146205242
Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!"  "I wish I could say any thing to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but it is wholly out of my power.:14.020000136178618
You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much."  Mr.:14.113243282141047
Bingley arrived.:356.7234685569227
Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could.:11.402649481321808
She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before.:9.626605629117263
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.:13.308379586864524
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.:17.76942655411791
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr.:14.405858779090549
Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.:32.490870226683406
"There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be?"  "Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know."  "La!" replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with him before.:12.863736047197118
what's his name.:92.60791742584587
That tall, proud man."  "Good gracious!:24.62170840284519
Darcy!--and so it does I vow.:30.53821004880036
Well, any friend of Mr.:27.46610003122226
Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him."  Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.:13.56841944870314
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter.:12.308120849115575
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.:31.292394341471486
Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr.:23.52169867425266
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.:11.856576535968998
Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.:16.015793280905662
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what Jane felt for Bingley.:13.372281297495618
Her astonishment at his coming--at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.:13.275375822293631
But she would not be secure.:59.831499496448
"Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early enough for expectation."  She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister, as the servant was approaching the door.:9.942564856279985
Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected.:15.006938710097225
On the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.:10.062078336914608
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.:15.09963285801005
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.:22.8553407226539
He looked serious as usual; and she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley.:15.731454047922021
It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.:19.828389171034797
Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.:11.927065130629579
He was received by Mrs.:42.979937746570315
Bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.:12.62493992297546
Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.:10.72533252026627
Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr.:32.42140102533691
Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.:17.05895796452949
He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.:20.983568750536108
There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself.:37.36078818409031
More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please than when they last met, were plainly expressed.:16.180245551357736
She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.:26.88472163617693
"Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said she.:27.40494827406101
"Yet why did he come?"  She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.:14.745540894952454
She enquired after his sister, but could do no more.:37.193423113316626
Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs.:19.050005923108202
He readily agreed to it.:56.53420490594158
"I began to be afraid you would never come back again.:30.64357057299008
People _did_ say, you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true.:13.77202081181789
Miss Lucas is married and settled.:19.915394179935625
I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers.:25.471232554252826
It was only said, 'Lately, George Wickham, Esq.:17.085194931520935
Did you see it?"  Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.:18.14146731624158
Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes.:23.619485658644756
How Mr.:193.33639076858418
Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.:32.481345620191995
"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married," continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr.:14.910459302151363
Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me.:18.961567208289473
They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not know how long.:16.05782709427668
His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.:18.391872446719862
he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves."  Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr.:16.53948362955856
It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present.:15.046639496123632
A few weeks, he believed.:57.70566846114848
"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr.:18.87480486024817
Bingley," said her mother, "I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr.:14.696798778354424
Bennet's manor.:71.13849801515798
I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you."  Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention!:12.325124429720097
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.:12.305510234415287
At that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for moments of such painful confusion.:13.67986706958115
"The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be in company with either of them.:21.00975992020024
Their society can afford no pleasure, that will atone for such wretchedness as this!:16.866001673263355
When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.:19.348727608691746
He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty.:15.329494247037086
When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs.:21.97129686098721
Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time.:14.126745254813072
"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr.:20.001030930431888
They then went away.:67.91813776374666
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year.:11.130852268444844
As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more.:9.08308979524454
Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.:17.704495067543643
"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she, "did he come at all?"  She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.:14.300131709878052
"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?:22.28864170081618
If he fears me, why come hither?:23.623154836516285
Teazing, teazing, man!:18.08452752126324
I will think no more about him."  Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.:13.740554888978666
"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy.:14.279302145577638
I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming.:24.79803084576302
I am glad he dines here on Tuesday.:17.119476797902806
It will then be publicly seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance."  "Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly.:9.961566787170197
Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived.:16.26322044753607
When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.:13.57383896785816
He placed himself by her.:59.75025581846378
Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.:14.62965306285252
He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr.:11.980072877906611
His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured.:13.303467657465454
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.:14.55946718881982
Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table could divide them.:24.342845222508313
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage.:15.965864483923683
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner, whenever they did.:12.388665031554595
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.:11.526075380467075
Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her uncivil.:12.651168077592063
"If he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "I shall give him up for ever."  The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas!:13.024912691024076
the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her, which would admit of a chair.:11.895196924094552
We want none of them; do we?"  Darcy had walked away to another part of the room.:13.405181048543595
She followed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!:11.919807695797294
"A man who has once been refused!:24.09815227684867
How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love?:18.763686143537416
Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?:15.20497983848604
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"  She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,  "Is your sister at Pemberley still?"  "Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."  "And quite alone?:9.397141345014585
Have all her friends left her?"  "Mrs.:33.15018911425771
The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks."  She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success.:13.583393128573796
He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.:23.568362126661732
When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party.:10.461241695326505
She now lost every expectation of pleasure.:30.136830449813026
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.:10.870708173781622
"Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "What say you to the day?:20.135010120424795
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw.:25.04116271934964
The venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat a haunch.:13.471465164875184
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas's last week; and even Mr.:16.5833203645216
Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least.:13.03120177451082
And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty.:20.099446981458684
Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not.:19.58677897132869
And what do you think she said besides?:40.62316781758253
'Ah!:398.42559758613004
Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.' She did indeed.:21.794768674756845
I do think Mrs.:62.81780065440443
Long is as good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously."  Mrs.:9.898439721932808
Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.:14.14203705754811
"The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.:19.893566360080822
I hope we may often meet again."  Elizabeth smiled.:24.11085784029627
"Lizzy, you must not do so.:41.31225253080509
You must not suspect me.:43.293593871157775
It mortifies me.:132.65777629983643
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.:10.532120730320129
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection.:12.865273945256776
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man."  "You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment."  "How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"  "And how impossible in others!"  "But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?"  "That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.:11.540920192906471
We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.:13.406555584916742
A few days after this visit, Mr.:21.817871004479947
Bingley called again, and alone.:57.89930647564393
His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time.:16.691264538387156
He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits.:18.94689427185235
"Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky."  He should be particularly happy at any time, &c.:11.162658430090696
&c.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.:12.2068828106313
"Can you come to-morrow?"  Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.:15.815689505912935
He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them dressed.:26.792495004568988
In ran Mrs.:139.82516961286112
Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,  "My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.:13.821141071632791
He is come--Mr.:34.70271462499929
Make haste, make haste.:33.864819065874805
Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.:16.989732515332268
Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair."  "We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago."  "Oh!:10.99404694797845
what has she to do with it?:54.05774263268435
Come be quick, be quick!:26.132100317746435
where is your sash my dear?"  But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.:14.690967202180312
The same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the evening.:22.331392257184092
After tea, Mr.:47.569428373567206
Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument.:20.14371546892667
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs.:16.32481331430687
Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them.:11.858085871810099
What do you keep winking at me for?:21.958483418384755
What am I to do?"  "Nothing child, nothing.:25.33723691175612
I did not wink at you." She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,  "Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room.:12.643787119630632
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it.:14.337820929628174
In a few minutes, Mrs.:30.456427369768342
"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother as soon as she was in the hall.:17.301537111727338
Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.:19.55044432355363
Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.:15.71550165976414
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.:11.42791729220319
After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.:29.431067778142978
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr.:10.94296258134369
Darcy returned within the stated time.:27.1496596907421
Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence.:14.629256327666791
Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr.:20.694948346979466
Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on.:31.43886581179596
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected.:22.32604804892504
There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him.:11.340494824093701
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs.:23.765204514420493
Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter.:16.979435838114558
Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.:11.519770990077452
But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her.:15.365763863748587
On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would have told it all.:10.158187370109736
_Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she thought was still worse.:8.90305153040785
Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.:12.09425730851273
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.:14.415947694527134
"'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much.:12.69433247624044
why is not every body as happy?"  Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.:11.883408686447206
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.:19.056818266823775
But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said, for the present.:17.425582151649266
"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried.:22.249206038967664
"I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself.:14.930810488209262
He is gone to my father already.:46.2435857642608
Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family!:18.778982961674224
how shall I bear so much happiness!"  She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.:12.388011713888641
Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.:9.306465458751445
"And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection!:20.904609621171787
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance!:30.796463152083184
the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"  In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.:13.672258118784596
"Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door.:20.245305429468345
"With my mother up stairs.:50.65119394321582
She will be down in a moment I dare say."  He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister.:14.653805125895907
They shook hands with great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.:10.939804527502579
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.:11.476872207309064
Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.:13.080188670688258
Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was.:11.575480317522063
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter and said,  "Jane, I congratulate you.:12.996516526069296
You will be a very happy woman."  Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.:18.640160580895767
"You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled.:14.066655930211844
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together.:23.24339504413212
Your tempers are by no means unlike.:22.045286806649916
You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income."  "I hope not so.:12.769147907784985
Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be unpardonable in _me_."  "Exceed their income!:9.008239641793722
My dear Mr.:64.39728482220839
Bennet," cried his wife, "what are you talking of?:22.376775977264565
Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely more." Then addressing her daughter, "Oh!:12.018688404738638
my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy!:24.61589268784621
I knew how it would be.:59.170637335194904
I always said it must be so, at last.:33.55447450062077
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing!:22.359531088919884
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!"  Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.:16.263982740061696
Jane was beyond competition her favourite child.:25.315449427503218
At that moment, she cared for no other.:35.11039519697278
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.:15.613865614742043
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.:13.282093966425824
Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought himself obliged to accept.:9.791129844876224
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur.:11.888215971465737
In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.:16.146101031187413
I had not believed it possible."  "I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth.:20.33475219128091
"But how did he account for it?"  "It must have been his sister's doing.:19.234030945906778
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.:13.49352438682497
But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other."  "That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever heard you utter.:12.650199257308078
"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried Jane.:12.541795775843589
Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all!:14.630445111527015
If I could but see _you_ as happy!:24.989584558317127
If there _were_ but such another man for you!"  "If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you.:13.14960581239708
Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness.:18.868942053997387
No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr.:14.549975114185568
Collins in time."  The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret.:15.059621578892944
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs.:18.358815114481697
Philips, and _she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.:18.08566965662982
One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn.:11.363961108204894
It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.:20.87403906278714
The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.:14.5873742467969
As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery.:14.25290104397881
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh.:34.27445768157316
They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.:15.584642839093409
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.:20.163181812006666
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.:13.213538529807064
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.:16.607759535409066
Bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.:12.3588634056704
After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,  "I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.:16.048012836567874
That lady I suppose is your mother."  Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.:19.728574334253924
"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters."  "Yes, madam," said Mrs.:16.068836171354572
Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine.:32.217797158002355
"She is my youngest girl but one.:30.43847953503587
My youngest of all, is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man, who I believe will soon become a part of the family."  "You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short silence.:11.532968347857954
"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's."  "This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west."  Mrs.:11.367700600876388
Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then added,  "May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr.:11.324603312195906
Collins well."  "Yes, very well.:29.217137058104615
I saw them the night before last."  Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.:14.889336199359722
But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.:24.632024781484365
Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,  "Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn.:11.97836083049699
I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company."  "Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the different walks.:13.226793297628765
I think she will be pleased with the hermitage."  Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest down stairs.:14.247079841183865
As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.:9.510682979012808
Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it.:17.877960006634254
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.:10.900670411023295
"How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in her face.:17.28531002544089
Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come."  Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.:11.671658536575041
"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.:38.143493974434286
I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here."  "Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with.:15.71944581896348
But however insincere _you_ may choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so.:17.443493751418863
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it.:11.019972176574058
A report of a most alarming nature, reached me two days ago.:16.970683156765276
I was told, that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that _you_, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr.:15.113988145180262
Though I _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you."  "If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far.:10.937557425611523
What could your ladyship propose by it?"  "At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."  "Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth, coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence."  "If!:12.271721082215757
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?:33.45813458085837
Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves?:17.43328385600688
Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?"  "I never heard that it was."  "And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?"  "I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.:11.263204681238117
_You_ may ask questions, which _I_ shall not choose to answer."  "This is not to be borne.:14.55628615788194
Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied.:28.947611131919974
Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"  "Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."  "It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason.:13.544513482180804
But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.:12.34779660050556
You may have drawn him in."  "If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it."  "Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?:19.600764610534338
I have not been accustomed to such language as this.:18.6866921557919
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."  "But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit."  "Let me be rightly understood.:10.219003525894223
This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place.:17.0030746011545
No, never.:156.2891291019586
Darcy is engaged to _my daughter_.:24.619375386153
Now what have you to say?"  "Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me."  Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,  "The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.:15.570043129888862
From their infancy, they have been intended for each other.:22.261830653112785
It was the favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of her's.:22.47137640491166
While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family!:12.689240275551773
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?:28.886011390074245
To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh?:26.890382689169698
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy?:14.184135457419622
Have you not heard me say, that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"  "Yes, and I had heard it before.:16.629605512293566
But what is that to me?:61.47761077970429
If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh.:13.884159183775788
You both did as much as you could, in planning the marriage.:24.691771119325537
If Mr.:222.51346579813176
And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"  "Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.:9.388748407363146
Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.:13.991688963060819
You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him.:16.786569383937987
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us."  "These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth.:11.106328075784951
"But the wife of Mr.:35.1123121151251
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine."  "Obstinate, headstrong girl!:13.155345715144902
I am ashamed of you!:82.30202054792677
Is nothing due to me on that score?:36.756476365944536
"Let us sit down.:57.38254228274641
You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it.:9.889431195163668
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."  "_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on _me_."  "I will not be interrupted.:12.210341407979042
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other.:18.644761758371725
They are descended on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancient, though untitled families.:15.359878579906818
Their fortune on both sides is splendid.:18.20843330190618
They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?:13.229766217176186
The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune.:21.602940642580595
Is this to be endured!:101.04928173072679
If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere, in which you have been brought up."  "In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere.:11.855296878895585
He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal."  "True.:20.174300006811148
You _are_ a gentleman's daughter.:36.58428045468502
Who are your uncles and aunts?:18.763689816575315
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition."  "Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."  "Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"  Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a moment's deliberation,  "I am not."  Lady Catherine seemed pleased.:12.189781349814389
"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"  "I will make no promise of the kind."  "Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.:15.660049795497144
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman.:31.202082603169877
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede.:22.746732848610254
I shall not go away, till you have given me the assurance I require."  "And I certainly _never_ shall give it.:15.05494328035139
I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.:16.066525403406487
Your ladyship wants Mr.:46.12615896916446
Supposing him to be attached to me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?:15.304843839982897
Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged.:11.201832737811511
You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.:14.593204438601866
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine.:10.223288366646376
I have by no means done.:40.361911123477825
To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add.:18.006760111012035
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement.:19.240326710166247
I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.:17.578351646665684
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"  "You can _now_ have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered.:12.286883877623485
"You have insulted me, in every possible method.:33.93109207611067
I must beg to return to the house."  And she rose as she spoke.:27.615142466477263
Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back.:24.094375524598245
Her ladyship was highly incensed.:48.01428927382784
"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!:26.755621155254328
Unfeeling, selfish girl!:19.94512244807329
Do you not consider that a connection with you, must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"  "Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say.:15.027632401065162
You know my sentiments."  "You are then resolved to have him?"  "I have said no such thing.:17.54674886016509
I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."  "It is well.:13.704310094024272
You refuse, then, to oblige me.:42.003252412329196
You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.:15.759197389671462
No principle of either, would be violated by my marriage with Mr.:14.363498038627746
And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn."  "And this is your real opinion!:14.202606850188852
This is your final resolve!:35.71884673294286
Very well.:221.7142730926906
I shall now know how to act.:35.128234113286894
Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.:16.42101820712836
I came to try you.:67.36350612147372
I hoped to find you reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point."  In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,  "I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.:12.759172519555026
I send no compliments to your mother.:35.71819911876635
You deserve no such attention.:52.337614838141626
I am most seriously displeased."  Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.:10.726864682770842
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.:19.90345924595812
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.:15.15187104291151
and her calling here was prodigiously civil!:24.81054219563733
for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.:23.85132954526049
She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you.:15.881112613628908
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"  Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.:15.930700761881923
The discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.:10.533682771882965
Lady Catherine it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.:9.156405290596998
but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply the idea.:11.593848232181987
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.:12.069496446932117
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked forward to as possible, at some future time.:8.866240414258696
In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference.:13.657124259791843
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce.:13.84085900104149
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side.:11.299750397405626
With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.:9.938867209138367
In that case he would return no more.:27.805177424518053
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.:13.237036961164542
I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy.:19.24430623934331
If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all."         *       *       *       *       *  The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs.:10.372941251808914
Bennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.:14.644296302623507
The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.:20.51811452851827
"Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room."  She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held.:13.1890737129666
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.:15.993894225675689
She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.:29.254190506064987
He then said,  "I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly.:14.065204476973138
As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents.:20.86703354028511
I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony.:19.194513269409327
Let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest."  The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued,  "You look conscious.:12.01545902487959
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer.:10.03549268756707
This letter is from Mr.:40.69543439725388
Collins."  "From Mr.:63.99155863743406
and what can _he_ have to say?"  "Something very much to the purpose of course.:23.594400860321002
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases.:13.979147574870158
I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point.:14.697224920187265
What relates to yourself, is as follows.:32.75492385880946
Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another: of which we have been advertised by the same authority.:11.380514376118873
Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate, may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious personages in this land."  "Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?" "This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage.:9.574237401843831
Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of."  "Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?:11.948978937055694
But now it comes out."  "My motive for cautioning you, is as follows.:16.965276817020573
Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_ surprised you.:21.144534856780805
Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related?:11.29980990322878
Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life!:13.888850524748117
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.:14.433463886333024
"Are you not diverted?"  "Oh!:27.475401829417518
Pray read on."  "After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.:10.593225036435214
I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned." "Mr.:12.759093852069453
I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married.:9.984250650953665
It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it.:11.185267476227626
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing." "_That_ is his notion of christian forgiveness!:10.954942619914123
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch.:15.983378911881243
But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.:23.39678791376229
You are not going to be _Missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.:19.416030464062892
For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?"  "Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted.:12.953232365862005
But it is so strange!"  "Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing.:15.37632544551713
Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_ pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!:11.939613386938282
Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr.:19.974030565109818
Collins's correspondence for any consideration.:28.93188611930873
Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law.:9.891895983174074
And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report?:22.58445137008566
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.:17.49777035565379
Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr.:21.501306611082246
Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.:11.587605988154648
The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs.:31.967741723900552
Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out.:12.84265169142042
It was agreed to.:77.56117766084114
Bennet was not in the habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five set off together.:12.088219961573893
They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy, were to entertain each other.:26.570960311565564
Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.:11.072024567044396
They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone.:11.941323999225302
Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said,  "Mr.:16.41560411569762
Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's.:13.776708908499732
I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister.:14.195183468868551
Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it.:16.02921975562828
Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express."  "I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.:12.075854814798296
I did not think Mrs.:52.2645735903149
Gardiner was so little to be trusted."  "You must not blame my aunt.:24.27746006229453
Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars.:17.04763858286524
That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny.:15.831451529808255
But your _family_ owe me nothing.:22.3673946465843
Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought only of _you_."  Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.:18.05388260772705
The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.:13.071156067667152
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.:11.004230967908635
There was too much to be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects.:27.451311929507963
But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.:17.768643247081123
"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before.:17.48849785031851
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly."  Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_.:12.005518402152891
After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations."  "What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?:14.689140023951323
"The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility."  "I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.:12.107162261304696
The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.:17.87796800750747
Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner.' Those were your words.:8.551385889342303
You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."  "I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression.:11.294424347809349
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way."  "I can easily believe it.:15.828382502915638
You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did.:13.800152530322363
The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way, that would induce you to accept me."  "Oh!:14.535233723547409
do not repeat what I then said.:28.701123505111738
I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it."  Darcy mentioned his letter.:16.95416879207039
"I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary.:17.042987931325957
I hope you have destroyed the letter.:38.49851976996028
There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again.:14.179267272649184
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me."  "The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies."  "When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit."  "The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.:9.28574893587802
The adieu is charity itself.:38.928713336738895
But think no more of the letter.:56.3983345499681
The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten.:15.122744715006206
You must learn some of my philosophy.:44.276419405501834
But with _me_, it is not so.:36.19294041034307
Painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.:14.834162684009057
I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.:17.761287474632365
I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.:17.082238903079272
Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_) I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own.:8.182642898647476
Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth!:16.00021362433753
What do I not owe you!:21.898366560297244
You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.:13.896428332384087
By you, I was properly humbled.:46.83431660756206
I came to you without a doubt of my reception.:34.345591189681
You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."  "Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"  "Indeed I had.:13.301462861099228
What will you think of my vanity?:64.72759167583017
I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses."  "My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you.:12.61573433731674
I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.:14.331997258852116
How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"  "Hate you!:14.081685647380139
I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction."  "I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at Pemberley.:11.80503205451094
You blamed me for coming?"  "No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."  "Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.:11.644055608555666
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due."  "My object _then_," replied Darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to.:11.060063430193084
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you."  He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.:9.552208556837728
She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.:17.203116050774828
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.:14.152631295245206
"What could become of Mr.:35.12551543749119
Bingley and Jane!" was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs.:9.615471945425904
"I must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elizabeth.:19.78448767452011
"Not at all.:76.5190276071214
When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."  "That is to say, you had given your permission.:19.45971271848547
I guessed as much." And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case.:19.477497935589273
"On the evening before my going to London," said he "I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.:17.35043245939413
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs, absurd and impertinent.:15.196479851734347
His surprise was great.:73.54438780698919
He had never had the slightest suspicion.:39.96342481777119
I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."  Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.:12.530741055978186
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection."  "And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him."  "It did.:14.22098682038907
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.:30.404010254852604
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine, made every thing easy.:10.842348574338066
I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.:17.52480814536464
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.:14.915975467095995
He has heartily forgiven me now."  Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr.:13.949879139006073
Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself.:12.168929507577818
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it was rather too early to begin.:16.845335708886175
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house.:18.148535682519384
In the hall they parted.:61.63919837329586
"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and from all the others when they sat down to table.:13.820423913540298
She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge.:20.417036027036445
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.:16.060090685128564
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy, than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her.:10.553257515721146
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.:12.555396944751296
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.:15.187923615274933
"You are joking, Lizzy.:43.67276626995428
This cannot be!--engaged to Mr.:24.687128802114902
No, no, you shall not deceive me.:33.99001703988577
I know it to be impossible."  "This is a wretched beginning indeed!:21.971713109231914
Yet, indeed, I am in earnest.:32.32418410205304
He still loves me, and we are engaged."  Jane looked at her doubtingly.:19.741934540203406
"Oh, Lizzy!:87.57415868638928
it cannot be.:203.01273361271998
I know how much you dislike him."  "You know nothing of the matter.:23.63563951905981
_That_ is all to be forgot.:59.28797455596084
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.:24.28375625436643
But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.:19.002524370485638
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself."  Miss Bennet still looked all amazement.:15.232902434173031
Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth.:28.529341913838724
can it be really so!:34.883074300588994
Yet now I must believe you," cried Jane.:23.322105623340516
"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you certain?:17.676765920116935
forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?"  "There can be no doubt of that.:17.632867011570795
It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world.:20.033604551246466
But are you pleased, Jane?:60.88120201821475
Shall you like to have such a brother?"  "Very, very much.:29.925134863436455
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight.:12.679942453229932
But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.:35.17543547453483
And do you really love him quite well enough?:32.75129697198199
Oh, Lizzy!:102.38333719732798
do any thing rather than marry without affection.:22.526593197393886
You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I tell you all."  "What do you mean?"  "Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley.:15.955622312043227
I am afraid you will be angry."  "My dearest sister, now _be_ be serious.:15.343366980216135
Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay.:23.710512096636204
Will you tell me how long you have loved him?"  "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.:12.676054227811022
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley."  Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment.:8.693122936337653
When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish.:18.54318560074141
I always had a value for him.:40.180557314609885
Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me.:14.487500104612387
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton!:19.778273726948857
I owe all that I know of it, to another, not to you."  Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.:28.46880400208967
She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend.:13.950719988964313
All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.:29.30245781796396
*       *       *       *       *  "Good gracious!" cried Mrs.:7.897250636015459
Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley!:15.630087362968052
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here?:16.247916708916954
I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company.:14.1321634783047
What shall we do with him?:68.84801508888138
Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"  "I advise Mr.:12.50357352980642
Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs.:36.58166704025318
Bennet, "to walk to Oakham Mount this morning.:16.982727058874474
It is a nice long walk, and Mr.:22.658656108277917
Bingley; "but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty.:18.506473387555562
Wont it, Kitty?"  Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.:12.5088500188923
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented.:17.49915339551226
As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs.:19.12917607188255
But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then.:13.952101451982774
So, do not put yourself to inconvenience."  During their walk, it was resolved that Mr.:14.145134195048843
Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening.:21.487029302380336
She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.:11.27725305557239
But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr.:13.049271231571364
*       *       *       *       *  In the evening, soon after Mr.:12.265401743390397
Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr.:30.713695968870724
Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme.:16.973715311009826
She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr.:11.089390032410988
Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.:21.882589051967315
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he wants you in the library." She was gone directly.:15.207901285054117
"Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing?:22.43781764764448
Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man?:25.04915776159463
Have not you always hated him?"  How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate!:11.4074877015172
It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr.:13.58071705406238
"Or in other words, you are determined to have him.:27.29616795726769
He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.:13.57861501047951
But will they make you happy?"  "Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my indifference?"  "None at all.:12.749234366393361
We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him."  "I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him.:15.064253014746749
Indeed he has no improper pride.:34.12994638007742
He is perfectly amiable.:77.26660681581114
You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms."  "Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent.:12.622875774393854
He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask.:17.697339056570634
But let me advise you to think better of it.:26.582679998585515
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior.:11.254896242511517
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage.:13.451432170185518
My child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life.:12.537658002701814
Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.:10.135035570163915
"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to say.:16.456374616016564
If this be the case, he deserves you.:30.01801021438849
I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy."  To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr.:12.054576571896805
Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.:29.869790217550225
He heard her with astonishment.:72.32718825593281
And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission!:13.255477223524993
So much the better.:52.09993125864519
It will save me a world of trouble and economy.:15.160175256721997
Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way.:11.692620137773224
I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."  He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr.:11.808420264311911
Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."  Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure.:11.75590404175111
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication.:17.366614038864643
Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs.:17.012945896327626
Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable.:18.639174845900893
Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them.:13.117938373267362
She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.:12.947624489650375
"Good gracious!:116.17755495502847
Lord bless me!:46.40960429443977
dear me!:229.18425018480974
And is it really true?:75.42736432894762
my sweetest Lizzy!:120.35760818740967
how rich and how great you will be!:27.37589861037461
Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all.:22.63381287758985
I am so pleased--so happy.:22.381315477519827
Such a charming man!--so handsome!:21.396813075725326
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.:16.055711650957598
I hope he will overlook it.:35.92367228453339
A house in town!:144.7686029692843
Every thing that is charming!:58.422464830893304
Three daughters married!:89.45028305938102
Ten thousand a year!:34.720101947529635
Oh, Lord!:54.723035185371074
What will become of me.:50.57023751014268
I shall go distracted."  This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away.:10.962673710198917
But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.:27.07682344544727
"My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else!:18.283081648893212
Ten thousand a year, and very likely more!:19.627857004513768
'Tis as good as a Lord!:35.02558980750197
And a special licence.:67.03783747651157
You must and shall be married by a special licence.:25.51730632353308
Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow."  This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for.:15.497600598051696
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs.:18.66890082319831
Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.:12.343294625144809
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr.:15.205302307908076
Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.:18.689549179289337
"Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well as Jane's."     CHAPTER XVIII.:15.276475804380825
Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.:14.557168672377237
"How could you begin?" said she.:25.496007438980772
"I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?"  "I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation.:12.768865512895328
It is too long ago.:59.20947660588259
Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?"  "For the liveliness of your mind, I did."  "You may as well call it impertinence at once.:13.734752362650882
It was very little less.:60.35276996828204
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone.:13.520717616489234
I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike _them_.:31.663433075244267
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you.:10.091425930146219
There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.:15.321263033435129
To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love."  "Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was ill at Netherfield?"  "Dearest Jane!:11.860422774990262
who could have done less for her?:43.63994780787762
But make a virtue of it by all means.:29.877829992790524
My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last.:10.326190753064541
What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?:16.329717807083156
Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?"  "Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."  "But I was embarrassed."  "And so was I."  "You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."  "A man who had felt less, might."  "How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it!:13.160125527708068
I wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you!:15.942856148553435
My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.:14.100741834504493
_Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the subject?:10.696951737030783
The moral will be perfectly fair.:55.88371264241512
Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of removing all my doubts.:11.673614134143728
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.:11.860566738387243
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's.:24.178118179510317
My aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing."  "Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use.:15.094971846165901
But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for?:32.70000210069289
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?:19.482020583722374
or had you intended any more serious consequence?"  "My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me.:14.620205732349039
But it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly."  "And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.:15.14900085804968
Gardiner's long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:       "I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have      done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but      to say the truth, I was too cross to write.:11.485114759135573
You supposed more than      really existed.:42.047319706413305
You must write again very      soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.:16.82142691367148
I      thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes.:29.39193165679081
How could I      be so silly as to wish it!:28.35385495703139
Your idea of the ponies is delightful.:38.04959098880822
I am the happiest creature in      the world.:24.87024019664423
Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one      with such justice.:21.78848179344325
I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I      laugh.:22.454625287451407
Darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can      spare from me.:19.206900276129726
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.:26.59697174992259
Your's, &c."  Mr.:18.30944833568322
Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine, was in a different style; and still different from either, was what Mr.:16.716705520500675
Bennet sent to Mr.:53.40478297235693
Collins, in reply to his last.:49.193100505731486
"DEAR SIR,       "I must trouble you once more for congratulations.:19.089086385282297
Elizabeth will      soon be the wife of Mr.:24.341286187966134
Console Lady Catherine as well as      you can.:29.038325160880472
But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew.:29.893194850223413
He has      more to give.:88.39724662712086
"Your's sincerely, &c."  Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere.:14.548017024597312
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard.:18.834346695103182
Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.:12.712098626292287
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother's in sending it.:12.954234400691671
Before any answer could arrive from Mr.:15.147266177991094
Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge.:15.594599437687574
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident.:26.33154466110944
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over.:12.555754218543347
At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr.:14.060106991567453
Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband.:18.061346808505018
He bore it however with admirable calmness.:22.66224341442195
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St.:9.680856649401221
James's, with very decent composure.:19.84900432602413
If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.:11.705965926773692
Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs.:13.398149329766216
Philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.:11.767505350421839
Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant.:16.742233830510674
Elizabeth did all she could, to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.:11.699319156117914
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs.:19.416828528107338
Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.:21.93189989954437
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs.:13.759670859123803
Bingley and talked of Mrs.:44.96480932937378
Darcy may be guessed.:93.59213322846273
He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.:22.5415471023697
So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.:10.929416937987757
The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.:12.51867514220761
Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters.:16.297951145358596
In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great.:18.200345850879774
She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid.:11.036411549674852
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs.:13.626589059086958
Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.:15.641411579918588
Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone.:17.90840105413185
Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.:11.001177625211627
As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters.:16.20521803332631
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune.:9.51001176138478
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.:17.35549835535317
If you love Mr.:51.90008595559359
It is a great comfort to have you      so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will      think of us.:20.160259759409296
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very      much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live      upon without some help.:10.509115225484013
Any place would do, of about three or four      hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr.:15.713455364641197
Darcy about it,      if you had rather not.:45.54166950189183
"Yours, &c."  As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.:12.995741709708959
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance towards discharging their bills.:8.739174078120797
Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme.:15.84546618510931
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.:12.095073631911157
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.:11.781650736093615
Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.:14.599125104214998
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.:10.946716347373545
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.:7.976623163071104
Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.:19.281905992658015
They were able to love each other, even as well as they intended.:22.10094059322757
He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry.:10.953665441894001
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way.:18.749578208128884
By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.:11.79855382794751
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end.:11.348704134263148
But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.:11.453711177372073
With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.:27.12186819291916
Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.:13.006599303362224
