" you must decide for yourself ," said elizabeth , " and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , i advise you by all means to refuse him ." " how can you talk so ?"-- said jane faintly smiling ,--" you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , i could not hesitate ." " i did not think you would ;-- and that being the case , i cannot consider your situation with much compassion ." " but if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . : 320.2308898045564
gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from mr . : 172.99934276714427
i rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal . : 279.4942434576123
howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs . : 450.20173985162404
never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self - consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings . : 453.93254382903893
bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if i recollect right , he went but the day before . : 360.8603396728388
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again . : 382.7934278579794
bingley and netherfield . : 221.66144534767315
he seldom appeared really animated . : 5584.646564672535
gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr . : 222.11989770414422
her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness . : 478.626225251335
it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of _some_ , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible ." " are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ?" " both ," replied elizabeth archly ; " for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds .-- we are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb ." " this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure ," said he . : 346.59293010068836
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable . : 310.50587878808483
collins moreover adds ," " i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia ' s sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known . : 685.6947137093123
" about a month ago i received this letter , and about a fortnight ago i answered it , for i thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention . : 964.9620165015673
jenkinson ' s room . : 149.3663792702058
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying -- and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as i certainly did ." the idea of mr . : 127.44505554525013
bennet , for many years after lydia ' s birth , had been certain that he would . : 189.8105431881017
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs . : 3444.369680828604
for , though your accusations were ill - founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof . : 1212.3486662131402
" i wonder ," said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is likely to be in this country much longer ." " i do not at all know ; but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield . : 125.05623317189762
i want to talk very seriously . : 682.3338926484004
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages . : 6305.698823303966
miss bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , " pray , miss eliza , are not the ---- shire militia removed from meryton ? : 134.1090446662991
jones ' s being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians . : 654.2002511091165
darcy was condemned as the worst of men . : 349.1953678917803
but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ?" elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning . : 194.7472580253716
when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ?" " these are home questions -- and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature . : 752.0224927358634
one morning , about a week after bingley ' s engagement with jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining - room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn . : 143.27546486899854
bingley ?" " not at all ." " he is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man . : 142.43788608098419
my sole dependence was on you ; and i am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . : 109.08504299948693
you are not going to be _missish_ , i hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report . : 260.83688327297466
very well . : 59.780450205316825
she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcy ' s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another . : 365.55328797429706
elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight . : 726.5669191605853
i should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire ." " oh ! : 46.68729599654425
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees . : 339.90040405822333
the pause was to elizabeth ' s feelings dreadful . : 262.4946374323142
darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only ." " i have not a doubt of mr . : 132.0209347480157
but there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good - natured wishes for her well - doing , which had proceeded before , from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain . : 394.42997398663283
but i knew not -- i was afraid of doing too much . : 153.9077787196645
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane . : 77.62432513823147
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure . : 168.81943982158805
collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her ' s , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary . : 307.6994136333381
" if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapside ," cried bingley , " it would not make them one jot less agreeable ." " but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world ," replied darcy . : 317.4065281961174
who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival !" " i am the less surprised at what has happened ," replied sir william , " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire . : 590.0568571869758
the gentlemen did approach ; and when mr . : 354.6940534196924
hurst and mr . : 41.16778943649152
charlotte the wife of mr . : 90.642493605052
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long ." " upon my word , sir ," cried elizabeth , " your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration . : 384.88001345263314
she could think only of her letter . : 65.2611194916272
" oh , lizzy ! : 47.131042030509654
their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up , though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham ' s extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them . : 933.3952829681893
she will make him a very proper wife ." mr . : 137.35100788220493
gardiner could do . : 79.49875501982791
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance . : 366.75154428207236
lizzy , why am i thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ! : 862.3540954178482
bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast - room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection . : 481.4314952474157
he cannot know what mr . : 53.72465826587166
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other . : 584.9789971083821
adieu to disappointment and spleen . : 1919.4833623436623
it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again ! : 191.13263768851223
i enquired after their brother , of course . : 107.45371627598276
they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family . : 289.9470255294908
i shall now know how to act . : 435.3191403947273
when jane and elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of mr . : 155.11355154290493
she related the subject of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain . : 194.2590830113503
he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room . : 102.51812440000022
darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her . : 59.72903869004064
i grieve to find , however , that colonel f . : 166.98252098663713
day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed mrs . : 561.2505244101221
kitty was the only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy . : 555.1851033800805
elizabeth ' s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr . : 202.72938932876104
it adds even another motive . : 2318.1442913217084
darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner .-- you cannot refuse to dance , i am sure , when so much beauty is before you ." and taking her hand , he would have given it to mr . : 192.45351033393825
but elizabeth was not formed for ill - humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice . : 289.0983835942967
_that_ is all to be forgot . : 274.59523838105696
these two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a sallad and cucumber . : 1088.490893048406
i hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it i will carry my point ." in this manner lady catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , " i take no leave of you , miss bennet . : 210.59755724935954
it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy . : 73.11585168894565
bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane . : 795.7145341156873
wickham had received his commission before he left london , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight . : 68.7143538807428
i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do ." mr . : 433.2302033496015
collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn . : 1607.1870215458055
she looked at jane , to see how she bore it ; but jane was very composedly talking to bingley . : 90.41507891205029
collins arrived on tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have prompted . : 476.65875002611034
he did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . : 153.27970262344357
her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious . : 203.8461839048184
i cannot find out that i hate her at all , or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl . : 72.63289549266591
and now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , _make_ them marry . : 199.5240347906894
till i can forget his father , i can never defy or expose _him_ ." elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them . : 555.7954053194155
the church _ought_ to have been my profession -- i was brought up for the church , and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now ." " indeed !" " yes -- the late mr . : 142.34450731698252
in the absence of jane , he always attached himself to elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when bingley was gone , jane constantly sought the same means of relief . : 162.67111653899377
you deserve no such attention . : 385.59310853615114
the rector of a parish has much to do .-- in the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron . : 427.95114165232604
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement . : 179.0241934990923
charlotte is an excellent manager , i dare say . : 227.73460230805972
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense . : 399.02059603377694
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur . : 362.9274836822502
" i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself -- for i am fond of superior society ; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas ." he paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her , " my dear miss eliza , why are not you dancing ?-- mr . : 262.9802071342764
" oh ! : 50.71763528563534
bennet give up the point . : 164.8342165061394
it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried . : 267.2902900731403
i cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family ." and with a bow to mr . : 347.8273804119851
" i found ," said he , " as the time drew near , that i had better not meet mr . : 47.921093493304674
i have no such injuries to resent . : 1000.8372028526703
chapter xi . : 1899.4209835760337
having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report . : 491.24108119383345
gardiner , wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers . : 884.6552401906948
you mentioned _two_ instances . : 4394.530463852147
darcy ' s regard ." " mr . : 26.824620183864262
you may depend upon my seeking no further ." " oh ! : 172.9767625881467
but really , and upon my honour , i will try to do what i think to be wisest ; and now , i hope you are satisfied ." her aunt assured her that she was ; and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented . : 204.8311866156251
bingley ," said her husband ; " it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life ." this roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once . : 145.70149247106642
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect . : 336.0629214414647
of mr . : 51.27894352846318
it is very hard to think that she might have been mr . : 30.966474962540286
darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london ! : 345.3028661382367
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one ." " i cannot pretend to be sorry ," said wickham , after a short interruption , " that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with _him_ i believe it does not often happen . : 148.92892387296789
with the mention of derbyshire , there were many ideas connected . : 198.13040023874893
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable . : 909.1040719455817

elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs . : 248.9127187263507
she was teazed by mr . : 273.733386661334
elizabeth was surprised , however , that wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes . : 158.02107995495678
" you are too hasty , sir ," she cried . : 93.39021531376042
darcy ' s indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too _little_ , she might have fancied too _much_ . : 259.42706293395685
she was wild to be at home -- to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia , her uncle ' s interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe . : 383.50291302246376
there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister ' s frailty would have mortified her so much . : 240.14013151762268
darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued . : 938.0367150422343
but , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art ." " undoubtedly ," replied darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation . : 1428.206570276233
her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank . : 441.58126951987543
after playing some italian songs , miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air ; and soon afterwards mr . : 1827.9557342047042
i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to any one less worthy ." to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what mr . : 397.5946119931904
miss darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful . : 359.13632519227815
his belief of her sister ' s insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice . : 206.6110698661686
i do not know who is good enough for him ." mr . : 47.15677284896129
darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to mrs . : 91.97141009114128
she had always felt that charlotte ' s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage . : 352.5570456809545
philips ' s vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though mrs . : 385.89623966344476
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought . : 336.70132693503234
i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly . : 330.34122429841636
heaven forbid ! : 1899.4209835760337
collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half - whisper to lady lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man . : 185.0620980773343
" and of this place ," thought she , " i might have been mistress ! : 109.98185350646584
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and mrs . : 162.2812632086502
you have employed your time much better . : 541.42591315267
as soon as they entered the copse , lady catherine began in the following manner :-- " you can be at no loss , miss bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither . : 159.54917808051445
but here he was set right by mrs . : 862.8605568392184
collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him . : 213.9241681330286
bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it . : 191.0038053267548
his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure . : 443.1295342185132
my uncle !" cried jane , " what do you mean , sir ?" " i mean , that no man in his senses , would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a - year during my life , and fifty after i am gone ." " that is very true ," said elizabeth ; " though it had not occurred to me before . : 137.68641344487165
darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house . : 302.4957259760766
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance . : 93.20427677166693
every body said how well she looked ; and mr . : 334.57200577438135
i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish ." " my dear mr . : 381.9747159099176
you must not suspect me . : 266.5207622184952
and so , i suppose , they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead . : 78.36718454135628
bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight ." " but my father cannot .-- he wrote last week to hurry my return ." " oh ! : 612.9411432143494
your idea of the ponies is delightful . : 407.23000686365765
they must be a great loss to _your_ family ." in darcy ' s presence she dared not mention wickham ' s name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ' s distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill - natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone . : 523.1442077291127
his revenge would have been complete indeed . : 686.2055718429253
" if i had been able ," said she , " to carry my point of going to brighton , with all my family , _this_ would not have happened ; but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her . : 104.94515853899094
they stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance . : 242.4108096694424
allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear miss eliza , ( glancing at her sister and bingley ,) shall take place . : 180.4470943973707
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .-- elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane ' s being in the fairest way for happiness . : 373.44436310242116
i pity , though i cannot help blaming her . : 293.69402353695847
darcy danced only once with mrs . : 162.0422487861941
but when she read , and re - read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham ' s resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate . : 686.5368266923517
darcy than he has received ; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister ' s , mr . : 77.72668714909696

conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none . : 310.40043452238666
" don ' t keep coughing so , kitty , for heaven ' s sake ! : 216.1186149178731
society has claims on us all ; and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body ." elizabeth ' s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr . : 348.02572595857976
collins ," said she , " speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , i suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman ." " i believe her to be both in a great degree ," replied wickham ; " i have not seen her for many years , but i very well remember that i never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent . : 200.86147785790314
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture . : 1467.5030372706506
at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance . : 486.24369065276863
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other . : 498.3305020035047
collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings . : 907.9355239278391

may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ?" " they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible ." mr . : 650.7155375125164
have you heard from my uncle ?" " yes , i have had a letter from him by express ." " well , and what news does it bring ? : 81.0591953445558
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from mrs . : 265.8708788123322
bennet , delighted to speak to a lady catherine . : 122.08485438862168
elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him . : 124.75771595362727
" to jane herself ," she exclaimed , " there could be no possibility of objection . : 367.09370259967545
but if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself ." " no , that i am sure i shall not ; and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical . : 108.86452081865764
" i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man ' s intimates in the regiment , whether wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself . : 164.78150656413013
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it . : 838.248677681591
at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving mr . : 139.74488068200804

" he could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? : 146.50900007182327
gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else . : 320.2925449430711
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications ." " indeed , mr . : 110.36267255969031

but , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if i still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . : 472.65926041750777
jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs . : 503.4473465189773
such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret . : 767.5806319198036
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion ' s justifying her coming so far alone . : 500.9871237468569
but not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company . : 456.45525396556286
how can mr . : 167.44582710760906
her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted . : 298.7934348472435
i have met with two instances lately ; one i will not mention ; the other is charlotte ' s marriage . : 326.96327100680344
i was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . : 1599.1270040835614
when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham ' s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful . : 721.1314205122907
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct . : 590.0061739870407
a flirt too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . : 1350.6638710485054

the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained . : 1096.2788582151566

both sisters were uncomfortable enough . : 107.65029496965924
gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on . : 308.36456098566646
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity . : 480.4536902016952
in short , i will do my best ." " perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often . : 167.9424268893669
is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ?-- a glass of wine ;-- shall i get you one ?-- you are very ill ." " no , i thank you ;" she replied , endeavouring to recover herself . : 657.0517292020943
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs . : 2451.6161896172803
collins was wishing to marry you . : 390.0781811809074
she wrote even to jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard . : 232.8652577968161
bennet ' s eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , " well , jane , who is it from ? : 132.52312396623924
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did i receive in the mean time . : 711.8323781040165
you know my sentiments ." " you are then resolved to have him ?" " i have said no such thing . : 129.63438904569975
but , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother ' s . : 135.52210588117762
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter ' s lips instead of your own . : 1123.153306744541
no , kitty , i have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it . : 121.90378955526104
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it . : 153.85877568656124
she was overpowered by shame and vexation . : 88.14250776866666
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . : 2330.789209313871
his countenance rather gained in austerity ; and he scarcely opened his lips . : 1469.573638911314
bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home . : 442.33542499928694
darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections . : 1550.3780016797814
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door . : 582.5377458323215
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman . : 369.8954854067165
a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other , and out of their _three_ months ' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_ . : 694.1804555831291
the marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants . : 457.44555777592416
she was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence ; mr . : 649.2269376347655
bennet exceedingly . : 385.6294120633789
is not he a charming man ? : 206.12651091803565
darcy , for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved ." " certainly . : 1870.1417015123181
it was a fortnight since mrs . : 233.43327989467798
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort , much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements . : 5092.3909029724155
and mrs . : 61.71364641750763
gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to london , at the same time that mr . : 61.89829694262863
elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known sir william ' s too long . : 159.57076248684604
but above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked . : 659.2584432625524
a younger son , you know , must be inured to self - denial and dependence ." " in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either . : 115.63362560715004
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton . : 412.3764228578293
but it was her business to be satisfied -- and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again . : 337.23368415862603
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter . : 121.65359522547618
she was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so . : 168.30071483871185
darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ' s active superintendance , and when immediately before my father ' s death , mr . : 232.94837532940045
only let me assure you , my dear miss elizabeth , that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . : 275.4860854655467
gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive . : 354.98599580878647
collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh . : 724.6058032186241
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn ; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up . : 572.5975561414269
he spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided . : 308.1043499539131
maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire . : 792.0047008614001
darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .-- mr . : 498.5659210831454
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of mr . : 534.0310700423785
he was received by mrs . : 107.37281374705013
gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces . : 442.92559587098094

" but depend upon it , mr . : 40.4280201114331
" my dear , dear lydia !" she cried : " this is delightful indeed !-- she will be married !-- i shall see her again !-- she will be married at sixteen !-- my good , kind brother !-- i knew how it would be -- i knew he would manage every thing . : 205.13911673412613
anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing - room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil . : 376.0988001772605
" yet it is hard ," she sometimes thought , " that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation ! : 777.5933888346873
but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited . : 807.7540261172838
nothing could be more delightful ! : 420.9666039345192
must it be so ?" " oh , lord ! : 47.06779822061871

the park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground . : 241.3656617303616
and , my dear jane , i never saw you look in greater beauty . : 89.08182447051915
darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth ' s person , behaviour , and dress . : 259.6852695107035
elizabeth silently attended her . : 317.35951596842494

mary ' s powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected .-- elizabeth was in agonies . : 537.1724758481114
with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning . : 957.1331258830819

when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to mrs . : 150.1551196111707
as she went up stairs to get ready , mrs . : 106.8224944706005

" i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself . : 222.86329295196
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home . : 355.564769010637
bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield . : 295.5392401938276

philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards . : 809.6053964684716
but why mr . : 300.2629990691033
the hall , the dining - room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs . : 298.7899370101769
elizabeth ' s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view . : 607.6806941675596
to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit <URL> while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements , we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate . : 3321.866727747002
but , however , that shan ' t prevent my asking him to dine here , i am determined . : 87.26320115493824
let me never see either one or the other again !" yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re - kindled the admiration of her former lover . : 831.772767488363
" and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ?" " i hope not ." " it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first ." " may i ask to what these questions tend ?" " merely to the illustration of _your_ character ," said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity . : 658.2017053593892
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference ; her ' s lasted a little longer ; and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her . : 385.42465232803363
elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it . : 566.0366933804859
" my dear lizzy , where can you have been walking to ?" was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table . : 54.70213704447245
darcy , she could not but allow that mr . : 42.48271682887721
on the very day of my coming home from longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . : 132.99329740936685
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , " in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned . : 441.27399925115594
it was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , " say nothing of that . : 132.5274497237429
i dare say the lace upon mrs . : 349.6196284109486
" i hope ," added mrs . : 107.91828554861962
" but it is fortunate ," thought she , " that i have something to wish for . : 55.0260149943091
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling ." " to be sure , lizzy ," said her aunt , " he is not so handsome as wickham ; or rather he has not wickham ' s countenance , for his features are perfectly good . : 115.3991720255399
that he should have been in love with her for so many months ! : 57.81377501441404
two obstacles of the five being thus removed , mrs . : 880.8945894192285
i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her . : 1178.895367013651
if you received the work electronically , the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund . : 225.62195291526135
elizabeth felt jane ' s pleasure . : 146.59800415705166
every girl in , or near meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites ." * * * * * it may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey . : 535.2680453490221
in a short time , i shall have a daughter married . : 45.923379069250835
collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth -- and it was soon done -- done while mrs . : 440.57982499675677
but however he did not . : 229.92526468921594
but her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton , these visitors came . : 403.14466463631754
gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends . : 159.78730218252542
thoughtless , thoughtless lydia !" cried elizabeth when she had finished it . : 229.4811642136841
i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them ." " i am not now to learn ," replied mr . : 76.85001279770901
bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy . : 163.73112292733805
" how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter !" he made no answer . : 402.23003306228435
darcy appeared . : 184.5595338994569
but of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house . : 625.232216071983
bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him . : 375.4493155438448
if his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , _he_ was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer . : 233.1768175220776
" he has made me so happy ," said she , one evening , " by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! : 111.3731799788314
you take delight in vexing me . : 924.0170378142817
bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr . : 583.9413827984783
jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed . : 980.2068386205447
elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother ' s thoughts , now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _her_ coming away . : 240.20892334012345
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom . : 253.8795779301718
mamma would like to go too of all things ! : 641.2928584103757
he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it . : 105.08105757583574
is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? : 551.061038177686
other schemes too came into her head . : 588.1834096810976
london : printed for t . : 5584.646564672535
lady catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to darcy , " miss bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a london master . : 186.90479699915352
" we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us ," said mrs . : 527.8103150165023
but against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered . : 332.730620166806
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance . : 1613.4472311780041
easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at rosings , which in so small a circle must be important . : 366.779022861803
as soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ; and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of kitty ' s and lydia ' s purchases , were seated in it . : 481.0526797243589
he walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! : 260.3189644084254
he smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things . : 356.39198324719774
yours ever , " caroline bingley ." " with the officers !" cried lydia . : 168.49024247938223
how are you all ?" " my mother is tolerably well , i trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . : 407.6146957699815
" what can be the meaning of this !" said charlotte , as soon as he was gone . : 41.58111557675275
collins knew not what to make of him . : 73.03541854560395
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents .-- your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry mr . : 132.72928536005944
i am sorry to pain you -- but so it was . : 131.97075813127384
" my dear friend , " if you are not so compassionate as to dine to - day with louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day ' s tte -  - tte between two women can never end without a quarrel . : 248.62215751504235
i do not trust my own partiality . : 283.1776530360171
chapter xii . : 1899.4209835760337
no one but mrs . : 57.11046997823535
darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred . : 1139.8823992198447
well , he is a very undeserving young man -- and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . : 111.59615651144766
bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended mr . : 1034.2180574567656
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen ." " i should take him , even on _my_ slight acquaintance , to be an ill - tempered man ." wickham only shook his head . : 356.00420184455913
his anxiety for jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others . : 468.00790568165064
darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do ." " and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason . : 256.1279813808382
but still he would be her husband .-- without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well - educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want . : 1230.2368807894766
let us flatter ourselves that _i_ may be the survivor ." this was not very consoling to mrs . : 273.1299961260113
jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved . : 411.583096430747
bennet and her daughters then departed , and elizabeth returned instantly to jane , leaving her own and her relations ' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr . : 199.97435968350592
but that gentleman ," looking at darcy , " seemed to think the country was nothing at all ." " indeed , mama , you are mistaken ," said elizabeth , blushing for her mother . : 109.26080659052866
i now give it to _you_ , if you are resolved on having him . : 277.0121044442691
darcy ! : 820.9750967766473
bennet had no more to say ; and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken . : 454.76352482994895
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement , the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law . : 954.7790123967102
" as soon as ever mr . : 30.175712423790543
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour . : 262.6271454338593
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame . : 673.2690514640024
the first part of mrs . : 96.7090515277108
wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither lydia nor mr . : 191.60153195357714
but , alas ! : 46.923735699565555
hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend mr . : 235.92283980194435
indeed , eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them ." the wedding took place ; the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual . : 223.6682459615975
but , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her ." " no ," said colonel fitzwilliam , " that is an advantage which he must divide with me . : 187.61149169922868
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine . : 374.0139767956359
reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father ' s life time . : 208.87098629389592
" i know not , miss elizabeth ," said he , " whether mrs . : 67.9270826364666
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy . : 1562.726938590068
many small donations ($ <NUM> to $ <NUM> , <NUM> ) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs . : 5763.568443823986
a low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing . : 369.92429628407666
by mrs . : 67.0401654340912
the colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken . : 631.0446107133076
the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon . : 718.0069535026586
their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection . : 558.2275879921968
wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited . : 706.7738220250808
since the ---- shire were first quartered in meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head . : 158.23739277294237
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal . : 481.3896772269484
for your sake ," turning to charlotte , " i am glad of it ; but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line .-- it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh ' s family .-- do you play and sing , miss bennet ?" " a little ." " oh ! : 163.1671195367599
" well , well ," said he , " do not make yourself unhappy . : 39.074826280889994
and i think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece ' s . : 379.16667420293896
to the little town of lambton , the scene of mrs . : 387.6678570158453
bennet , " and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy . : 915.1661729668007
i wish i could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well - informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly . : 247.53459598696054
darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ?-- poor eliza !-- to be only just _tolerable_ ." " i beg you would not put it into lizzy ' s head to be vexed by his ill - treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . : 322.79770615869865
we must not all expect jane ' s good fortune ." " true ," said mr . : 63.58739613758594
bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger miss lucases ; and lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person ' s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her . : 313.35668483496863
he has more to give . : 229.2290726268817
i do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain . : 221.50473853012392
bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast . : 393.8293633748589
there is not a bit of fish to be got to - day . : 230.392466525287
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine , frankly and openly ." elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " yes , you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_ . : 451.36565852613717
and so would anne , if her health had allowed her to apply . : 804.0138439896555
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters ." " my mother would have had no objection , but my father hates london ." " has your governess left you ?" " we never had any governess ." " no governess ! : 479.02208087333776
he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others . : 124.87212553985506
collins by jane ' s introduction of him . : 267.1640426113865
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship ' s entrance , though no request of introduction had been made . : 175.40361361984225
" i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ?" said he , as he joined her . : 160.37839094037335
could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to colonel forster ? : 333.25348489516745
as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females ." " i do assure you , sir , that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man . : 497.08098237059227
it was at sir william lucas ' s , where a large party were assembled . : 64.87457989863655
elizabeth was delighted . : 542.8470419243625
and with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ' s concern -- and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn ." " and this is your real opinion ! : 210.93834838192524
" i do not know when i have been more shocked ," said she . : 54.12194633213622
bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed their all walking out . : 357.3939579686819
i shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer . : 844.1394745318421
collins ' s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened ; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest . : 361.3372058549113
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce . : 213.50676984479338
that had his actions been what wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as mr . : 446.218230687871
she is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and i have no opinion of her ." " no more have i ," said mr . : 112.82883356128124
gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green , something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w . : 230.95592477582628
bennet .-- they had several children . : 1390.6723783936143
bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time . : 135.68766035217212
at present i will say nothing about it ." " you are quite right . : 47.461864067272295
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect . : 552.8303776678615
" the first wish of my heart ," said she to herself , " is never more to be in company with either of them . : 92.76209843722332
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . : 194.42120002435288
bingley is coming down , sister ," ( for mrs . : 359.80954155107287
and so , darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ' s debts , and got him his commission ! : 565.1205684834142
" indeed i have , sir ," was her answer . : 169.095252109233
the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune . : 493.62053735453867
his family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion . : 562.8758860585118
pray read on ." " after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match . : 417.831625314579
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ; she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty . : 238.74590083904116
she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses . : 355.0158828725957
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity . : 694.3245481409302
among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous . : 415.21100664425757
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts ? : 1075.0154334207616
she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater -- what shall i call it ? : 330.2609571938418
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking . : 141.38103708999603
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . : 174.9582403040006
well , i was so frightened i did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day . : 134.9700343063226
bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth , " i am glad you are come back , lizzy ." their party in the dining - room was large , for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news : and various were the subjects which occupied them ; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; mrs . : 365.2412403923277
collins has made you an offer of marriage . : 22.890776191498208
when mr . : 50.77747572834998
every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight . : 355.38592391750274
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters , elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day . : 111.0464071766772
all was joy and kindness . : 440.1977928458431
widely different was the effect of a second perusal .-- how could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ?-- he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister ' s attachment ;-- and she could not help remembering what charlotte ' s opinion had always been .-- neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane .-- she felt that jane ' s feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility . : 264.2887121335141
" it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane ," said she . : 82.14418595610239
he now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself , as well as of mr . : 469.72324579296424
" you cannot be more than twenty , i am sure ,-- therefore you need not conceal your age ." " i am not one and twenty ." when the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed . : 140.74504319887956
darcy about it , if you had rather not . : 129.69432888177838
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above - mentioned ; and while mr . : 1234.9544116428851
" believe me , my dear miss elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections . : 441.67420707634227
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if i was her , i would not have put up with it . : 223.06307368313026
i was never more annoyed ! : 364.34655820538165
not like the wild young men now - a - days , who think of nothing but themselves . : 658.3316414526038
but perhaps ," added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . : 689.1927747618745
i wish i could see her . : 51.592075276513036
she talked to elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns . : 512.4792525866437
" but what is to be done about pemberley ?" cried mrs . : 122.22970142031112
hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when mr . : 460.61885477972396
bennet , was not so well pleased with it . : 74.01958249682902
but make a virtue of it by all means . : 617.077230008511
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet , with a polite congratulation ; mr . : 198.0080598358293
upon the whole , i am much pleased with him ." as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr . : 131.38770399025177
it was the favourite wish of _his_ mother , as well as of her ' s . : 203.00426427886595
darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise . : 227.07036394401902
if she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough . : 299.97856181634205
yes , yes . : 45.66341008082832
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . : 251.6365855579335

it has been most unconsciously done , however , and i hope will be of short duration . : 290.911052092321
" i am sure ," she added , " if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper i ever met with . : 112.52791622608189

the suspicions which had just arisen of mr . : 307.57999045440454
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it . : 528.0399937212948

but the gloom of lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from mrs . : 370.51272663818094
and she was only sixteen last june . : 996.8006180207315

but enough of this . : 266.1696094487402
collins ' s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete . : 260.84176172962975
it was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of miss bennet ' s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever . : 192.7502384958416
all this was acknowledged to mrs . : 78.58297307498378

when coffee was over , colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument . : 209.42786804875217
in this danger kitty is also comprehended . : 1798.461975609737
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected . : 219.68124214733055
miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her ." elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them . : 308.3532516535828
hurst and miss bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in london . : 75.50992529347582

and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report ? : 495.70675763598433
he had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein . : 211.71514423365016
mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs . : 241.1221935041752
but lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . : 284.2094871460922
you are safe from me ." " there is , i believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome ." " and _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body ." " and yours ," he replied with a smile , " is wilfully to misunderstand them ." " do let us have a little music ,"-- cried miss bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share .--" louisa , you will not mind my waking mr . : 510.13994734562436
at first there seemed danger of lydia ' s engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in particular . : 409.5408913100532
" this was a lucky idea of mine , indeed !" said mrs . : 125.25545031636307

she accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn , had by some accident been lost . : 259.6953415150501
not lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , mr . : 161.83599888970232
but my dearest love , tell me what dish mr . : 357.96598987164737
bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood ." " it is more than i engage for , i assure you ." " but consider your daughters . : 125.66384477345063
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " how long did you say that he was at rosings ?" " nearly three weeks ." " and you saw him frequently ?" " yes , almost every day ." " his manners are very different from his cousin ' s ." " yes , very different . : 74.62415788918055
gardiner . : 820.9750967766473
what is the matter ?" cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , " i will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after mr . : 252.9386335011344

wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on george wickham , who was his god - son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . : 225.19393579205055
the house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and lady catherine ' s behaviour was most friendly and obliging . : 159.15818146699502

the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of lady catherine ' s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough . : 247.11006723388348
bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure . : 164.54127682589714

it is every way horrible !" darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence . : 1282.576757045273
collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , " my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom -- provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained . : 444.40033438094474

darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_ , in spite of all miss bingley ' s witticisms on _fine eyes_ . : 130.73748657397493
bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ; but lady catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ; and then rising up , said to elizabeth , " miss bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn . : 373.8071212005601

but i think mr . : 125.74834690331939
to mr . : 60.05210520924374
he will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before ." elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing . : 154.00764014100093
but really , ma ' am , i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early .-- the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first . : 276.17077161445576
if i may so express it , he has a _right_ to be proud ." " that is very true ," replied elizabeth , " and i could easily forgive _his_ pride , if he had not mortified _mine_ ." " pride ," observed mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , " is a very common failing i believe . : 311.93126517112887
but it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly ." " and if i had not a letter to write myself , i might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . : 99.4916731920844
these parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not . : 890.940791453352
darcy , after enquiring of her how mr . : 250.72281696306263
the officer was the very mr . : 693.9024123928518
bennet , alarmed . : 661.369848311863
she talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr . : 87.0064145809461
but i ought to beg his pardon , for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant . : 144.14391780242659
he had to be sure done much . : 266.4719050977661
i am going to - morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him . : 590.9678678614997
consider mr . : 207.23326831110356
i quite detest the man ." chapter iv . : 421.4260594959321
i speak nothing but the truth . : 219.758322234234
you are to understand , miss bennet , that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will i be dissuaded from it . : 491.2949640128052
mary ," said she , " i wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! : 49.39501622649767
they had long wished to see him . : 109.02960294234789
wickham . : 114.16006977645726
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , " i did not know before that you ever walked this way ." " i have been making the tour of the park ," he replied , " as i generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage . : 238.76843832277703
" it certainly is a most iniquitous affair ," said mr . : 165.1743179380703
his understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and _that_ , if he marry _prudently_ , his wife may teach him . : 708.3987062100402
collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .-- i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . : 312.7623817519611
she would be in nobody ' s way , you know , in that part of the house ." mr . : 74.01292786482634
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which i do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister ' s being in town . : 155.60281385189214
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly .-- lady catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly - marked features , which might once have been handsome . : 360.35211853154755
he enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good - humoured ease that he had ever done . : 328.00946000197416
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ' s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr . : 165.98605120222743
" you used us abominably ill ," answered mrs . : 1039.1328003282142
darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light . : 283.3429194900328
iii . : 42.80038182497235
" yet why did he come ?" she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak . : 151.19625035015886
darcy is not to be laughed at !" cried elizabeth . : 140.24181462640874
i am most seriously displeased ." elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself . : 225.11115194906114
there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire ." " with all my heart ; i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it ." " i am talking of possibilities , charles ." " upon my word , caroline , i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation ." elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card - table , and stationed herself between mr . : 446.41582851055887
bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when mr . : 206.08682974881427
but the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me ." " this is quite shocking !-- he deserves to be publicly disgraced ." " some time or other he _will_ be -- but it shall not be by _me_ . : 214.8505006537914
find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to hunsford , and i will visit her .' allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . : 148.73669560573836
in town i believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation . : 833.1515982856846
i am not romantic you know . : 241.58321230862782
bingley ' s will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him ." jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern . : 298.5942942690061
wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball . : 157.58665843221198
lady catherine , sir william , and mr . : 26.074670567182636
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence , strict liability , breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph <NUM> . f . <NUM> . : 1849.561522449464
they were to be off as soon as possible . : 37.15389015865513
bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at netherfield . : 628.5489329586932
he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with lydia , to send any message to her . : 182.67238823735914
the sight of miss lucas was odious to her . : 269.52358000976767
the compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt . : 152.55441501510063
he is so excessively handsome ! : 307.2998696085432
she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour . : 107.55055034993293
affectation of candour is common enough ;-- one meets it every where . : 4545.031061964385
the room in which the ladies sat was backwards . : 892.8915696982338
darcy chose to doubt it -- or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing . : 1187.7072955680223
he had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it . : 154.1925188800258
you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe ; and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite . : 760.3299446227285
gregory b . : 229.33927885030084
" it was the prospect of constant society , and good society ," he added , " which was my chief inducement to enter the ---- shire . : 232.2494221725358
collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter . : 302.9954831853089
he had rather hoped that all his wife ' s views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear . : 152.70186279994056
not one party , or scheme , or any thing . : 176.42649166086053
how wonderfully these sort of things occur ! : 1295.0205712469804
if you do not charge anything for copies of this ebook , complying with the rules is very easy . : 243.17412951352787
" not at all ," was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it ." miss bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing mr . : 139.50349254172005
collins , you must marry . : 38.02619851370443
" implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character . : 1993.6966027108426
bennet and kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone mr . : 64.45135770809168
indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him , if you do not ." " you are over scrupulous surely . : 157.8618746630499
there was one part especially , the opening of it , which i should dread your having the power of reading again . : 371.50039178922066
bennet , " to walk to oakham mount this morning . : 191.06420485628453
bingley and jane !" was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs . : 1509.0546910983217
jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . : 428.75861095067967
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr . : 150.09417687811447
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves .-- we have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine ." " what think you of books ?" said he , smiling . : 462.9074594691598
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes . : 751.6707799706581
but does not jane correspond with the sister ? : 756.9537893681396
it was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long . : 93.74217955644276
i was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction ." " i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at pemberley . : 369.39575795148284
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy . : 557.8958230702397
the visit was returned in due form . : 934.1699467822372
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr . : 211.7160282245309
elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little . : 205.66414601983058
if mr . : 64.27150972081893
no principle of either , would be violated by my marriage with mr . : 543.1722913368773
wickham and the officers , mr . : 57.96367047271281
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene . : 310.9678528178462
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr . : 93.56893719171369
wickham began to speak on more general topics , meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry . : 753.4483821281012
much as i abominate writing , i would not give up mr . : 140.14595034254714
bennet , when elizabeth had read the note aloud , " if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr . : 202.83461255530383
do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ?" " i never heard that it was ." " and can you likewise declare , that there is no _foundation_ for it ?" " i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship . : 214.97983484750304
" he is the best landlord , and the best master ," said she , " that ever lived . : 85.10109434665718
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information . : 205.09152914941055
he was on one side of her mother . : 59.8693812799354
but in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable . : 482.19805291628484
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . : 261.1705432267597
believe her to be deceived by all means . : 139.98808465370323
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting . : 87.47403019002992
what are we to do !" would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe . : 2691.6666847634415
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one . : 147.80264675250004
in anticipating the happiness of bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house . : 182.83343832876753
elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr . : 75.6786173648777
there is a lady , it seems , a mrs . : 121.92038994027533
he had never had the slightest suspicion . : 468.740418586606
her ease and good spirits increased . : 721.8591160316023
we must not make him desperate ." the tumult of elizabeth ' s mind was allayed by this conversation . : 211.04647290898768
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you ." elizabeth ' s astonishment was beyond expression . : 149.74535280403563
miss bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth . : 386.62011844783035
it was in the times and the courier , i know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . : 186.30279872202198
regard for my sister ' s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to mr . : 698.5676889977631
darcy ' s letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart . : 212.55256292994534
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her . : 482.2069477793821
but we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger impulses even than pride ." " can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ?" " yes . : 461.33662326693644
philips , the lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called " mrs . : 155.06594884085723
he then handed her in , maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings . : 354.5101170840456
as for the gentleman himself , _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence . : 1278.6995904342873
collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . : 495.5864263685314
lady catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr . : 708.9874434196905
see <URL> transcriber ' s note : text enclosed by underscores is in italics ( _italics_ ). : 1142.3202538691091
collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and fourthly , that the match might be broken off . : 370.77693075287306
" what do you think ? : 97.11434309638277
elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last kitty did , she very innocently said , " what is the matter mamma ? : 265.1613502035567
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had i with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing . : 1408.6836915625952
what do you keep winking at me for ? : 320.39945027523635
darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage . : 141.85777185410515
you are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income ." " i hope not so . : 550.0136850363949
he did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september , than any body else in the country . : 219.04170722763106
he was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again . : 115.16522386614295
when the tea - things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother ' s rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party . : 258.5666696041979
the very last evening was spent there ; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh . : 432.1999162310841
darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley ! : 1297.7321098963669

he _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security . : 2752.5080419791584
hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves . : 324.4853653331064
from the drawing - room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to mr . : 84.12249357855364
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible . : 248.17066210868086
i believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses ." " my manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally i assure you . : 516.7273142405301
gardiner has done for them , because wickham has not sixpence of his own . : 278.23349576563714
" well , lizzy ," continued her mother soon afterwards , " and so the collinses live very comfortable , do they ? : 238.76115981188434
there ' s for you ! : 303.3532820031438
he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than _we_ had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us . : 171.610343195115
collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by charlotte ' s evident enjoyment of it , elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten . : 469.38467820739436
