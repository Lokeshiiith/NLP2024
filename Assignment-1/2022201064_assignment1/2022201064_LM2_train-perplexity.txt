However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.: 2.0541363302207865
"My dear Mr.: 3.0219585235465978
Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."  Mr.: 2.4915119942312334
Bennet made no answer.: 1.8727329760254054
"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."  This was invitation enough.: 3.215834581749809
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs.: 3.624677906122083
Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr.: 1.9913562218853222
Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."  "What is his name?"  "Bingley."  "Is he married or single?"  "Oh!: 2.271082857155131
A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year.: 1.635080098488887
how can it affect them?"  "My dear Mr.: 2.065408396312887
Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome!: 2.52283848711112
You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."  "Is that his design in settling here?"  "Design!: 2.5129961303768384
nonsense, how can you talk so!: 2.1779241549465684
You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr.: 1.9706985330279216
Bingley might like you the best of the party."  "My dear, you flatter me.: 2.4970738193260065
When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."  "In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."  "But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr.: 2.1652920635344817
Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."  "It is more than I engage for, I assure you."  "But consider your daughters.: 2.4652851223647816
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new comers.: 1.8489638772905512
Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not."  "You are over scrupulous surely.: 2.5281805659063723
Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."  "I desire you will do no such thing.: 2.094862015979289
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia.: 2.1836892441156333
But you are always giving _her_ the preference."  "They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."  "Mr.: 1.7898653258097537
Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?: 2.3348016062701293
You take delight in vexing me.: 1.859327856845858
You have no compassion on my poor nerves."  "You mistake me, my dear.: 2.518337355418546
I have a high respect for your nerves.: 1.8513463674302921
They are my old friends.: 1.2682537590880343
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."  "Ah!: 1.6266315604971073
you do not know what I suffer."  "But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."  "It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not visit them."  "Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all."  Mr.: 2.591671347318335
Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.: 1.8060492381489859
_Her_ mind was less difficult to develope.: 1.6263470692664697
The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.: 1.94538140167446
CHAPTER II.: 1.063151314611428
He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it.: 2.234630445459637
It was then disclosed in the following manner.: 3.187877596115187
Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with,  "I hope Mr.: 2.2599459336836936
Bingley will like it Lizzy."  "We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr.: 2.108047155933228
Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit."  "But you forget, mama," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs.: 2.5371086330415693
Long has promised to introduce him."  "I do not believe Mrs.: 2.8009520122951397
Long will do any such thing.: 1.5349684456116075
She has two nieces of her own.: 2.130974631673535
She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her."  "No more have I," said Mr.: 2.588101149428352
Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you."  Mrs.: 2.7741466119948894
Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.: 2.001934672594069
"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake!: 1.982735952832991
Have a little compassion on my nerves.: 2.07671767475047
You tear them to pieces."  "Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times them ill."  "I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully.: 1.9410878942142393
Long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself."  "Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr.: 2.673968856329615
Bingley to _her_."  "Impossible, Mr.: 1.445757839038304
Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teazing?"  "I honour your circumspection.: 2.208339876604428
A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little.: 1.7336568899965088
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight.: 1.7912031151575587
But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs.: 1.6528296322879834
Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself."  The girls stared at their father.: 1.9623495132199735
Bennet said only, "Nonsense, nonsense!"  "What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he.: 1.976986902979261
"Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense?: 2.3593039773186484
I cannot quite agree with you _there_.: 1.4246879992986092
What say you, Mary?: 5.5604216730452904
"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr.: 1.939713387261608
Bingley."  "I am sick of Mr.: 3.506887559604838
Bingley," cried his wife.: 4.41857784769184
"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before?: 2.509765039888575
If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on him.: 2.5532918507746936
It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now."  The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.: 1.9348635129081269
Bennet!: 12.832855048281306
But I knew I should persuade you at last.: 1.898483574181387
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance.: 1.6340046183010657
Well, how pleased I am!: 1.5424887505269897
and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now."  "Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr.: 2.5773428818361137
"What an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was shut.: 2.8191414827681895
"I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter.: 1.9480757794758816
At our time of life, it is not so pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing.: 2.209464608532262
Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare say Mr.: 2.035979949467479
Bingley will dance with you at the next ball."  "Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the youngest, I'm the tallest."  The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr.: 2.318164453357699
Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.: 2.316217150079865
CHAPTER III.: 1.063151314611428
Not all that Mrs.: 1.4014146631884525
Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr.: 2.141896247615578
Her report was highly favourable.: 1.3874409490380144
Sir William had been delighted with him.: 1.5168694149208861
He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party.: 2.4862027705277776
Nothing could be more delightful!: 2.6645780407133928
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr.: 1.653155625075234
Bingley's heart were entertained.: 7.6837954846751595
"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield," said Mrs.: 2.186028917682126
Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for."  In a few days Mr.: 2.9432084373594103
Bingley returned Mr.: 1.0444095627939656
Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library.: 2.775807326534229
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.: 2.1083576941112296
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.: 2.1312358967477856
Bennet was quite disconcerted.: 1.9693834857835706
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.: 2.2911977570373065
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr.: 1.9304599840427392
Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.: 1.838931724644933
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin.: 1.757403576669785
And when the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five altogether; Mr.: 1.608033902534926
Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.: 1.7929637705620096
Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.: 1.9723603577569015
His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.: 2.0139933490643913
His brother-in-law, Mr.: 1.631740268805571
Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.: 2.048041428199422
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr.: 2.1129917821398303
Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.: 2.111835962086502
Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.: 1.82333596297946
What a contrast between him and his friend!: 2.129097059157649
Darcy danced only once with Mrs.: 1.4021648882005693
Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.: 2.299672021185188
His character was decided.: 2.175073059098136
He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.: 2.9447727222123894
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs.: 1.4070520836047813
Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his having slighted one of her daughters.: 1.9170164327989587
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.: 2.0386660091324496
Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr.: 2.004516953657615
Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.: 2.602456873313283
"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance.: 3.202693815097172
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.: 1.588509192188555
You had much better dance."  "I certainly shall not.: 2.455512104964597
You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner.: 1.6588004180130602
Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with."  "I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Bingley, "for a kingdom!: 2.7640383107944997
Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty."  "_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr.: 2.0905785047186383
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.: 2.0039452734009857
she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!: 1.8358282135983055
But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say, very agreeable.: 2.592094493983534
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you."  "Which do you mean?" and turning round, he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, "She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.: 2.008108599944796
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."  Mr.: 1.9084118013228784
Bingley followed his advice.: 1.3781848415703926
Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.: 1.798899267333465
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.: 1.564797958129848
Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.: 2.6000299511205913
Jane was as much gratified by this, as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.: 2.5764536153442457
Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure.: 2.8965511827063124
They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.: 1.979363117815319
They found Mr.: 1.0444095627939656
Bennet still up.: 1.268884731127202
He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear.: 2.058716631112741
my dear Mr.: 1.0147943849618424
Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.: 2.3902658294309784
I wish you had been there.: 2.184422269097029
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.: 1.6760017745542246
Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice.: 1.5617188074472619
Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time.: 2.2826460126406767
First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.: 2.1981724386239785
I was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance.: 2.5522853324172408
So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.: 2.007735788784401
Then, the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger----"  "If he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much!: 2.6161260883148034
For God's sake, say no more of his partners.: 2.1830063937136464
my dear," continued Mrs.: 2.2817374815574243
Bennet, "I am quite delighted with him.: 4.304574285775709
and his sisters are charming women.: 1.8132655376958184
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses.: 2.0407535194467203
I dare say the lace upon Mrs.: 2.5663212090917664
Hurst's gown----"  Here she was interrupted again.: 1.4192848272220537
Bennet protested against any description of finery.: 1.306016409965329
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr.: 1.9181533334243481
"But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing.: 2.346803892752301
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him!: 2.082322479473787
He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great!: 2.0930080081961573
Not handsome enough to dance with!: 1.9980766856112668
I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set downs.: 2.6399785164215275
I quite detest the man."     CHAPTER IV.: 1.4194868116801265
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr.: 2.048594140465445
Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him.: 2.4307704875278957
"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!"  "He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can.: 2.38963943604822
I did not expect such a compliment."  "Did not you?: 2.7940932605168616
_I_ did for you.: 1.4603033187586416
But that is one great difference between us.: 1.9478077744103601
Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.: 1.5067107781154112
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room.: 2.0471860786627003
No thanks to his gallantry for that.: 1.6112530187173293
Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.: 2.265498100493146
You have liked many a stupider person."  "Dear Lizzy!"  "Oh!: 1.680050332155116
you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.: 2.564473980989345
You never see a fault in any body.: 1.5386841825236637
All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes.: 1.7560656787256073
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life."  "I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak what I think."  "I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.: 2.6146758608520075
Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every where.: 1.4569002307824754
But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad--belongs to you alone.: 2.1192378812539308
And so, you like this man's sisters too, do you?: 2.17732159945059
Their manners are not equal to his."  "Certainly not; at first.: 2.0385477903833467
They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others.: 2.13688859030544
They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.: 1.9813056314815016
Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it.--Mr.: 2.0015243722333462
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs.: 2.4137548841070386
Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.: 1.7536785083105468
Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House.: 1.9987118324658424
He did look at it and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.: 1.8442486770282285
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character.--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied.: 2.056604378733976
On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion.: 2.221619306642674
Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever.: 1.8833248398803049
He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.: 2.0331462952048245
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence.: 1.5359370097724876
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic.: 1.8214413206635474
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.: 2.2035159376761047
Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure.: 1.8174144802402898
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of.: 2.362581960758985
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.: 1.9657413799591863
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate.: 1.6349827887219408
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty.: 2.1168893057116938
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.: 1.2744521227227608
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.: 2.0417881904348363
For though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to every body.: 2.179431523172894
By nature inoffensive, friendly and obliging, his presentation at St.: 1.3323867754290493
James's had made him courteous.: 2.078151375000494
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs.: 2.0509923321947467
Bennet.--They had several children.: 1.3933571688075648
The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth's intimate friend.: 1.8951733299693583
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.: 2.082410032324699
"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs.: 1.555281817106183
Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas.: 2.0900108278727734
"_You_ were Mr.: 1.362588431949803
Bingley's first choice."  "Yes;--but he seemed to like his second better."  "Oh!--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice.: 2.5428984109347317
Robinson; did not I mention it to you?: 1.9795854500710726
Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest?: 2.3780248291941684
and his answering immediately to the last question--Oh!: 1.697566940859059
the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point."  "Upon my word!--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know."  "_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza," said Charlotte.: 1.860302802453563
"Mr.: 1.0319113630282717
Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_."  "I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.: 2.0989099129742073
Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips."  "Are you quite sure, Ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?" said Jane.--"I certainly saw Mr.: 1.7724187208116853
Darcy speaking to her."  "Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to."  "Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance.: 2.2308353784333836
With _them_ he is remarkably agreeable."  "I do not believe a word of it, my dear.: 2.8881778682671784
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs.: 2.666449612794354
Long.: 5.468462457546313
But I can guess how it was; every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs.: 2.3127459477934353
Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise."  "I do not mind his not talking to Mrs.: 2.351285442198553
Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I wish he had danced with Eliza."  "Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with _him_, if I were you."  "I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him."  "His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it.: 2.4743107205486594
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour, should think highly of himself.: 2.0978054938977717
If I may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud."  "That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_."  "Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, "is a very common failing I believe.: 2.1653968708538742
By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary.: 2.2850585932292593
Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonimously.: 1.5987225012279838
A person may be proud without being vain.: 1.4737502352553737
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."  "If I were as rich as Mr.: 1.8606590482415681
Darcy," cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters, "I should not care how proud I was.: 2.2131005757942113
I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day."  "Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs.: 2.0968646850194106
Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly."  The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.: 2.225065160691277
CHAPTER VI.: 1.0767509623679594
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.: 1.7490584540357244
The visit was returned in due form.: 1.4710404508939776
Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs.: 1.7714561564334472
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the two eldest.: 1.9365421021038869
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.: 2.1675167950338223
It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.: 2.2316057937366387
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.: 2.8936633659460935
"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded.: 2.739180854121896
If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark.: 2.1966633539607234
We can all _begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.: 1.779350089083987
In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels.: 1.535678300454481
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."  "But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.: 2.259108156467152
If _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too."  "Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do."  "But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out."  "Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.: 2.4657537053349396
Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention.: 1.8529651891878898
When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses."  "Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.: 2.19881562267968
But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.: 2.232003611607429
As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness.: 2.1375057333738137
She has known him only a fortnight.: 1.5582820795598369
This is not quite enough to make her understand his character."  "Not as you represent it.: 2.3097457464722932
Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal."  "Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded."  "Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth.: 2.2518509516629184
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.: 1.6154058108513272
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life."  "You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.: 2.016162001061064
You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."  Occupied in observing Mr.: 2.2136151752651125
Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.: 2.830786003222513
Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.: 2.2510865790315573
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.: 1.9229894116733877
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.: 1.3699712296691353
Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.: 2.318289528751229
Of this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.: 1.9191503211944103
He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.: 2.7474931555593787
It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were assembled.: 3.0408401646206955
"What does Mr.: 2.154589016849074
Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?"  "That is a question which Mr.: 2.2501252303213937
Darcy only can answer."  "But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about.: 2.628480069745274
"I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows."  "You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body!--If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers." On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, she added, "Very well; if it must be so, it must." And gravely glancing at Mr.: 2.299801360830258
Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of course familiar with--'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and I shall keep mine to swell my song."  Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.: 1.903040071049166
After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.: 1.9818041355335443
Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.: 1.8262538706103095
Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.: 2.1698981641127832
"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr.: 1.8777784011466467
Darcy!--There is nothing like dancing after all.--I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies."  "Certainly, Sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world.--Every savage can dance."  Sir William only smiled.: 1.9492081174994282
"Your friend performs delightfully;" he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;--"and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.: 1.98309304776754
Darcy."  "You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir."  "Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.: 2.445243681709001
Do you often dance at St.: 1.2984311503438335
Darcy bowed.: 13.92764585659805
"I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas."  He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her,  "My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?--Mr.: 2.1442741840391437
Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you." And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr.: 2.043150815860443
Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,  "Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.--I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."  Mr.: 2.230212832051207
Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.: 1.823393701492235
"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half hour."  "Mr.: 2.3121484283294014
Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling.: 3.383732950494223
"He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner?"  Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.: 1.959779761834042
Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,  "I can guess the subject of your reverie."  "I should imagine not."  "You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.: 2.3604064358596477
The insipidity and yet the noise; the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--What would I give to hear your strictures on them!"  "Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.: 1.8672771763260627
My mind was more agreeably engaged.: 1.4814071775440816
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."  Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.: 1.896702101363554
Darcy replied with great intrepidity,  "Miss Elizabeth Bennet."  "Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley.: 2.9791242617663363
"I am all astonishment.: 5.245165068551347
How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am I to wish you joy?"  "That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.: 1.9484929180833632
A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.: 1.7870638994319554
I knew you would be wishing me joy."  "Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled.: 2.2396897639731153
You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you."  He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.: 2.263264197297198
CHAPTER VII.: 1.0767509623679594
Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his.: 2.2055305547972797
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.: 2.1644485457890363
Philips, who had been a clerk to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.: 2.5900943489085635
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way.: 1.9007206739473865
The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt.: 1.744196448134863
At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the head quarters.: 2.102284017918638
Their visits to Mrs.: 1.2651444600788035
Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence.: 2.790736428230113
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections.: 1.6885296280539026
Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves.: 2.1534056329739353
Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.: 2.173199076699213
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.: 1.7057170640608732
Bennet coolly observed,  "From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country.: 2.4156231398703687
Bennet, "that you should be so ready to think your own children silly.: 2.9962326402648656
I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish."  "My dear Mr.: 1.9648907474732742
Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother.--When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.: 2.1239559419571385
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals."  "Mama," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library."  Mrs.: 1.8411430587245448
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer.: 2.0653320277888985
Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,  "Well, Jane, who is it from?: 2.7979355923026956
what is it about?: 2.675443685646182
what does he say?: 1.93229271198719
Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."  "It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud.: 2.6878617189444394
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of      this.: 2.296960141776273
Yours ever,       "CAROLINE BINGLEY."  "With the officers!" cried Lydia.: 2.4082418739620586
"I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_."  "Dining out," said Mrs.: 1.7137779398608879
"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night."  "That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home."  "Oh!: 2.405391814800079
but the gentlemen will have Mr.: 1.449010207700829
Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs."  "I had much rather go in the coach."  "But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.: 2.555713372443272
They are wanted in the farm, Mr.: 1.3617840944023538
Bennet, are not they?"  "They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them."  "But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose will be answered."  She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged.: 2.1996549234973664
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day.: 2.262034159127007
Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard.: 1.915767616591146
Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.: 2.966980853173161
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back.: 1.6293181851033423
Bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.: 2.1796981129762028
Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance.: 3.3314959676132525
Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:       "My dearest Lizzy,       "I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be      imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.: 2.0226993183197917
They insist also on      my seeing Mr.: 1.3123212267913638
Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear      of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache      there is not much the matter with me.: 2.127464205258569
"Yours, &c."  "Well, my dear," said Mr.: 2.6297256737441703
Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr.: 2.3797923029264503
I am not at all afraid of her dying.: 2.8615626162693175
People do not die of little trifling colds.: 1.440372344936507
She will be taken good care of.: 2.087377063513115
As long as she stays there, it is all very well.: 2.9567246842453163
I would go and see her, if I could have the carriage."  Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking was her only alternative.: 2.605915265117296
She declared her resolution.: 6.459238844374419
"How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt!: 2.9081770611360995
You will not be fit to be seen when you get there."  "I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want."  "Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the horses?"  "No, indeed.: 2.500989098582874
I do not wish to avoid the walk.: 3.8862775311078375
The distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles.: 1.5461300854097175
I shall be back by dinner."  "I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."  "We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and Lydia.--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.: 2.123145097730599
"If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes."  In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.: 2.08834581534682
She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.--That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs.: 1.9791187635872651
She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--Mr.: 2.2073150103323718
Hurst nothing at all.: 2.0483899173368294
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone.: 1.8777041996575563
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.: 1.5533666340400543
Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room.: 2.1623831048585522
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.: 1.8876028483059628
She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with.: 2.0776147443301802
Elizabeth silently attended her.: 1.4513469443312859
When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane.: 2.253355227831545
The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.: 2.4732414272466103
The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.: 1.916577262349497
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere.: 1.9879241337510944
When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very unwillingly said so.: 2.0116562448352715
Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.: 1.7084602221572298
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.: 1.8201625354619195
To the civil enquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr.: 1.97285836393576
Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer.: 3.749756678441466
Jane was by no means better.: 2.4086061762852293
His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others.: 1.9735006750794142
She had very little notice from any but him.: 1.4429375326007168
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr.: 2.019298139682639
Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.: 2.2178292326748976
When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.: 2.635499424070369
Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.: 2.0167883812577045
Hurst thought the same, and added,  "She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker.: 2.3394933231970434
I shall never forget her appearance this morning.: 1.7870634226958706
She really looked almost wild."  "She did indeed, Louisa.: 1.81207194397237
I could hardly keep my countenance.: 1.8424105190596116
Very nonsensical to come at all!: 1.8008474400927175
Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!"  "Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it, not doing its office."  "Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but this was all lost upon me.: 2.2128663022693202
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well, when she came into the room this morning.: 2.2534901411115973
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice."  "_You_ observed it, Mr.: 1.4438531702867217
Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition."  "Certainly not."  "To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!: 2.289122769745048
what could she mean by it?: 1.5962008095467564
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country town indifference to decorum."  "It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said Bingley.: 2.055016625431453
"I am afraid, Mr.: 3.8799367679562153
Darcy," observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes."  "Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise."--A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs.: 2.294185033562515
Hurst began again.: 19.106836955673117
"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled.: 2.335387754592719
But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it."  "I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton."  "Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."  "That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.: 2.7042862805540056
"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it would not make them one jot less agreeable."  "But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world," replied Darcy.: 2.3243826551150777
To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.: 1.9973269004894951
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.: 2.0273522431654114
She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself.: 2.601715312880825
Hurst looked at her with astonishment.: 5.708004414459097
"Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather singular."  "Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards.: 2.7422228122663603
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else."  "I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things."  "In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; "and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well."  Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying.: 2.306785754328541
He immediately offered to fetch her others; all that his library afforded.: 2.0689254915112945
"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever look into."  Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.: 2.2996650331390645
"I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left so small a collection of books.--What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr.: 2.2519012378237457
Darcy!"  "It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many generations."  "And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books."  "I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these."  "Neglect!: 2.2024544774350048
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place.: 1.8736691800858958
Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley."  "I wish it may."  "But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.: 2.235026423829828
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire."  "With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it."  "I am talking of possibilities, Charles."  "Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation."  Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr.: 2.0868451278281035
"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "will she be as tall as I am?"  "I think she will.: 2.277175857360407
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or rather taller."  "How I long to see her again!: 2.3715375667642316
I never met with anybody who delighted me so much.: 1.6276593757084585
Such a countenance, such manners!: 1.5851570697152944
Her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite."  "It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished, as they all are."  "All young ladies accomplished!: 2.2621050175985675
They all paint tables, cover skreens and net purses.: 3.014545462819169
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished."  "Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has too much truth.: 2.356420372552758
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen.: 2.008208255770821
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.: 2.166962014437986
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished."  "Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley.: 2.2264831851195863
certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with.: 1.8906402655491426
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved."  "All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading."  "I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.: 1.9908206589178594
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_."  "Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all this?"  "_I_ never saw such a woman.: 2.2507086723499032
_I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united."  Mrs.: 2.199530108645711
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr.: 1.6144175592376213
As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.: 1.9101824072974631
"Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds.: 2.541154945928257
But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."  "Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, "there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.: 2.057945826875923
Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable."  Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.: 2.157990874631256
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her.: 2.7630548948012454
Bingley urged Mr.: 1.0444095627939656
Jones's being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians.: 1.8899686422392823
This, she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that Mr.: 2.967180542217647
Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable.: 1.8253429413162467
They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.: 1.9268153095487874
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr.: 2.324610271012278
Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters.: 2.1709251442168567
The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.: 1.4116326982717997
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs.: 1.4362765126223687
Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.: 1.9585087116430373
After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour.: 1.9868801815970332
Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs.: 1.4221895934068018
Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.: 1.9988289294691697
"Indeed I have, Sir," was her answer.: 3.5562839199184895
"She is a great deal too ill to be moved.: 2.4829430413062687
Jones says we must not think of moving her.: 1.997050087025181
We must trespass a little longer on your kindness."  "Removed!" cried Bingley.: 1.5754933708887682
Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.: 4.041146275543564
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_.: 1.4706571266786286
Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk.: 2.4252952717062506
At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here."  "That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth.: 2.961229596001075
"You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her.: 2.1570460962177838
yes--I understand you perfectly."  "I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful."  "That is as it happens.: 2.28703703974496
It must be an amusing study."  "Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.: 2.2541793703443664
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society."  "But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever."  "Yes, indeed," cried Mrs.: 2.0524804038226754
Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.: 2.2433727657487874
"I assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town."  Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away.: 2.276910206705903
"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part, except the shops and public places.: 2.0474235463769177
The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr.: 1.9883339308901864
Bingley?"  "When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same.: 3.003071012940538
They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."  "Aye--that is because you have the right disposition.: 1.9847960940686018
But that gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing at all."  "Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother.: 2.8200531657444277
"You quite mistook Mr.: 2.1399043782534415
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true."  "Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger.: 2.1631668837959115
I know we dine with four and twenty families."  Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance.: 1.5057445328427177
His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards Mr.: 1.5946645576774225
Darcy with a very expressive smile.: 1.7605743429529006
Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.: 2.141812101412626
"Yes, she called yesterday with her father.: 2.6799935284822918
What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr.: 1.4408104731157942
Bingley--is not he?: 1.4544982008673375
so much the man of fashion!: 2.2132529156745413
so genteel and so easy!--He has always something to say to every body.--_That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter."  "Did Charlotte dine with you?"  "No, she would go home.: 1.9151292096756012
I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies.: 1.8855399289455366
For my part, Mr.: 1.930926433396078
Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently.: 1.3975202072522355
But every body is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I assure you.: 2.1400206600509186
It is a pity they are not handsome!: 3.079827047515165
Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend."  "She seems a very pleasant young woman," said Bingley.: 1.81039534080459
dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain.: 2.1216911152013527
I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see any body better looking.: 2.389112109221129
It is what every body says.: 2.3129911721968224
When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.: 2.5337501604086485
But however he did not.: 2.8141877026301376
Perhaps he thought her too young.: 3.6123032170758957
"There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.: 2.045657612102141
I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"  "I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said Darcy.: 2.651151971073143
"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.: 2.1006935939125357
Every thing nourishes what is strong already.: 1.8670366466851565
But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."  Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.: 1.8589598782379082
She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.: 2.9574427189262646
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr.: 1.3302974845983324
Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy.: 2.4251591844302856
Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required.: 1.7891962681362201
Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.: 1.8751049893260499
Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.: 1.7663315061439555
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr.: 2.4849923072028024
Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.: 1.7916121354870822
Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age.: 1.8554897222338087
She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.: 2.169791533806891
She was very equal therefore to address Mr.: 1.6832127342226921
Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.: 2.478323539339486
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.: 2.08050137169964
But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill."  Lydia declared herself satisfied.: 1.802438489965659
yes--it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again.: 2.064581190875632
I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."  Mrs.: 2.0638463418782145
Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr.: 1.9958930518920708
Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.: 2.564683014464205
CHAPTER X.: 1.046627341480735
The day passed much as the day before had done.: 2.264047931919522
The loo table, however, did not appear.: 3.663692285151657
Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister.: 2.2628726735217564
Hurst and Mr.: 1.0217224393791593
Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.: 3.2673376298125962
Hurst was observing their game.: 1.259424809719264
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion.: 2.073632887970492
The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each.: 2.129375540636366
I write rather slowly."  "How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year!: 1.889543025345796
Letters of business too!: 1.3914102076891084
How odious I should think them!"  "It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours."  "Pray tell your sister that I long to see her."  "I have already told her so once, by your desire."  "I am afraid you do not like your pen.: 2.460479114727397
Let me mend it for you.: 1.4638148835052864
I mend pens remarkably well."  "Thank you--but I always mend my own."  "How can you contrive to write so even?"  He was silent.: 1.965536206572416
"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's."  "Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?--At present I have not room to do them justice."  "Oh!: 2.192313332133631
it is of no consequence.: 2.0677611015875295
I shall see her in January.: 2.36691971714763
But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr.: 1.8168301827707363
He studies too much for words of four syllables.--Do not you, Darcy?"  "My style of writing is very different from yours."  "Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable.: 2.220855180277529
He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."  "My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."  "Your humility, Mr.: 2.0459350021321017
Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."  "Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of humility.: 2.208178050927662
It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast."  "And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"  "The indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting.: 1.7572267986145618
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance.: 2.192646428515053
When you told Mrs.: 1.602594281345592
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?"  "Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning.: 1.9702671507187444
And yet, upon my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment.: 2.24083146306508
At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies."  "I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity.: 2.4866514016040573
Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not go--and, at another word, might stay a month."  "You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr.: 2.136177423694079
Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition.: 2.24363856980146
You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself."  "I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.: 2.042558587994434
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could."  "Would Mr.: 2.1508343106815584
Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"  "Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for himself."  "You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged.: 2.11461519775238
Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety."  "To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you."  "To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either."  "You appear to me, Mr.: 2.148334578308126
Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection.: 1.7578256360301296
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr.: 2.257422308206014
We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon.: 1.938451192840097
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"  "Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?"  "By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of.: 1.9771061133546977
I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference.: 2.2661513490162246
I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do."  Mr.: 2.0063381122533936
Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh.: 2.3098978690625525
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.: 2.038393415846268
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."  "What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.: 2.4019283989030082
Darcy had much better finish his letter."  Mr.: 1.8341410485414147
Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.: 1.867291899892419
When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music.: 2.098658200822141
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.: 1.8318446181167132
Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr.: 2.0414791012533184
Darcy's eyes were fixed on her.: 2.8155885177673095
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange.: 2.2495091550258133
The supposition did not pain her.: 1.4368148072940778
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr.: 1.9059473998196512
Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her--  "Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?"  She smiled, but made no answer.: 2.1961443202049753
He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.: 2.4493732827697
"Oh!" said she, "I heard you before; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply.: 2.8495478922606154
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if you dare."  "Indeed I do not dare."  Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.: 2.1678642795860905
He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.: 1.9290894476380522
Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.: 2.105851557000023
"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after the officers.--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses."  "Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"  "Oh!: 2.1278357436184376
yes.--Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley.: 1.8542522642263128
Put them next to your great uncle the judge.: 1.4664672526283782
They are in the same profession, you know; only in different lines.: 2.227819984156922
Hurst and Elizabeth herself.: 6.223711768101282
"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.: 3.0045319694600843
"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs.: 1.3994046962855098
Hurst, "in running away without telling us that you were coming out."  Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr.: 1.6521827556564763
Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said,--  "This walk is not wide enough for our party.: 1.4173531187584354
We had better go into the avenue."  But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered,  "No, no; stay where you are.--You are charmingly group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage.: 2.135803971234995
Good bye."  She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two.: 2.0265642353230455
Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.: 1.5917029181170048
CHAPTER XI.: 1.046627341480735
When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.: 2.1789218034461335
Their powers of conversation were considerable.: 1.4237282849074993
They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.: 1.6574332883664902
But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object.: 2.218670403220695
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr.: 2.501538864892735
Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation.: 2.0121630469050253
He was full of joy and attention.: 1.3430819609763616
He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.: 2.5210722640673078
Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.: 1.6885044935277278
When tea was over, Mr.: 2.064385454668591
Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table--but in vain.: 1.7980438834269479
She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.: 1.2005238309150708
Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr.: 1.6328836991823463
Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected.: 1.3177653367977196
She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her.: 2.5853659671171543
Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs.: 1.5832925793654469
Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.: 1.9493162726337818
She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on.: 2.821329428345516
At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way!: 2.234433346464495
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!: 1.844099786028248
How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book!--When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library."  No one made any reply.: 2.2950265741287725
She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said,  "By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield?--I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure."  "If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards."  "I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.: 2.103472287579019
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day."  "Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball."  Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room.: 2.1645461609649614
Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.: 2.3746923240648603
In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to Elizabeth, said,  "Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room.--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude."  Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.: 2.4142057019006242
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr.: 1.6977025465089057
Darcy looked up.: 1.6091995130309107
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.: 1.7214613994471628
He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing, that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere.: 1.9208570203364446
"What could he mean?: 8.266863405514448
"Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing about it."  Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr.: 2.3128658084370777
Darcy in any thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives.: 2.862847216661842
"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak.: 2.614609712236583
shocking!" cried Miss Bingley.: 2.160757675441952
How shall we punish him for such a speech?"  "Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth.: 2.331860573424296
"We can all plague and punish one another.: 1.6983027317291908
Teaze him--laugh at him.--Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."  "But upon my honour I do _not_.: 2.3271974586578104
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_.: 1.7174800461674362
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind!: 1.712563514805084
And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.: 1.8801803918027573
Darcy may hug himself."  "Mr.: 1.9870854571145966
I dearly love a laugh."  "Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be.: 2.1202444246846737
The wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions, may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke."  "Certainly," replied Elizabeth--"there are such people, but I hope I am not one of _them_.: 2.0871201170368034
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good.: 1.5447071767455591
Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can.--But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without."  "Perhaps that is not possible for any one.: 2.1649028574915232
But pride--where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."  Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.: 2.174495402023955
"Your examination of Mr.: 1.2953207698358304
Darcy has no defect.: 1.4831702096698816
He owns it himself without disguise."  "No"--said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension.: 2.1981161469561825
I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.: 2.2013034559611495
My temper I dare not vouch for.--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the convenience of the world.: 1.6707189034071306
I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself.: 1.912274437713225
My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.: 1.734794971291797
My temper would perhaps be called resentful.--My good opinion once lost is lost for ever."  "_That_ is a failing indeed!"--cried Elizabeth.: 1.78393277981712
"Implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character.: 2.258160610570842
But you have chosen your fault well.--I really cannot _laugh_ at it.: 1.6025308743588944
You are safe from me."  "There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."  "And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body."  "And yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand them."  "Do let us have a little music,"--cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share.--"Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr.: 2.2142598927733954
Hurst."  Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for it.: 2.3288333259923113
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.: 1.8421456604623907
CHAPTER XII.: 1.046627341480735
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day.: 2.1577360629773565
Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before.: 2.080039817866322
Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home.: 2.8479278629261318
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr.: 2.043520597401051
Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well.--Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr.: 1.9297518260692956
Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.: 2.4290097724013138
The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred.: 1.7862368525406136
To Mr.: 1.1036130641772124
Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough.: 1.8992666846543238
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it.: 1.7354228275208932
Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.: 2.1741834348093914
On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place.: 1.6445072228522724
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.--Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits.: 2.1116216533857335
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.: 1.8220573853858955
The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.: 2.1958710438958997
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort.: 1.8799134806983377
Much had been done, and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.: 2.2734241954665215
CHAPTER XIII.: 1.0767509623679594
Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party."  "Who do you mean, my dear?: 2.652365490368571
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her.: 2.167713094464711
I do not believe she often sees such at home."  "The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger." Mrs.: 2.1975689810185224
Bennet's eyes sparkled.--"A gentleman and a stranger!: 2.2661918420058207
It is Mr.: 1.0352148747964613
Bingley I am sure.: 5.918197013888337
Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.: 3.093158150228832
how unlucky!: 1.644911442488942
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.: 2.0018585988762254
Lydia, my love, ring the bell.: 1.8578783581400156
I must speak to Hill, this moment."  "It is _not_ Mr.: 2.1624190796989597
Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life."  This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.: 2.314609477826433
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.: 2.1979942271350392
"About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention.: 1.9808174081220604
Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."  "Oh!: 2.4679528259501122
my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.: 3.100023375543165
Pray do not talk of that odious man.: 1.7232891434784798
I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it."  Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.: 2.5233690621375455
They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs.: 2.32838044911507
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.: 2.0552053673771087
"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr.: 2.093485999293265
Bennet, "and nothing can clear Mr.: 2.7004811987197477
But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself."  "No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.: 2.958086171738808
Bennet."--My mind however is now made up on      the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been      so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right      Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh,      whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable      rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to      demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be      ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are      instituted by the Church of England.: 1.9816730216677134
As a clergyman, moreover, I      feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in      all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds      I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly      commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the      entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,      and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch.: 1.983723134637754
I cannot be      otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your      amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to      assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but      of this hereafter.: 1.9796668555725347
If you should have no objection to receive me      into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on      you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and      shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday      se'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as      Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a      Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the      duty of the day.: 1.8069976861583417
I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to      your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,       WILLIAM COLLINS."  "At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman," said Mr.: 1.8783226370316264
Bennet, as he folded up the letter.: 5.139108824327591
"He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again."  "There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him."  "Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit."  Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.: 2.2617229595098176
"I cannot make him out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he would help it, if he could.--Can he be a sensible man, sir?"  "No, my dear; I think not.: 2.0119709801016183
I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse.: 1.6743093318248043
There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well.: 2.5545512666516963
I am impatient to see him."  "In point of composition," said Mary, "his letter does not seem defective.: 2.5148886021253576
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed."  To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting.: 1.878940990553055
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.: 1.8941041487093517
Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which astonished her husband and daughters.: 2.2703726869776575
Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family.: 2.422353680980324
Bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr.: 2.1570883476809177
Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.: 1.6294222565680003
He was a tall, heavy looking young man of five and twenty.: 1.9631887293240102
He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs.: 2.127196993027612
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but Mrs.: 2.8647999466655603
Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,  "You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough.: 2.354444520650056
Things are settled so oddly."  "You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate."  "Ah!: 2.3378283657829098
sir, I do indeed.: 4.25416242836886
Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things I know are all chance in this world.: 1.7058232390396262
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed."  "I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate.: 2.3158388295520473
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them.: 1.992560855158349
At present I will not say more, but perhaps when we are better acquainted----"  He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other.: 2.103510990004127
They were not the only objects of Mr.: 2.0677040497204957
Collins's admiration.: 4.788066421532317
The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs.: 2.164319917635327
Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.: 1.9576248339940643
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery was owing.: 1.8630476539759078
But here he was set right by Mrs.: 1.3150626390075089
Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.: 2.8518408817835885
He begged pardon for having displeased her.: 1.3854973516983216
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.: 1.9267062031315108
CHAPTER XIV.: 1.046627341480735
Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.: 2.117793030336398
Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable.: 1.8248830548723516
Bennet could not have chosen better.: 3.369167439382733
The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine.: 2.122020559920755
She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of preaching before her.: 2.7899949961129877
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.: 1.8644786696385036
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.: 2.113699224937596
"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs.: 2.633906095274533
Bennet, "and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman.: 3.685211692174886
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her.: 1.902707017611378
Does she live near you, sir?"  "The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence."  "I think you said she was a widow, sir?: 1.9878848551541601
has she any family?"  "She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property."  "Ah!" cried Mrs.: 2.193213027719262
Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than many girls.: 1.5752181228850735
And what sort of young lady is she?: 1.9434598089781077
is she handsome?"  "She is a most charming young lady indeed.: 2.179318621792675
Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth.: 1.7516655511088368
She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them.: 1.9346911887529963
But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."  "Has she been presented?: 1.8475109988773017
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court."  "Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament.: 1.9127906354530895
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies.: 1.9661744944554163
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her.--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay."  "You judge very properly," said Mr.: 2.237266160946817
Bennet, "and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.: 2.538664970694085
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?"  "They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible."  Mr.: 1.7977843214048532
Bennet's expectations were fully answered.: 2.2082194109644044
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.: 1.9813652039689704
Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.: 2.157642987262648
Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels.--Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed.--Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons.: 1.9029282075376408
Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with,  "Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard, and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.: 2.1592427644677175
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday.: 1.6997228987212503
I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr.: 2.683692532144403
Denny comes back from town."  Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.: 1.8020703852356863
Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,  "I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.: 1.8806202645368546
It amazes me, I confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction.: 2.038191149568273
But I will no longer importune my young cousin."  Then turning to Mr.: 1.7920358390553235
Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon.: 1.6670157948772217
Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.: 1.848528824194729
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr.: 2.166553197382065
Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr.: 1.526137118947936
Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.: 2.3973648108932046
Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance.: 2.2724818550913986
The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity.: 2.0480981479029485
Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.: 2.10317316348118
This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.: 1.8957431711989585
Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.--"As to her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her _eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."  Mr.: 1.8896114459561004
Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon done--done while Mrs.: 1.7690945075899542
Bennet was stirring the fire.: 3.5149825386687334
Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.: 1.4815170807682763
Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces.: 2.461158988849508
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr.: 2.1100330411372976
Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr.: 1.91044861919856
Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr.: 2.526890108690288
Collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.: 2.385110971713023
Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.: 2.678173831750067
Such doings discomposed Mr.: 1.111183138560443
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr.: 2.15233294407742
Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr.: 1.6010833928467525
Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go.: 1.613793876874123
In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.: 1.8414155239228744
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recal them.: 1.795266282802945
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way.: 2.0653858081148546
The officer was the very Mr.: 1.4644323705291107
Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed.: 1.8495187245545766
All were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot.: 1.805912051646266
Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr.: 2.180232275046354
Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps.: 2.2494236963888667
This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.: 2.1058418215601344
His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.: 1.9360913869884067
On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities.: 2.106549418292645
Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.: 2.1654688284214947
Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red.: 1.5851047814930133
Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr.: 1.7590505803338539
Darcy just deigned to return.: 1.381609628285512
What could be the meaning of it?--It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.: 2.351683102082025
In another minute Mr.: 1.1453813624225126
Denny and Mr.: 1.0217224393791593
Philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the invitation.: 1.5630114873588188
Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr.: 2.339467889756827
Jones's shop boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr.: 2.2130657744735296
Collins by Jane's introduction of him.: 2.157410737085555
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr.: 2.0306226595193126
Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the ----shire.: 3.345152237920534
She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.: 2.74344715308383
Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid, disagreeable fellows." Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.: 2.01436433346309
Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening.: 2.2026735587698663
This was agreed to, and Mrs.: 1.5181826239496925
Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.: 1.8118013065888265
As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.: 2.1799816309846114
Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs.: 1.4625618116074905
Bennet by admiring Mrs.: 1.1154647584009443
Philips's manners and politeness.: 2.6290493627016374
He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before.: 2.3111238876482303
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.: 2.255388247945635
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr.: 2.188428992271068
Collins's scruples of leaving Mr.: 2.1764418423059015
Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr.: 2.0326763485329042
Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house.: 2.516247454844417
When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.: 1.827863612768448
Philips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room.: 2.005218293592469
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.: 2.280873894372063
Philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could.: 2.090570814250572
To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.: 2.122421517499931
It was over at last however.: 1.5392771168890005
The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr.: 2.067060773233777
Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.: 2.203361783809335
Wickham and the officers, Mr.: 2.1198207037504386
Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs.: 1.8344550401307598
When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her in return, by sitting down to whist.: 2.210309204722163
"I know little of the game, at present," said he, "but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" Mrs.: 2.4260849752325666
Philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.: 1.6699471369262504
At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in particular.: 2.1678023984823573
Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr.: 2.615268431774799
Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr.: 2.367791887126669
She dared not even mention that gentleman.: 1.9475779032360732
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved.: 1.3076509127579479
Wickham began the subject himself.: 1.5970508888217738
He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in an hesitating manner how long Mr.: 2.016461061950362
Darcy had been staying there.: 6.737550548247579
"About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand."  "Yes," replied Wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one.: 2.4464122557033816
A clear ten thousand per annum.: 1.8455199919665026
"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday.--Are you much acquainted with Mr.: 1.8726230736488507
I am not qualified to form one.: 2.2920596936884143
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.: 2.235166261695355
It is impossible for _me_ to be impartial.: 1.8090198579573762
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else.--Here you are in your own family."  "Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.: 1.9392593184354405
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire.: 2.3885671131163173
Every body is disgusted with his pride.: 1.6679234498391762
You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one."  "I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen.: 2.422195455460307
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen."  "I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man." Wickham only shook his head.: 1.9920659333595305
"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer."  "I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield.: 2.524122244587713
I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."  "Oh!: 2.2582357224664906
no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr.: 1.9921548960370228
If _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go.: 1.896474319586712
We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.: 2.1819779817509306
His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr.: 2.366048100147001
Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr.: 2.8616496057993897
Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections.: 1.4341499209215107
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father."  Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.: 1.9948689512971383
"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.: 2.4222222053826616
Society, I own, is necessary to me.: 1.7611611215191147
I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude.: 2.6163761817951077
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible.: 1.707098786516434
Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift.: 1.9058882755464588
He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.: 2.9572598261669563
I cannot do justice to his kindness.: 1.660510076873974
He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere."  "Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be?--How could his will be disregarded?--Why did not you seek legal redress?"  "There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law.: 2.2637028952210376
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr.: 2.0647800520112414
Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.: 1.8336124478183453
Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it.: 2.259372778154497
I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely.: 2.536194904276461
I can recal nothing worse.: 2.9876571152711295
"But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"  "A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy.: 1.7970474382643973
Had the late Mr.: 1.1193150216106802
Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life.: 1.861453044998279
Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!"  After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, "I _do_ remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.: 2.4549417522180703
His disposition must be dreadful."  "I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham, "_I_ can hardly be just to him."  Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his father!"--She could have added, "A young man too, like _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented herself with "And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!"  "We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.: 2.075637426388486
_My_ father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr.: 1.5050645004542524
Philips, appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr.: 1.8099602184789245
Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property.: 2.056147297625851
He was most highly esteemed by Mr.: 1.3472088415121342
Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend.: 2.019495803663442
Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance, and when immediately before my father's death, Mr.: 2.18119692976243
Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself."  "How strange!" cried Elizabeth.: 2.2577495403604284
"How abominable!--I wonder that the very pride of this Mr.: 1.562750513027365
Darcy has not made him just to you!--If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty I must call it."  "It _is_ wonderful,"--replied Wickham,--"for almost all his actions may be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend.: 1.9354922192794775
It has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor.: 1.5609265760303221
Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this.: 2.4396285643186455
Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.: 2.292888975114165
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy.: 2.0923409396543566
But she is too much like her brother,--very, very proud.--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.: 2.1076110689459666
How can Mr.: 1.0444095627939656
Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?: 2.2542981242187707
Bingley?"  "Not at all."  "He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man.: 2.5966766499398255
He cannot know what Mr.: 1.6195928011483414
Darcy is."  "Probably not;--but Mr.: 1.3908532211866118
Darcy can please where he chuses.: 1.4566449174046463
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while.: 1.742357365543707
Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.: 2.4874064315845223
Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs.: 1.5621671402253248
Philips.--The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter.: 1.7003701910770923
It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs.: 2.406021671057487
Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy.: 2.203828397591303
"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.: 2.1691876308533087
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters."  Mr.: 2.0645731545091106
Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.: 2.0739152029276138
"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a living.: 2.4730866448219238
I hardly know how Mr.: 2.137540293630344
Darcy."  "No, indeed, I did not.--I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections.: 3.156222192374737
Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined to another.: 2.153345732851899
"Mr.: 1.0319113630282717
Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."  "I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.: 2.512907551161693
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class."  Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.: 1.9847478961620688
Wickham's attentions.: 8.700826843382687
There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs.: 1.740985391676668
Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every body.: 2.3384221262048084
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.: 1.6752335517444987
She could think of nothing but of Mr.: 1.8276756300226198
Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr.: 2.317283321417116
Collins were once silent.: 1.247884401533778
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won, and Mr.: 1.7531596142229942
Collins, in describing the civility of Mr.: 1.4992837593513388
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr.: 2.203757617785164
Wickham and herself.: 1.541109244480219
Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.: 1.644798002431191
"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea.: 2.5105393178850597
Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other.: 1.6419612228183886
It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side."  "Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody."  "Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.: 2.056550203241174
My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr.: 1.6689633523220473
No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.: 2.036754699171946
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?: 1.4972992535254934
oh!: 2.1281906869844955
no."  "I can much more easily believe Mr.: 2.523521068572096
Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr.: 2.8403082469517673
Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.--If it be not so, let Mr.: 1.9325866939320642
Darcy contradict it.: 3.050209796056753
Besides, there was truth in his looks."  "It is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--One does not know what to think."  "I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think."  But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.: 1.988821357512281
Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.: 2.0700047378294695
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr.: 2.084484618556546
Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday.: 2.0458680522239416
The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation.: 1.8805827964834398
To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs.: 2.0360001829949668
Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.: 2.9862051695533784
They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs.: 1.4789060569429007
Bennet's civilities.: 5.144822606512152
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family.: 2.042082323869055
Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr.: 1.9846112299434324
Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card.: 2.1456698994854957
Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.: 2.400980768495411
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr.: 3.0782405938835953
Darcy's looks and behaviour.: 3.328744454809263
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia, depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr.: 1.7365317459887573
Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was at any rate, a ball.: 2.5110597339524303
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it.: 2.5753351213011806
"While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough.--I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.: 2.0520060302783296
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body."  Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr.: 2.2629148293447923
Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr.: 2.318860613848809
Bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.: 2.8352255152929096
"I am by no means of opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her."  Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.: 2.227418992377189
Collins instead!: 1.7756990233127645
her liveliness had been never worse timed.: 1.3691651483596252
Wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer, and Mr.: 2.299113377693565
Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.: 2.8873791666491386
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--It now first struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.: 2.0162130930740934
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_.: 1.9775595068947518
Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply.: 1.7985011066496714
Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.: 1.9359858249005197
No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy.: 1.6912627468177386
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr.: 1.5395231581329782
Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia.: 2.280397821454261
CHAPTER XVIII.: 1.0767509623679594
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr.: 1.7449066879325223
Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.: 2.1774484793885205
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her.: 1.8621189290599982
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr.: 1.5886228031874352
Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr.: 2.2424637295478758
Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,  "I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."  This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.: 2.1192229074488216
Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.: 1.5135481855511346
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.: 2.42885212420366
Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.: 1.7070619539907337
The moment of her release from him was ecstacy.: 1.472188826393082
She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.: 2.4022794971385766
Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him.: 2.2707646981784326
He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her.: 2.3088912580971637
"I dare say you will find him very agreeable."  "Heaven forbid!--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me such an evil."  When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.: 2.01725780943994
Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr.: 1.909297577296717
Darcy, and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.: 1.5893208476416125
He replied, and was again silent.: 3.903338967245725
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with  "It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr.: 2.0037035540042205
"Very well.--That reply will do for the present.--Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.--But _now_ we may be silent."  "Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"  "Sometimes.: 1.6808499821872702
One must speak a little, you know.: 2.679819510216516
It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible."  "Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?"  "Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds.--We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."  "This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure," said he.: 2.2720700139103975
"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.--_You_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."  "I must not decide on my own performance."  He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton.: 2.1372066728727694
She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance."  The effect was immediate.: 1.9359711392828847
At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said,  "Mr.: 2.5652436075213014
Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is less certain."  "He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied Elizabeth with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life."  Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.: 2.162962043300074
Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.: 2.0995456141151876
"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir.: 3.2789262738605065
Such very superior dancing is not often seen.: 1.5329519287769797
It is evident that you belong to the first circles.: 1.9052454299768877
Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place.: 2.271988355662102
What congratulations will then flow in!: 1.3625871227242177
I appeal to Mr.: 1.3963147628436978
Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said,  "Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."  "I do not think we were speaking at all.: 2.2795421294339304
Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.--We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine."  "What think you of books?" said he, smiling.: 2.125454777877432
"Books--Oh!: 1.4247783316832188
no.--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings."  "I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions."  "No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else."  "The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?" said he, with a look of doubt.: 2.1777674407752565
"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr.: 2.324397760430336
Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable.: 2.6323556133944703
You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being created_."  "I am," said he, with a firm voice.: 3.6895152745506996
"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"  "I hope not."  "It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first."  "May I ask to what these questions tend?"  "Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity.: 2.0596630203809303
"I am trying to make it out."  "And what is your success?"  She shook her head.: 3.183031576843091
"I do not get on at all.: 2.3825706835388107
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.: 2.044481148033645
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,  "So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!--Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.: 2.123492400094682
Darcy's steward.: 6.322440827980794
Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr.: 2.0307231475546947
Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr.: 2.456686058799152
Darcy in a most infamous manner.: 1.5252972174958042
I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr.: 3.279257250393593
Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.: 2.459310179365299
I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better."  "His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr.: 1.935284980553151
Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself."  "I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.: 2.742614393247832
"Excuse my interference.--It was kindly meant."  "Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself.--"You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.: 1.6448204463043374
I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.: 1.4226471996055603
Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley.: 2.451434544091168
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.: 2.3926203336304113
"I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr.: 2.7079830763659305
Wickham.: 6.2836587095573595
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon."  "No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you.: 2.6350979280473807
Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr.: 2.122382873288122
Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr.: 2.4787600625195627
Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr.: 1.315877245648276
Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's, Mr.: 2.8783521786957014
Wickham is by no means a respectable young man.: 1.9861833911302038
I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr.: 2.2291919534999787
Darcy's regard."  "Mr.: 3.2556508351846167
But what does he say of the living?"  "He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr.: 1.9182203988408608
Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only."  "I have not a doubt of Mr.: 2.9948795955373186
Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly; "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.: 2.450969000767169
Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before."  She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment.: 2.1285404612983885
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it.: 2.1942536355317994
On their being joined by Mr.: 1.5981688950393977
Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr.: 1.7018950931062324
Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.: 2.3378759346814304
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine.: 2.146856400011929
How wonderfully these sort of things occur!: 1.5737095846960345
Who would have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly!--I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.: 1.7831470003229903
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."  "You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr.: 1.8508684502609312
Darcy?"  "Indeed I am.: 3.0287020150375503
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.: 1.4699645732048343
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_.: 3.154639029165882
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night."  Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that Mr.: 2.089569598977683
Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance.--Mr.: 1.7040778725347951
Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus,  "My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained.: 2.1044212580820774
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself." And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.: 1.7551474339818645
Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.: 1.9810814220687247
Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology," "Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh."--It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man.: 2.3762058271654922
Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr.: 2.3270018797205663
Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.: 1.935397562223835
Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr.: 2.7210691593118397
Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.: 2.0556404264380665
Collins then returned to Elizabeth.: 3.9450905261876867
"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my reception.: 2.9058021675280097
Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.: 2.156432730907052
He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.: 2.2923439660244185
It was really a very handsome thought.: 2.374033082794815
Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."  As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr.: 2.210322165406091
Bingley, and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane.: 2.2623724907110323
She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters.: 1.9002887105163495
Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much.: 1.9588864591868929
When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr.: 1.9000231535033816
His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do.: 2.5319102045947206
It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.: 2.3632462109695473
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.: 1.945189682200799
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.: 1.7393241772049197
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr.: 2.0427389829465676
Darcy, who sat opposite to them.: 2.5246876107733724
Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.: 2.6744534147908134
"What is Mr.: 5.4075741345678505
Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?: 3.293931322349105
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear."  "For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.--What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr.: 1.904554134609583
Darcy?--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing."  Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.: 2.195284784406826
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.: 1.9163848988848025
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.: 1.365386655760059
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr.: 2.1024429412492562
Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.: 2.3701302653652405
At length however Mrs.: 1.1726862175417467
Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.: 2.242723768125688
Elizabeth now began to revive.: 1.9257537254010102
But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company.: 1.9883767386852924
By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.: 1.9399283924963482
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.: 1.9080716064888577
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected.--Elizabeth was in agonies.: 1.9285683026896738
She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley.: 2.5037698097592394
She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however impenetrably grave.: 2.34643558798263
She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night.: 1.854392088627214
He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,  "That will do extremely well, child.: 2.1115762916427796
You have delighted us long enough.: 1.4115753155278856
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."  Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to.: 2.149956172596968
"If I," said Mr.: 3.075864890416182
Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.: 2.0093469426673845
The rector of a parish has much to do.--In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron.: 2.093176106251379
He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible.: 2.099090696038328
And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.: 2.1225676662383606
I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family." And with a bow to Mr.: 1.9773210694367862
Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--Many stared.--Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.: 1.7913697698130637
Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr.: 1.469110263046419
Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.: 2.377213371270763
To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.: 2.0519594015045826
That his two sisters and Mr.: 1.7753708437294105
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement.: 2.2320549345088274
She was teazed by Mr.: 3.1399519513376406
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.: 1.8981674193292952
He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening.: 2.3855094113852755
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr.: 2.1554732824252096
Collins's conversation to herself.: 2.7098839123046763
Darcy's farther notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.: 1.9848915029735412
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr.: 2.7415333466201695
Wickham, and rejoiced in it.: 3.047147771953687
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manoeuvre of Mrs.: 2.295909193067769
They repulsed every attempt of Mrs.: 1.4088207057580877
Collins, who was complimenting Mr.: 3.3497265001531016
Darcy said nothing at all.: 1.9093284008319937
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs.: 1.317124184646795
Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord, how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn.: 1.761853851257416
Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr.: 1.7365870016937517
Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation.: 1.970876871370492
Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.: 2.1660925913578946
Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four months.: 1.9602993264648516
Of having another daughter married to Mr.: 1.511960278883966
Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.: 2.35416526781153
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr.: 2.016851685193797
Bingley and Netherfield.: 1.4814238482571958
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.: 1.9184886167336823
Collins made his declaration in form.: 1.309573511826544
Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.: 2.1513704710074406
On finding Mrs.: 1.0521499623212256
Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,  "May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?"  Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs.: 2.364356943872721
Collins must excuse me.--He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear.: 2.1613585709941385
I am going away myself."  "No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.--I desire you will stay where you are."--And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added, "Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.: 1.955551803831131
Collins."  Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion.: 1.9867947843832339
Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone Mr.: 2.7503861003178107
Collins began.: 1.7301438486359413
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother's permission for this address.: 2.0769906476514746
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.: 1.61266294840118
Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life.: 1.9178804320393503
Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued:  "My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish.: 1.834918743677808
Secondly, that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.: 2.2220886288322785
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs.: 1.835699731579157
Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr.: 2.785482930143738
Collins, you must marry.: 3.566152782502637
A clergyman like you must marry.--Chuse properly, chuse a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way.: 1.6882961446681237
Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer.: 2.34071549876101
You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.: 1.7463455195332998
Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I assure you there are many amiable young women.: 1.7268616846100664
But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years.: 2.219550176887852
This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.: 2.3219927710682153
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection.: 1.8047411689689967
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents.: 1.9453292416530124
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.: 2.086150526866329
On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."  It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.: 2.1033367543500536
"You are too hasty, Sir," she cried.: 3.6254079413392652
"You forget that I have made no answer.: 2.61019469669893
Let me do it without farther loss of time.: 1.717344820400651
Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me.: 1.602950710440885
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."  "Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration.: 2.1449789495258815
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time.: 1.8144751630133444
Collins very gravely--"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you.: 2.0461590234664797
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualifications."  "Indeed, Mr.: 2.053917847614588
Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.: 1.53731955823035
I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.: 2.0350049872657556
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.: 2.0624034484813074
Collins thus addressed her,  "When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character."  "Really, Mr.: 1.9534480013749973
Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me exceedingly.: 2.5579908862645655
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one."  "You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.: 2.1384781192760562
My reasons for believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable.: 1.7139124347327306
My situation in life, my connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.: 2.048295614194231
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.: 1.9953879604371838
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."  "I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.: 2.27514885292466
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.: 1.6213229931534023
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.: 2.1146853975402
My feelings in every respect forbid it.: 1.8439845072072456
Can I speak plainer?: 2.0860545549057767
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart."  "You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable."  To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.: 1.8563799824535596
CHAPTER XX.: 1.3179356363614787
Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.: 1.7977701589471695
Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.: 1.8801051005946672
This information, however, startled Mrs.: 2.663320029719048
Bennet;--she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so.: 2.5579093409513542
"But depend upon it, Mr.: 1.6510684456777722
Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall be brought to reason.: 2.2978240680729973
I will speak to her about it myself directly.: 1.6652232660521995
She is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will _make_ her know it."  "Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam," cried Mr.: 2.3134039341221144
If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."  "Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs.: 1.7937949985495099
Bennet, alarmed.: 27.8552917131961
"Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.: 1.6525551672756795
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived.: 1.9068167146292123
I will go directly to Mr.: 1.7423110222276486
Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.: 2.419482159569432
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr.: 1.3991320186141125
Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_."  Mr.: 2.4153905190977367
Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication.: 2.0056662596361345
"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had finished her speech.: 3.497117836571806
"Of what are you talking?"  "Of Mr.: 2.211354762646166
Collins and Lizzy.: 1.5138717480026127
Lizzy declares she will not have Mr.: 2.035126699686702
Collins, and Mr.: 2.9921188317627077
Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy."  "And what am I to do on the occasion?--It seems an hopeless business."  "Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.: 2.218929355785352
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him."  "Let her be called down.: 1.9629246542164185
She shall hear my opinion."  Mrs.: 1.3639328280861083
Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.: 2.848773795637398
"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared.: 2.5849853129029303
"I have sent for you on an affair of importance.: 2.1236287124714046
I understand that Mr.: 1.323223334372341
Collins has made you an offer of marriage.: 1.9025656142542886
Is it true?" Elizabeth replied that it was.: 2.2098131433177377
"Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?"  "I have, Sir."  "Very well.: 2.6970756416248407
We now come to the point.: 2.468832099654579
Your mother insists upon your accepting it.: 1.47996400878912
Is not it so, Mrs.: 1.9134182415401506
Bennet?"  "Yes, or I will never see her again."  "An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.: 2.246541764587301
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents.--Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr.: 2.166688796890069
Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_."  Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but Mrs.: 2.538975746401347
"What do you mean, Mr.: 2.032454797607486
Bennet, by talking in this way?: 1.9779381692597977
You promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him."  "My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to request.: 2.511752242925458
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room.: 1.9909948686672467
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be."  Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs.: 2.6799833039253005
Bennet give up the point.: 2.178630353360096
She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.: 2.6633817447621495
Though her manner varied however, her determination never did.: 1.4175923345164823
Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.: 1.6997881141414433
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way.: 1.8155161363385135
His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.: 2.07807580170948
While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them.: 1.8001938162274902
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr.: 2.1661167375841335
Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him."  Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs.: 2.3033362898980325
Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family.: 2.3411551196624973
"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves."  Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.: 2.2564046975938346
"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs.: 1.8171172602014598
Bennet, "looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way.--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead.--_I_ shall not be able to keep you--and so I warn you.--I have done with you from this very day.--I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word.: 2.2424545828669538
I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children.--Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body.: 2.286752617087953
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking.: 1.7852694459001635
Nobody can tell what I suffer!--But it is always so.: 2.1164019187616185
Those who do not complain are never pitied."  Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.: 1.5955181689270963
She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr.: 2.3000622157976505
Collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,  "Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let Mr.: 2.602746717034686
Collins and me have a little conversation together."  Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr.: 1.7867233763096004
Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear.: 1.9121029322388854
In a doleful voice Mrs.: 2.749476056960138
Bennet thus began the projected conversation.--"Oh!: 1.4396961488333195
Collins!"--  "My dear Madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point.: 2.477568483943787
Far be it from me," he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter.: 1.8397775860085488
Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned.: 2.291007600150415
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.: 1.6646938722545181
Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.: 1.8341205426128557
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own.: 1.6589069705829589
But we are all liable to error.: 1.7598895145211941
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.: 1.819438444707622
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."     CHAPTER XXI.: 2.055277731245505
The discussion of Mr.: 1.6974313798842204
As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence.: 1.6103790107523044
He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.: 2.9476831479839523
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs.: 1.6945296750106933
Bennet's ill humour or ill health.: 2.277667077567788
Collins was also in the same state of angry pride.: 1.8705404779087809
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.: 2.0519994659938185
He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.: 2.157928614335758
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr.: 1.731936178825315
Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.: 1.9126546643720088
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked over.--To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed.: 2.3260036679841942
"I found," said he, "as the time drew near, that I had better not meet Mr.: 2.3365772527499455
Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself."  She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her.: 2.1247857764479265
His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.: 2.0613841703009097
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and was opened immediately.: 2.0549382939777114
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.: 1.9834035533022272
When they had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,  "This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a good deal.: 2.352788804041346
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.: 2.263198243149984
You shall hear what she says."  She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr.: 1.8030590199589438
Hurst had a house.: 1.762662323984487
The next was in these words.: 2.942104364133491
"I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence.: 1.8194365167908493
Bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.: 3.0164230707843127
"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country.: 2.833586930057239
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?--Mr.: 1.6778567529343174
Bingley will not be detained in London by them."  "Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter.: 1.9955360013548866
I will read it to you--  "When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.: 2.082881398017405
Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I despair.: 2.5774450260930126
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of whom we shall deprive you."  "It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this winter."  "It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_."  "Why will you think so?: 2.2447160115472693
It must be his own doing.--He is his own master.: 2.0991724849233955
But you do not know _all_.: 3.495616665136853
I _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me.: 1.758303542055436
Darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again.: 2.1240312981680662
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable.: 2.638722866355648
My brother admires her greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart.: 2.1732595032219346
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?"  "What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?"--said Jane as she finished it.: 2.0751620788032463
"Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard?: 2.135614404238028
Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"  "Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--Will you hear it?"  "Most willingly."  "You shall have it in few words.: 2.0179670501565816
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you."  Jane shook her head.: 2.322591026421958
"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.--No one who has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection.: 2.0851812084265178
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot.: 3.1188697945210797
She is not such a simpleton.: 2.962526122837148
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.: 1.5985903477431522
Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.: 2.476278893984634
But the case is this.: 1.6806572941209197
We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.: 2.436115870637179
But I know the foundation is unjust.: 1.766164453348256
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself."  "That is right.--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine.: 2.284977530331435
A thousand things may arise in six months!"  The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt.: 1.6846299003067686
It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of every one.: 2.1266082373352893
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.: 2.3485238637419363
Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.: 2.4177782597626765
They agreed that Mrs.: 1.2694772248546202
Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.: 2.207628985004362
CHAPTER XXII.: 1.3179356363614787
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr.: 2.205210676072767
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.: 3.2445571913524285
"It keeps him in good humour," said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express." Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.: 2.1039370708400114
This was very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her from any return of Mr.: 1.7760509625203398
Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself.: 1.872523537564633
Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.: 2.175590638065887
But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet.: 2.160671119782587
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.: 1.918782773942402
His reception however was of the most flattering kind.: 1.8528351070021678
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.: 2.032238606795655
The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.: 1.8495626515096204
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.: 1.920942352144347
Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair.: 1.9567824819744268
Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr.: 1.6021376632060247
Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St.: 2.0622479094942925
The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion.: 2.1946162492653416
The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid.: 1.937103314331962
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed.: 1.2403944545934293
She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it.: 2.066467031901962
Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary.: 1.9283174261135076
The least agreeable circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person.: 1.886864577174175
Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation.: 2.1387528773349325
She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr.: 2.3827101632864025
Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.: 2.1918993734644117
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs.: 1.9563831876872644
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.: 1.942737187522106
"My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible."  They were all astonished; and Mr.: 2.6655473805956076
Collins, "I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."  "You cannot be too much on your guard.: 2.3517052784022106
Risk any thing rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence."  "Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.: 2.0818776339377814
As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth."  With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.: 1.918443049820192
Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.: 2.2665253045886695
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very agreeable companion.: 2.1515563201807697
But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away.: 1.9989966144723357
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.: 2.1927131969947924
The possibility of Mr.: 2.8319753762338653
my dear Charlotte,--impossible!"  The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied,  "Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible that Mr.: 2.0448373346143116
Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"  But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.: 2.4843589510823594
"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte,--"you must be surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr.: 1.9713298636184464
Collins was wishing to marry you.: 1.4697395635227257
But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done.: 2.9319363885320664
I am not romantic you know.: 4.259539437655309
I never was.: 1.2785314360197513
I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr.: 1.624466028341442
Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.: 2.3166757904723183
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match.: 2.056845840009666
The strangeness of Mr.: 5.338777364655422
Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted.: 2.048980032541042
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.: 2.43459609706534
Charlotte the wife of Mr.: 1.2593824254121109
Collins, was a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.: 2.102126505935705
CHAPTER XXIII.: 1.3179356363614787
Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,  "Good Lord!: 1.91831024291081
Sir William, how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know that Mr.: 2.174848500862766
Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr.: 2.020907729426756
Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.: 2.4580528151178322
In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr.: 2.696438759361736
Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.: 2.5195865636547867
Nothing could console and nothing appease her.--Nor did that day wear out her resentment.: 1.5888207038239648
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.: 1.8033176821959072
Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!: 2.455847006800346
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.: 1.8967342967388672
Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr.: 2.4366623253132884
Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.: 1.7732782587656253
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs.: 2.0853110849592174
Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs.: 2.0337719457040366
Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.: 2.290665294780822
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again.: 2.0327434886674296
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.: 1.976505001737299
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.: 1.9685016630875076
Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted.: 1.8989649964356126
After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.: 2.0477657533132274
Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs.: 2.4354298550974938
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband.--It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.--She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable.: 1.9641829685013048
Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs.: 1.5907644861873116
Bingley's continued absence.: 3.6042382817159155
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.: 1.766756230900778
Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.: 1.6942954481635126
Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.: 1.7915817511951324
Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring.: 2.9093342331410668
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.: 2.2781487907951354
As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to.: 2.1981912670224726
It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.: 1.6626220299233425
Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction.: 1.9486405631379895
He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company.: 2.054315214017128
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.: 1.9992195571990148
The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her.: 1.901651419674638
As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence.: 2.2374872921496247
Whenever Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr.: 1.9788135596922354
Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr.: 2.623798557210537
She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.: 3.012050974748863
"Indeed, Mr.: 2.208901722779207
Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!"  "My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.: 2.49920814072939
Let us hope for better things.: 1.2731937145318106
Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor."  This was not very consoling to Mrs.: 2.4034796780731886
Bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before,  "I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.: 3.0405670882103535
Bennet, for any thing about the entail.: 2.5373129633931515
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr.: 1.8385935709424324
Collins too!--Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?"  "I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr.: 1.829586132131331

II.: 1.3116482481460217
London: Printed for T.: 1.5258306335734864
PRIDE & PREJUDICE.: 1.0819212563917389
Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.: 2.4445591601235286
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.: 1.8861076186959604
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort.: 2.236938446613833
Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it.: 2.670376255773328
Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter.: 1.8375936763411709
Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.: 2.186149570697431
Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation.: 2.2507474816166466
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all the others.: 2.2771315683705766
That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations.: 2.3249201784872366
Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself.: 2.3584503574247657
It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.: 2.2406839016751987
Bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying,  "Oh!: 2.3929087069076167
that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.: 1.7611163238339569
But I will not repine.: 3.6667186103612903
It cannot last long.: 1.2683019018557247
He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before."  Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.: 2.3262337585959423
"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no reason.: 2.0735854720625215
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all.: 2.1855944385645176
I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.: 1.9770336947879188
Thank God!: 1.6226685584953089
A little time therefore.--I shall certainly try to get the better."  With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to any one but myself."  "My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good.: 2.4362145388231
Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you.: 2.54935301664772
I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve."  Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection.: 1.9277361381731506
"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair.: 3.7110320990173107
_You_ wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body.: 1.9460844935979562
_I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.: 1.671254584939066
Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will.: 1.8648695455897546
You need not.: 6.451993637070791
There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well.: 2.0801885400150977
The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense.: 2.021678700180057
I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's marriage.: 1.977407460766562
It is unaccountable!: 5.93481052978676
They will ruin your happiness.: 1.2561378612127152
Consider Mr.: 1.092946854771403
Collins's respectability, and Charlotte's prudent, steady character.: 2.1497674664290223
Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin."  "To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding, than I now do of her heart.: 2.124982279278507
My dear Jane, Mr.: 2.132359045910574
Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him, cannot have a proper way of thinking.: 2.3272815933649373
You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger, security for happiness."  "I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied Jane, "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together.: 2.104849014182494
You alluded to something else.: 1.469729636886672
You mentioned _two_ instances.: 1.225980177145885
I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk.: 2.0682848894404233
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured.: 2.3134578615534807
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect.: 2.1174988988378525
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us.: 1.8711900500906302
Women fancy admiration means more than it does."  "And men take care that they should."  "If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."  "I am far from attributing any part of Mr.: 2.2987752985358556
Bingley's conduct to design," said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.: 2.3821431921861356
Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business."  "And do you impute it to either of those?"  "Yes; to the last.: 2.345767501785215
But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem.: 2.0655523830997593
Stop me whilst you can."  "You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him."  "Yes, in conjunction with his friend."  "I cannot believe it.: 2.7174339950722124
Why should they try to influence him?: 1.6296868688472996
They can only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it."  "Your first position is false.: 2.43272858374786
They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride."  "Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy," replied Jane; "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.: 1.830499270444415
But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's.: 2.185512634811427
If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.: 2.1727396150573544
By supposing such an affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy.: 1.5865510604002413
Do not distress me by the idea.: 1.7129833229911313
Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."  Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr.: 2.256872113234668
Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.: 2.43823399711829
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity.: 1.8562290197722295
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.: 2.071871905071607
Bennet's best comfort was, that Mr.: 2.24573988645756
Bingley must be down again in the summer.: 1.884670358444155
Bennet treated the matter differently.: 3.67263967321431
"So, Lizzy," said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love I find.: 2.7974143225781996
I congratulate her.: 1.272558011325024
Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.: 1.7439844871991759
It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions.: 1.986501749617225
You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane.: 1.9149183506138352
Now is your time.: 1.734952325378424
Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.: 1.7720284638604458
Let Wickham be _your_ man.: 1.3470783792959962
We must not all expect Jane's good fortune."  "True," said Mr.: 2.5164963660621886
Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it."  Mr.: 2.5208449908273463
Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family.: 2.1200901819630635
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr.: 1.955048936923763
Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr.: 2.782992419447072
Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter.: 2.1416727945175253
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else Mr.: 1.9473867304220445
Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.: 1.550734703042714
CHAPTER II.: 1.063151314611428
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.: 1.4479151452098327
Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday.: 1.7144275293223985
The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.: 2.1516502610060817
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.: 1.8185655761782142
Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn.: 2.234828361398279
Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.: 2.2005510132655486
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred and agreeable.: 2.0729564638093967
Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs.: 2.1995946529489085
Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.: 1.9629969234341498
Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.: 1.8501798208940803
They had frequently been staying with her in town.: 1.6888359519801783
The first part of Mrs.: 1.2936122494140885
Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.: 1.8246480001586556
When this was done, she had a less active part to play.: 2.2204422202855563
It became her turn to listen.: 1.5484495101658493
Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.: 1.6205106528311364
They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.: 2.034020989390853
"I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got Mr.: 2.638401867187347
Bingley, if she could.: 4.242585733768716
But, Lizzy!: 4.0435616168807655
it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr.: 2.9709729419276485
Collins's wife by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness.: 2.586770986747079
He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him.: 2.3909890737884627
The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever.: 2.3162868694893954
They are all for what they can get.: 1.8770002558099823
I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.: 2.6738617704364525
It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else.: 2.3176089004730667
However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves."  Mrs.: 2.204537999585079
"It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," said she.: 3.461337900278599
"I am sorry it went off.: 3.087520604304361
But these things happen so often!: 1.4369616826701959
A young man, such as you describe Mr.: 2.8171700906408548
Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent."  "An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not do for _us_.: 2.408040350272259
We do not suffer by _accident_.: 1.9519098209207992
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love with only a few days before."  "But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.: 2.2962690619510253
It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.: 1.7868419645135367
Bingley's love?"  "I never saw a more promising inclination.: 3.2013149580779396
He was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.: 1.6850540493370345
Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable.: 2.410084120869415
At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.: 1.9896710129349753
Could there be finer symptoms?: 1.7865186107238584
Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"  "Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.: 2.0415562083815924
I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately.: 2.3832250439895657
It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.: 1.9816375704106755
But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us?: 2.4209674546943387
Change of scene might be of service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as anything."  Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.: 2.0100128122551113
"I hope," added Mrs.: 3.50911716457586
Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her.: 2.2956311007615864
We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her."  "And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr.: 2.368780964083061
Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London!: 2.0806555065153627
My dear aunt, how could you think of it?: 2.4777125353501024
Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr.: 2.2000943970221964
Bingley never stirs without him."  "So much the better.: 1.9276574747955126
I hope they will not meet at all.: 2.0604963294522096
_She_ will not be able to help calling."  "She will drop the acquaintance entirely."  But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless.: 2.215395248522969
It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions.: 2.2540882290474187
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.: 2.221800631072969
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement.: 2.5018341967251905
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner.: 2.2411384892054946
When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers Mr.: 2.356128396521637
Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs.: 1.987358182997786
Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.: 2.1020516569398566
Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.: 2.284578477938492
To Mrs.: 1.103293718637856
Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers.: 1.471108048938429
About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire, to which he belonged.: 2.114436613441837
Darcy by character perfectly well.: 1.3717592952647761
Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse.: 1.5009070640484856
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley, with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself.: 2.040302202387485
Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard Mr.: 2.5962887403713113
CHAPTER III.: 1.063151314611428
Do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.: 1.7264713163089394
I have nothing to say against _him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better.: 2.832830999275553
You have sense, and we all expect you to use it.: 1.9919475144860612
You must not disappoint your father."  "My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."  "Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."  "Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.: 2.266085360197045
I will take care of myself, and of Mr.: 2.8802807040635297
Wickham too.: 3.067350307911259
He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it."  "Elizabeth, you are not serious now."  "I beg your pardon.: 3.1525125927540967
At present I am not in love with Mr.: 3.317544369897215
Wickham; no, I certainly am not.: 2.1488394473958587
But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to me--I believe it will be better that he should not.: 2.2431122500703573
I see the imprudence of it.--Oh!: 1.9815673887891068
_that_ abominable Mr.: 1.0444095627939656
Darcy!--My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it.: 2.4655127710972846
My father, however, is partial to Mr.: 2.820577737752511
Wickham.: 6.2836587095573595
In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist?: 2.190419616460593
All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry.: 3.385473378433804
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object.: 2.5488160032634917
When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.: 4.017172759437081
At least, you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him."  "As I did the other day," said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_.: 2.3841718930431397
But do not imagine that he is always here so often.: 2.433372199078413
You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends.: 2.287845227955088
But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you are satisfied."  Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented.: 2.1508020574703934
Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.: 1.834830617497247
His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she "_wished_ they might be happy." Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room.: 2.0803493608428125
As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,  "I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza."  "_That_ you certainly shall."  "And I have another favour to ask.: 2.2974156714545066
Will you come and see me?"  "We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."  "I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.: 2.3589041647705837
Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford."  Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.: 2.81208868642322
"My father and Maria are to come to me in March," added Charlotte, "and I hope you will consent to be of the party.: 2.6628075622803227
Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either of them."  The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual.: 2.152672481682052
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible.: 1.9400557792311377
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was.: 2.3871330239629778
Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.: 2.119229266916307
She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise.: 1.8958041921365403
It was Mr.: 1.0444095627939656
Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there, to know the rest.: 2.1184668800314395
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is.: 1.4268324180647318
Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or hearing from Caroline.: 2.050744095630518
She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been lost.: 2.443731264473166
"I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London.: 2.8178283663227486
I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.: 1.4863779389059018
I enquired after their brother, of course.: 2.035419706454347
He was well, but so much engaged with Mr.: 2.2824565003525215
Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him.: 2.652488905214694
I wish I could see her.: 2.5361705384941042
My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs.: 1.6972040480149873
Hurst were going out.: 1.3899902089093255
I dare say I shall soon see them here."  Elizabeth shook her head over this letter.: 1.9680703947465759
It convinced her, that accident only could discover to Mr.: 1.684119103306469
Bingley her sister's being in town.: 2.9373736851352032
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.: 2.1311491880015256
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention.: 2.7681229843057658
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will prove what she felt.: 2.5546193022026276
"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in      her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have      been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me.: 2.4050255094038575
But, my      dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me      obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour      was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.: 1.9522688330242508
I do not at      all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but      if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should      be deceived again.: 2.215466516358968
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;      and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time.: 1.674175491359117
When      she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;      she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said      not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so      altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly      resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.: 2.315100557164421
I pity, though I      cannot help blaming her.: 2.0185280717004153
She was very wrong in singling me out as      she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on      her side.: 1.9816593057665388
But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been      acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her      brother is the cause of it.: 2.0770729409445225
I need not explain myself farther; and      though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she      feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so      deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may      feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable.: 1.9324722011383377
He knows of my      being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and      yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to      persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy.: 2.3948949996553965
I cannot      understand it.: 1.7570355285342196
If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should      be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of      duplicity in all this.: 2.9958139039129055
But I will endeavour to banish every painful      thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,      and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.: 2.245259033041189
Let me hear      from you very soon.: 1.827095562449547
Miss Bingley said something of his never      returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not      with any certainty.: 2.0761885609771493
Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria.: 2.3283883076289937
I am      sure you will be very comfortable there.: 5.930767974157555
"Your's, &c."  This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.: 2.2240840823376318
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.: 1.4982448314068648
His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.: 2.246439893185279
Darcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.: 2.5634482817428514
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself.: 1.7880402857157633
His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.: 2.3298467940640353
Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.: 2.2969677946819815
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.: 1.9922095333504088
The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.: 2.278491017024631
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.: 2.0820708958597476
All this was acknowledged to Mrs.: 1.8661065405384962
But my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King.: 1.5843250622714176
I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl.: 2.55793960288764
There can be no love in all this.: 2.2837896332184706
My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.: 2.4710075323297023
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.: 1.292246103011251
Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.: 2.025605265494235
They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the plain."     CHAPTER IV.: 1.976200229855654
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford.: 1.6269071136691238
There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake.: 2.2859666757261836
The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay.: 2.5155177033684093
Every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch.: 3.029491069133
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.: 2.3426788279384487
The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.: 2.0106196113781674
The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.: 2.452432447125792
The farewell between herself and Mr.: 1.5191084728725677
Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more.: 1.7714830635160554
Her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable.: 2.11200773811745
Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise.: 2.215527935179606
Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William's too long.: 2.698448991572507
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out like his information.: 1.5855694897267403
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon.: 2.227299693899124
On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.: 2.104407516704419
The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.: 2.8782027012670537
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.: 1.6946881653705104
Their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection.: 2.0578058896093636
It was reasonable, however, to hope, that they would not continue long.: 3.0856048953921063
Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.: 1.9739205063549647
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.: 2.4962350476604946
"But, my dear Elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is Miss King?: 2.6482534934907567
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."  "Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?: 2.044894526859296
Where does discretion end, and avarice begin?: 2.2709071320026184
Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary."  "If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think."  "She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.: 2.508099389105984
I know no harm of her."  "But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune."  "No--why should he?: 2.181483763696052
If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?"  "But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this event."  "A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe.: 2.0367472280510057
If _she_ does not object to it, why should _we_?"  "_Her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_.: 1.6680757064199931
It only shews her being deficient in something herself--sense or feeling."  "Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose.: 1.884085535364535
I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire."  "Oh!: 2.6907191652345945
if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better.: 2.1263708231710376
I am sick of them all.: 2.034604508931473
Thank Heaven!: 1.3554229510537894
I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him.: 1.8444520075559003
Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all."  "Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."  Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.: 1.8338047415283536
"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs.: 1.9526856757497082
Gardiner, "but perhaps to the Lakes."  No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.: 2.861737149146134
"My dear, dear aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight!: 2.6725842936025375
You give me fresh life and vigour.: 1.649060480357386
Adieu to disappointment and spleen.: 1.430515112589642
what hours of transport we shall spend!: 1.8169082575835394
Lakes, mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation.: 2.1316934487553088
Let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."     CHAPTER V.: 1.466732732691267
Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.: 2.1724293251924687
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side.: 1.6044853732857498
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.: 2.692941148316992
At length the Parsonage was discernible.: 1.7712243563292276
The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every thing declared they were arriving.: 2.652896642800056
Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party.: 2.23934032139081
In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.: 2.5917830830552484
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received.: 2.099710589741273
They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.: 1.9339246290587568
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.: 2.560064648899551
But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion.: 2.112806109935452
Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte.: 1.9658583909067038
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear.: 1.6590681622418366
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London, Mr.: 2.863214862614012
Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.: 2.7007310171691636
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.: 2.0736754108081827
Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind.: 1.5537987591587683
But of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.: 1.9022512228918478
It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.: 1.854180351951243
From his garden, Mr.: 1.6146326392480521
Collins would have led them round his two meadows, but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help.: 1.9976907788362064
It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.: 1.605637649373451
Collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.: 2.153189013819173
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.: 1.8896005148219521
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr.: 1.8403635172461574
She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over.: 2.0470497503661162
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.: 1.5683016986792553
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming.: 2.084984883905485
We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home.: 1.8003634698817927
Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.: 2.008147747598862
I _should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."  "Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."  "Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.: 2.3271503181165505
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."  The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well.: 1.9693386036805323
She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr.: 1.5814128774377076
Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings.: 2.382413287812531
A lively imagination soon settled it all.: 1.4329357248829682
About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.: 1.9208096696632087
She opened the door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out,  "Oh, my dear Eliza!: 2.5219559013207946
pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen!: 2.30198935578804
Make haste, and come down this moment."  Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.: 2.080567853667666
"I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter!"  "La!: 2.128188035705137
my dear," said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady Catherine.: 2.248546018943655
The old lady is Mrs.: 1.2756091050337643
Jenkinson, who lives with them.: 1.697787870940021
The other is Miss De Bourgh.: 2.4357322893250513
Only look at her.: 2.0536340106281665
She is quite a little creature.: 1.8300303264667925
Why does she not come in?"  "Oh!: 1.7815446981040244
Charlotte says, she hardly ever does.: 1.5204636742965225
It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in."  "I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.: 2.5632331242022226
"She looks sickly and cross.--Yes, she will do for him very well.: 1.7743554756563125
She will make him a very proper wife."  Mr.: 1.660739563506986
At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house.: 2.5783362215193275
Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.: 2.002355259974918
CHAPTER VI.: 1.0767509623679594
Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete.: 2.476719244126809
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.: 2.1384604394727558
"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings.: 2.3516616042980836
I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen.: 2.137298044600289
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?: 1.953916508901825
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!"  "I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William, "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.: 1.9010811438105704
About the Court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."  Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but their visit to Rosings.: 1.8151756830708785
Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.: 2.09535458510094
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,  "Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.: 2.4496796618884313
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which becomes herself and daughter.: 1.4905948165366576
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion for any thing more.: 2.1277264197229218
She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved."  While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas, who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had done to his presentation at St.: 2.150224829773596
As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park.--Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr.: 2.0366214070862836
Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh.: 2.333525531610464
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she thought she could witness without trepidation.: 2.010479128420024
From the entrance hall, of which Mr.: 2.0109846656562174
Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs.: 1.9344620275221849
In spite of having been at St.: 2.440159372181127
Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank.: 2.3903191929509586
Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.: 2.2723435898933544
When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr.: 1.747737607650319
Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment, at her being so thin, and so small.: 2.271936952244455
There was neither in figure nor face, any likeness between the ladies.: 1.4678500801656789
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs.: 2.1944547191039354
Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.: 2.193998233646795
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows, to admire the view, Mr.: 2.512143863599667
The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which Mr.: 2.261408791811203
Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater.--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.: 2.2330551077732217
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them.: 1.7001046605155787
The party did not supply much conversation.: 1.4140383753554433
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time.: 2.123644501782906
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she were indisposed.: 1.8255505920970811
Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.: 2.234287215125568
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted.: 2.1630856206941167
She enquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice, as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry.: 2.5462199729865915
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others.: 1.824046876630943
In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs.: 1.326450480577749
Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs.: 2.026862464335181
Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl.: 2.3553584291672824
She asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly.--Lady Catherine then observed,  "Your father's estate is entailed on Mr.: 2.064059109382855
Collins, I think.: 3.7108966556494276
then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.: 1.9513291555085683
Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it some day.--Do your sisters play and sing?"  "One of them does."  "Why did not you all learn?--You ought all to have learned.: 1.6384049423717617
The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as your's.--Do you draw?"  "No, not at all."  "What, none of you?"  "Not one."  "That is very strange.: 2.2682173552613585
But I suppose you had no opportunity.: 2.1996643399730536
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."  "My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London."  "Has your governess left you?"  "We never had any governess."  "No governess!: 1.984695863493753
How was that possible?: 1.5027482596774167
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess!--I never heard of such a thing.: 2.4190074231800605
"Then, who taught you?: 2.910674434637923
who attended to you?: 1.815197892107304
Without a governess you must have been neglected."  "Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn, never wanted the means.: 1.8218514767619893
We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.: 2.119709137044924
Those who chose to be idle, certainly might."  "Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one.: 2.02688235967707
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.: 1.6610116713719643
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way.: 2.4426618606813153
Four nieces of Mrs.: 1.262861954633014
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her.: 2.4409062427404637
'Lady Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"  "Yes, Ma'am, all."  "All!--What, all five out at once?: 2.153859231284919
Very odd!--And you only the second.--The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your younger sisters must be very young?"  "Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.: 1.8133079797855474
Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company.: 1.6063711818774047
But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth, as the first.: 2.0963990880818932
And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind."  "Upon my word," said her Ladyship, "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.--Pray, what is your age?"  "With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth smiling, "your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."  Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.: 1.9991729314987148
"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age."  "I am not one and twenty."  When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed.: 2.3208611724802135
Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr.: 2.8448087418573658
Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs.: 2.6468418890949375
Jenkinson to make up her party.: 1.4935587604732308
Their table was superlatively stupid.: 1.4313453557357272
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs.: 1.542448050213329
Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light.: 1.749614986551519
A great deal more passed at the other table.: 2.2521778654666766
Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.: 1.5422889928873607
Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.: 1.5693844998547326
Sir William did not say much.: 1.7965320044117732
He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.: 2.0050983368301254
Collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.: 1.841108860279998
The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow.: 1.7494710667284212
From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.: 2.222820673025296
Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed.: 3.062910282930748
As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was.: 2.8140846033038285
Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's praise into his own hands.: 2.4616765572981767
CHAPTER VII.: 1.0767509623679594
While Sir William was with them, Mr.: 2.2618863841023527
Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road.: 2.0975241470047195
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.: 1.9938242478610624
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr.: 2.051307261077294
Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.: 1.9196232951141772
Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day.: 1.9379781789318604
Very few days passed in which Mr.: 1.6502528255087492
Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours.: 2.2613551600784985
Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.: 2.3182168953576365
Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.: 2.3589235144559892
Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.: 2.6887598698583726
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first.: 2.3145065080531917
Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses' reach.: 1.7752870264692766
Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.: 2.1084363485159674
In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.: 1.6745274801949754
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important.: 2.1911465329500945
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr.: 1.7414235918227055
Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.: 2.1362535115435852
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr.: 1.8424644409287685
Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence.: 1.9427023175003322
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects.: 1.5984825721627274
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr.: 1.7455661781335732
Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr.: 1.949349267862052
Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him.: 1.4309693909930337
Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,  "I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.: 2.0902198894907755
Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me."  Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.: 1.6149084941992762
Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman.: 1.7893425832382912
Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs.: 2.1350437114524676
Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure.: 1.8439600788908346
Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him, without saying a word.: 2.3175432309470523
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs.: 1.766510201722178
Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.: 1.8141210046860192
At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family.: 1.9890376469231537
She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added,  "My eldest sister has been in town these three months.: 2.5155647532670047
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings.: 2.15296751690799
It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening.: 2.3568608293910707
For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter.: 1.959944036589993
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr.: 2.2530473303742453
Darcy they had only seen at church.: 1.5012696212064884
The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room.: 2.088375385913163
Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.: 2.1779040741938833
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs.: 1.7412867216220842
Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much.: 1.772380541729274
He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr.: 2.1215950360081446
_His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out,  "What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?: 2.13518280846598
What is it you are talking of?: 1.8843253038152281
What are you telling Miss Bennet?: 5.164207145345448
"Of music!: 3.8356318059612002
It is of all subjects my delight.: 1.7159548000529963
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste.: 1.932641054380168
If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient.: 3.387314375098867
And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply.: 1.631756889315006
I am confident that she would have performed delightfully.: 2.3098863989853426
How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"  Mr.: 1.5516688702672368
Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.: 2.6775127428085477
"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal."  "I assure you, Madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice.: 2.772735550191546
She practises very constantly."  "So much the better.: 1.400047871414033
It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.: 2.466856859623522
I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs.: 2.005760401929019
Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in Mrs.: 2.205306460088446
Jenkinson's room.: 2.0410435312122233
She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house."  Mr.: 2.7564660310899427
Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made no answer.: 2.1553034498770023
When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.: 2.325077005496239
Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte, stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance.: 1.8372928785699199
Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,  "You mean to frighten me, Mr.: 2.4464940652545155
Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me?: 1.8284541969040897
But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.: 2.133678856102588
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others.: 2.0079749039274053
My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me."  "I shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own."  Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.: 2.377360022220779
Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear."  "I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.: 2.456080751963799
"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried Colonel Fitzwilliam.: 2.0702687647226274
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did?: 2.3132486042232414
He danced only four dances!: 1.568976389169389
I am sorry to pain you--but so it was.: 2.26337495227448
He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.: 1.9705925526170964
Darcy, you cannot deny the fact."  "I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party."  "True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room.: 2.1660002369497557
Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?: 2.1558532765414666
My fingers wait your orders."  "Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers."  "Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.: 2.2413861737932153
"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?"  "I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying to him.: 2.0912896371001377
I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done."  "My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do.: 2.0246686964988756
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the trouble of practising.: 2.39627490899918
It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution."  Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right.: 2.2373374216064486
You have employed your time much better.: 1.4179707999536908
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think any thing wanting.: 1.6655132655866196
We neither of us perform to strangers."  Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of.: 2.057549944072527
Elizabeth immediately began playing again.: 1.3190297630983356
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy,  "Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master.: 2.7879471700064467
She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's.: 2.2547140799819076
Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."  Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.: 2.2673098397048896
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.: 1.783606563425066
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home.: 2.2624724367351963
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane, while Mrs.: 2.1119996831697705
Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor.: 1.910864748619479
As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr.: 2.021108722861633
Darcy, and Mr.: 3.24608694329029
Darcy only, entered the room.: 1.6857268830120906
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within.: 1.7346805593725285
Darcy!: 10.466239490892104
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr.: 2.7069124347954627
Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before.: 2.1477132120475226
He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London."  "Perfectly so--I thank you."  She found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short pause, added,  "I think I have understood that Mr.: 2.641915282574149
Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?"  "I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future.: 2.1778951200473484
He has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing."  "If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there.: 2.090770422467415
But perhaps Mr.: 1.0444095627939656
Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle."  "I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it up, as soon as any eligible purchase offers."  Elizabeth made no answer.: 2.3028462392674682
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.: 2.5022171949582477
He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable house.: 2.1455224119326015
Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.: 2.628471180100581
Collins first came to Hunsford."  "I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object."  "Mr.: 2.3715576249255843
My friend has an excellent understanding--though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr.: 2.0787988003494804
Collins as the wisest thing she ever did.: 1.4559603420200102
She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her."  "It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends."  "An easy distance do you call it?: 2.6154078882272893
It is nearly fifty miles."  "And what is fifty miles of good road?: 1.922115688209905
Little more than half a day's journey.: 3.1620409420458455
"I should never have said Mrs.: 3.275287197204684
Collins was settled _near_ her family."  "It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.: 2.5308881846980222
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far."  As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,  "I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family.: 2.2787654308887753
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.: 1.7236003016429522
But that is not the case _here_.: 3.4013986080957603
Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance."  Mr.: 1.7923532022658943
Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_You_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.: 2.258928781741765
_You_ cannot have been always at Longbourn."  Elizabeth looked surprised.: 2.211092538305785
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,  "Are you pleased with Kent?"  A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from their walk.: 2.20825512490131
The tête-à-tête surprised them.: 1.304006691810016
Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body, went away.: 2.210283351276738
"What can be the meaning of this!" said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone.: 2.7257384261069846
"My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way."  But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable from the time of year.: 2.3484217570997017
All field sports were over.: 1.5453267678587839
Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.: 2.291652500391172
They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt.: 1.905194345068364
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.: 2.1528806870529134
Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand.: 2.3394403933476617
It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself.: 1.9773871191829644
He seldom appeared really animated.: 1.252034493960318
Collins knew not what to make of him.: 2.0958627585036242
Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself seriously to work to find it out.--She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success.: 2.173936800557127
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable.: 2.37169194438847
It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.: 2.403718592737272
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.: 2.3531394064594573
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam.: 1.5573376633797944
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr.: 2.2534683973480902
Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.: 1.9225329074699469
CHAPTER X.: 1.046627341480735
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly meet Mr.: 1.7624849347724156
Darcy.--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a favourite haunt of hers.--How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd!--Yet it did, and even a third.: 1.97813381649936
It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.: 1.878161073773443
He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr.: 2.003621611423364
Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too.: 2.223130343945228
His words seemed to imply it.: 1.7771391696218328
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?: 1.4871317523075478
She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter.: 2.0818852471213973
It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.: 2.173118101924706
She was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr.: 1.9413067271061561
Are you going much farther?"  "No, I should have turned in a moment."  And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.: 2.46097646476427
"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she.: 3.3304290532509393
"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again.: 2.058676265620661
But I am at his disposal.: 2.5294969957020106
He arranges the business just as he pleases."  "And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice.: 2.259747651724365
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr.: 2.0913798160732893
Darcy."  "He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.: 2.4820968307786893
"But so we all do.: 2.2347542471961845
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.: 2.021640107740858
I speak feelingly.: 2.6863635929784984
A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence."  "In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either.: 2.1074974911447804
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?"  "These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature.: 1.806035395053766
Younger sons cannot marry where they like."  "Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do."  "Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money."  "Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son?: 1.9049306776763089
Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."  He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.: 2.223906805131423
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said,  "I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal.: 1.863803571147789
But, perhaps his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her."  "No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must divide with me.: 2.3580294648595674
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy."  "Are you, indeed?: 2.4454638655312744
And pray what sort of guardians do you make?: 2.0751067649847084
Does your charge give you much trouble?: 1.4815409199892062
Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way."  As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth.: 1.9845702230458846
She directly replied,  "You need not be frightened.: 3.117691689065598
I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.: 3.0408797921877135
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs.: 2.25805589706785
Hurst and Miss Bingley.: 3.2518671984365706
I think I have heard you say that you know them."  "I know them a little.: 2.797090661369059
yes," said Elizabeth drily--"Mr.: 2.3541382796983266
Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.: 1.3362875301919612
Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."  "Care of him!--Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care.: 2.0948803150928863
It was all conjecture."  "What is it you mean?"  "It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing."  "You may depend upon my not mentioning it."  "And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley.: 2.4946438796270853
What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."  "Did Mr.: 2.0659892355272027
Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"  "I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady."  "And what arts did he use to separate them?"  "He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam smiling.: 2.117053979224892
"He only told me, what I have now told you."  Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation.: 2.38303628614051
After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.: 2.280435304480978
"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she.: 4.5582795092246915
"Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings.: 2.3264582319104927
Why was he to be the judge?"  "You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"  "I do not see what right Mr.: 2.0801539380598824
Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy." "But," she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.: 2.2837889135955387
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case."  "That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."  This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr.: 2.539612236759156
Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage.: 2.392432797056158
It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.: 1.9450288644077696
There could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr.: 2.716696988084437
Darcy could have such boundless influence.: 1.86152560672897
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr.: 2.2687372739440903
Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them.: 2.8420461774668877
"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London.: 1.7570460180704326
"To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of objection.: 2.2518223587085626
All loveliness and goodness as she is!: 1.872681685504763
Her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.: 1.9630177145386187
Neither could any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which Mr.: 2.25602207558379
Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach." When she thought of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.: 1.844503483532389
Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.: 2.23187405652605
Bingley for his sister.: 3.5049123884760798
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr.: 1.761918528838548
Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.: 1.9426989677876736
Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr.: 2.2241097596487895
Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home.: 1.9465253979121067
CHAPTER XI.: 1.046627341480735
When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr.: 2.503111259418528
Darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent.: 1.822596208966431
They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.: 1.828984828020928
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded.: 2.1759789380368666
Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings.: 2.544495771277099
She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent, without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.: 2.5136268088508764
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her.: 2.2970942301882156
But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr.: 2.0290682582821438
Darcy walk into the room.: 1.9800177452522028
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.: 1.876418941205088
She answered him with cold civility.: 1.7038750435879368
He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room.: 2.2342580794429594
Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.: 2.343961134018178
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began,  "In vain have I struggled.: 1.8286946898941874
My feelings will not be repressed.: 3.60784865475761
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you."  Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.: 2.1555650969451996
She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent.: 1.8510746256356025
This he considered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her, immediately followed.: 2.2744928399178814
He spoke well, but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride.: 2.838905936079502
His sense of her inferiority--of its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.: 1.7081516988246246
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand.: 2.152058432325567
As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer.: 2.699276139381322
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said,  "In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned.: 2.2599636844422277
It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you.: 2.1148441424289963
But I cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly.: 2.230635211110148
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one.: 2.189393867724578
It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration.: 2.8212917524403385
The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation."  Mr.: 1.7761211414565468
Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise.: 2.1014098621228348
His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature.: 2.256605266358404
The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful.: 2.513999517509792
At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,  "And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!: 2.9629321879462385
But it is of small importance."  "I might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?: 2.294284731753912
Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil?: 1.7045320496410115
But I have other provocations.: 2.759734287235979
You know I have.: 1.7754861913878615
Had not my own feelings decided against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?"  As she pronounced these words, Mr.: 2.117347713636513
Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued.: 2.184392807756673
"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.: 2.9108504751778255
You dare not, you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind."  She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.: 2.1944143950896815
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.: 3.3299577497835653
"Can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated.: 2.7109483230257685
With assumed tranquillity he then replied, "I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.: 2.4388971973067695
Towards _him_ I have been kinder than towards myself."  Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.: 1.971394851074642
Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided.: 1.8016019354553234
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr.: 1.4535075610412391
Wickham.: 6.2836587095573595
On this subject, what can you have to say?: 3.553216759096895
"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?"  "His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed."  "And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy.: 2.1961208108026717
"You have reduced him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty.: 1.776289043751898
You have withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for him.: 2.0514068206196545
You have done all this!: 2.694781590964929
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule."  "And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, "is your opinion of me!: 2.3493047476689055
This is the estimation in which you hold me!: 1.8541004585971805
My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed!: 1.8382005938404584
But perhaps," added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.: 1.7891581717201166
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater policy concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by every thing.: 2.068339457642718
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.: 1.4241651551486592
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.: 1.7118221469459993
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?: 1.709503211543484
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?"  Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said,  "You are mistaken, Mr.: 1.9287428388006473
She went on.: 28.320419667165687
"From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."  "You have said quite enough, madam.: 2.2427247046757692
I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.: 2.019003961131976
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great.: 2.6236619487565553
She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour.: 2.0466542716937957
Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it.: 2.0913722771312293
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr.: 2.1078164215304533
Darcy!: 10.466239490892104
that he should have been in love with her for so many months!: 3.259412242937415
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible!: 2.356187719099209
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection.: 1.4345972002805707
Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.: 1.8331420636558005
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.: 1.9805058680374825
CHAPTER XII.: 1.046627341480735
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes.: 2.107232523866969
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise.: 2.091969828447629
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr.: 2.0130153852089148
Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.: 2.272868335165379
The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.: 2.203811697602605
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park.: 2.2167165498999766
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.: 2.405715359485287
She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr.: 1.9041733258200715
Darcy, she was directly retreating.: 3.9825227781860906
But the person who advanced, was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name.: 2.6443852100743745
She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr.: 2.0945091253076935
Darcy, she moved again towards the gate.: 1.8670576069589007
He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.: 2.0836294717488832
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"--And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.: 2.4206126132275054
With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand.--The envelope itself was likewise full.--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.: 1.8571593799152806
It was dated from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--       "Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the      apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments,      or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to      you.: 2.0162553655832847
I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling      myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both,      cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation,      and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been      spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.: 2.4743794766473077
You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your      attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I      demand it of your justice.: 2.1042773693603407
"Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal      magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.: 2.146421036298081
Wickham.--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of      my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who      had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who      had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,      to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could      be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--But      from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally      bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in      future secured, when the following account of my actions and their      motives has been read.--If, in the explanation of them which is      due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which      may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry.--The      necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--I      had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with      others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other      young woman in the country.--But it was not till the evening of the      dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a      serious attachment.--I had often seen him in love before.--At that      ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made      acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that      Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general      expectation of their marriage.: 2.1581595061198176
Your sister I also watched.--Her look and      manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any      symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the      evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with      pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of      sentiment.--If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have      been in an error.: 2.0324352599122766
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make      the latter probable.--If it be so, if I have been misled by such      error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been      unreasonable.: 2.262079929498464
But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity      of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given      the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her      temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was      desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will      venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually      influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be      indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial      conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to      the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged      to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my      own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to      my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of      repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to      an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to      forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes      must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother's      family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that      total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed      by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by      your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you.: 1.9138809647740271
He had before believed her to return his      affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--But Bingley has      great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment      than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived      himself, was no very difficult point.: 1.951308947719798
There is but one part of my conduct in the      whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is      that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to      conceal from him your sister's being in town.: 2.0798749186732417
I knew it myself, as      it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant      of it.--That they might have met without ill consequence, is      perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough      extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--Perhaps this      concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--It is done, however,      and it was done for the best.--On this subject I have nothing more      to say, no other apology to offer.: 2.1329094123907204
If I have wounded your sister's      feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which      governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have      not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more      weighty accusation, of having injured Mr.: 2.2013630007896103
Wickham, I can only      refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my      family.: 2.0791227532197953
Wickham is the son of a very      respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the      Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his      trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on      George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore      liberally bestowed.: 2.3923328887077346
As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think      of him in a very different manner.: 2.542128855175277
The vicious propensities--the      want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge      of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man      of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of      seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.: 2.100590533962631
Darcy could not have.: 5.042094155808394
Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.: 1.7279754645075311
Wickham has created, a      suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his      real character.: 1.685054758826437
It adds even another motive.: 1.265469916480229
My excellent father      died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr.: 1.7853003653761492
His own      father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these      events, Mr.: 1.506743044237803
Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally      resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it      unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary      advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be      benefited.: 1.8518866127113778
He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,      and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would      be a very insufficient support therein.: 2.1364895722796584
I knew that Mr.: 1.2586635645675484
The business was therefore soon settled.: 1.5030456663660392
He resigned all      claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could      ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three      thousand pounds.: 2.0663907145573996
I      thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his      society in town.: 2.1165116655275527
In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his      studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all      restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.: 1.623609176717766
For      about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the      incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied      to me again by letter for the presentation.: 2.1021677368068614
His circumstances, he      assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were      exceedingly bad.: 2.3824576853596526
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his      circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me      to others, as in his reproaches to myself.: 1.890044347880013
After this period, every      appearance of acquaintance was dropt.: 1.589393217557821
How he lived I know not.: 2.0854550089879518
I      must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget      myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce      me to unfold to any human being.: 1.910332068515045
Having said thus much, I feel no      doubt of your secrecy.: 2.0720420531302444
My sister, who is more than ten years my      junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel      Fitzwilliam, and myself.: 2.471088088779017
About a year ago, she was taken from      school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last      summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;      and thither also went Mr.: 2.002147437832189
Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by      her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,      whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his      kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe      herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.: 2.2044661141961
She was then but      fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her      imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to      herself.: 2.2191990095539857
You may imagine what I felt      and how I acted.: 1.87109833084066
Regard for my sister's credit and feelings      prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr.: 2.1085028140096584
Wickham, who left      the place immediately, and Mrs.: 2.049545992853834
Younge was of course removed from      her charge.: 2.0238067170365115
Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my      sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot      help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a      strong inducement.: 2.593096821555153
His revenge would have been complete indeed.: 2.2659705283135154
This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we      have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject      it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty      towards Mr.: 2.2548507088389145
Wickham.: 6.2836587095573595
I know not in what manner, under what form of      falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to      be wondered at.: 1.8307625568346868
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing      concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and      suspicion certainly not in your inclination.: 1.8821580821862
You may possibly      wonder why all this was not told you last night.: 1.9791359131790478
If your abhorrence of      _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented      by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may      be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find      some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course      of the morning.: 2.0972321094767357
I will only add, God bless you.: 2.284962231434443
"FITZWILLIAM DARCY."     CHAPTER XIII.: 1.5438762424662986
If Elizabeth, when Mr.: 2.270052897276803
Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents.: 2.2747892161684544
But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.: 2.271618607710772
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.: 1.739480089406549
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.: 1.9071017212508201
With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield.: 1.8551200444104785
His belief of her sister's insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice.: 2.1130349284488106
He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.: 2.2767335444721204
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.: 1.7692893568177264
Wickham, when she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.: 1.8347235825163313
She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false!: 1.8849874491211505
This cannot be!: 3.466539223142853
This must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.: 2.294242137879129
In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.: 2.103511165746609
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr.: 2.0746382296952985
Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words.: 2.0917413468119586
So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to the will, the difference was great.: 1.843289697286209
But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.: 1.8428173607273786
She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with little success.: 2.0915799613714126
On both sides it was only assertion.: 2.189283543907125
Again she read on.: 1.6140088040938085
But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to render Mr.: 1.9069609392918574
Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.: 2.030884371233964
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr.: 1.6015591143784562
She had never heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance.: 2.228721370949303
As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of enquiring.: 2.566230446690042
His countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.: 1.705448755412463
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.: 1.6530204193978397
Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr.: 2.1373380908090294
Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance.: 1.4120778727902654
But no such recollection befriended her.: 1.7587317456961618
She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.: 2.189217447126552
After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read.: 1.6741522264344588
But, alas!: 1.042567136558318
the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question.: 1.9644833333156033
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr.: 2.1526234567531497
Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration.: 2.6260667231444144
Philips's.: 6.295691631921961
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.: 1.4445100853627215
She was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before.: 1.707626611650225
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct.: 2.169430581544604
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr.: 1.8027242262033094
Darcy--that Mr.: 1.347056033703136
She remembered also, that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr.: 1.9502209069253276
Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father, would always prevent his exposing the son.: 2.227390869742588
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned!: 2.1524425999497905
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn.: 1.8173717443198194
Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr.: 3.1180252802373465
Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits.: 2.2489708062435048
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr.: 2.1506433142568904
Bingley, was incomprehensible.: 4.3781054516137745
"How despicably have I acted!" she cried.--"I, who have prided myself on my discernment!--I, who have valued myself on my abilities!: 1.904294452725725
But vanity, not love, has been my folly.--Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned.: 1.999573275758551
Till this moment, I never knew myself."  From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr.: 1.8907773669994294
Darcy's explanation _there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.: 2.491689619605606
Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.--How could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been.--Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane.--She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility.: 2.1900996017005094
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe.: 2.020637008039546
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.: 1.9799283181769842
It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before.: 2.1356075151358773
After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.: 2.0389604476725833
She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr.: 1.8391387026988786
Darcy, only for a few minutes to take leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.--Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it.: 1.9537798065271634
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object.: 1.9899560833328913
CHAPTER XIV.: 1.046627341480735
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr.: 2.128174849260597
Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings.: 1.8678933742465673
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting, that had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been.: 2.3881945123359016
"What would she have said?--how would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself.: 1.7059247953257368
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.--"I assure you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do.: 2.6021725843609183
But I am particularly attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!--They were excessively sorry to go!: 2.1168120996986324
But so they always are.: 1.3859869389974357
The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year.: 1.5545846836926975
Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure."  "I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it.--I must be in town next Saturday."  "Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.: 2.407824307997764
I expected you to stay two months.: 1.6800592322172627
I told Mrs.: 1.0521499623212256
Collins so before you came.: 1.8751399134522728
There can be no occasion for your going so soon.: 2.1286182256198276
Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight."  "But my father cannot.--He wrote last week to hurry my return."  "Oh!: 1.6770209199253747
your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.--Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father.: 1.8289740148077358
"Mrs.: 1.1100384243248806
Collins, you must send a servant with them.: 2.4135048452903374
It is highly improper.: 1.4156699814016243
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go with her.--Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr.: 1.7983912998303582
Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--I am excessively attentive to all those things.: 1.989267561957796
You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs.: 2.4270684120915065
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone."  "My uncle is to send a servant for us."  "Oh!--Your uncle!--He keeps a man-servant, does he?--I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things.: 1.9855349074493933
Bromley, of course.--If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to."  Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.: 2.188523762803003
Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.: 1.8630560312589355
Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.: 3.0149805054954744
She studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different.: 1.6436063476481928
When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.: 2.0451175521401366
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.: 1.9356950278015312
In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.: 2.0843432682828724
They were hopeless of remedy.: 1.2312549426845436
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement?: 1.9400600393280132
Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing.: 1.960507709387807
Anxiety on Jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr.: 2.0817168678485487
His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend.: 2.067150435241728
How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!: 2.129579705710826
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.: 1.9967510119429686
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay, as they had been at first.: 2.3685293796395164
When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.: 2.011964469075846
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr.: 1.3139551549546267
Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.: 1.9812323296019447
Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it.: 2.1825044774964915
The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you.: 1.8122560202581826
Our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly."  Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.: 2.133444291879124
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_ feel the obliged.: 2.168806191079648
Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity replied,  "It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably.: 2.339181623634169
We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.: 1.778328613711739
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.: 1.9427713803244853
You see on what a footing we are.: 1.495520016229218
You see how continually we are engaged there.: 1.609500221339582
In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings."  Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.: 2.2030815375746733
I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so.: 3.1868877284150585
Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs.: 1.9082723536634913
Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be as well to be silent.: 2.1371427582689244
Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.: 2.3728958134208207
We seem to have been designed for each other."  Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.: 2.1651190641250255
Poor Charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to such society!--But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.: 2.165195749002224
Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.: 1.8937544006939868
At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.: 2.1439388555190524
After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr.: 1.6958656732762476
Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr.: 2.5604069734340267
Gardiner, though unknown.: 2.087823443519035
He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.: 2.403770705315688
"But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here."  Elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.: 2.3802454292411097
"Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have happened!"  "A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.: 2.197639667184459
"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!--How much I shall have to tell!"  Elizabeth privately added, "And how much I shall have to conceal."  Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr.: 2.0208910674804166
Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them.: 2.004840678204944
But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.: 2.490491375488106
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr.: 2.0609191854258944
To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister farther.: 2.4201533826369315
It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr.: 2.2545790582798313
is not this an agreeable surprise?"  "And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia; "but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there." Then shewing her purchases: "Look here, I have bought this bonnet.: 1.7767649194135164
I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.: 3.0426554138761377
I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better."  And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, "Oh!: 2.0548476976380368
"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer!: 2.5223267322974063
It would be such a delicious scheme, and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all.: 2.7053815310512803
Good Heaven!: 1.4876052094392627
Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton."  "Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down to table.: 2.441450665632121
"What do you think?: 3.3094874571617354
It is excellent news, capital news, and about a certain person that we all like."  Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he need not stay.: 1.9597334125504517
Lydia laughed, and said,  "Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.: 2.1132056235662753
You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared!: 2.0249042539025863
I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say.: 2.0379112565228277
But he is an ugly fellow!: 2.2042758936298448
I am glad he is gone.: 2.659780765118508
I never saw such a long chin in my life.: 3.0132324259450125
Well, but now for my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?: 1.985371029161007
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King.: 2.630096328258275
There's for you!: 2.0478897628169745
She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay.: 2.3838178048426135
"I am sure there is not on _his_.: 3.8689242466787
I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her.: 1.499018204244449
Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing?"  Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal!: 1.9114229597802075
As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.: 2.5695612131077685
"How nicely we are crammed in!" cried Lydia.: 2.6354455422044785
"I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox!: 2.3313019446613095
And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all, since you went away.: 2.2175137256332667
Have you seen any pleasant men?: 1.3494302289508666
Have you had any flirting?: 1.5835848488211086
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.: 2.196157215622175
Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.: 1.7154919182259585
She is almost three and twenty!: 1.53696049324951
Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty!: 1.984236392516261
My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think.: 1.9297724448335418
Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it.: 2.095104296344293
Lord!: 2.083195939557797
Dear me!: 1.77628221169138
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's.: 1.8508613361935873
Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs.: 2.0090364437946024
Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs.: 2.157717004858939
We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a lady,--only think what fun!: 1.6083138713440068
Not a soul knew of it, but Col.: 2.35216393193345
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!: 2.4465576581860833
When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least.: 2.4921992062824967
Lord!: 2.083195939557797
how I laughed!: 1.2519414507805755
Forster.: 7.1111920105754525
I thought I should have died.: 2.6511326702306253
And _that_ made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."  With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn.: 1.9301651618841769
Their reception at home was most kind.: 1.6227000321797522
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr.: 1.8363600613165667
Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth,  "I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."  Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs.: 1.8486081341506635
Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.: 2.400348787446285
Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!: 2.729506002251662
as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too.: 2.3413510604642047
And then when we came away it was such fun!: 1.849197299018587
I thought we never should have got into the coach.: 1.660336432326689
I was ready to die of laughter.: 1.7135356209992614
And then we were so merry all the way home!: 2.054483153477178
we talked and laughed so loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!"  To this, Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures.: 2.005925627795571
They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds.: 1.9026950628401642
But I confess they would have no charms for _me_.: 1.7660725649422724
She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.: 2.05188259262986
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.: 2.0256690100477655
It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.: 3.1432227689506687
There was another reason too for her opposition.: 1.5549750786901013
The comfort to _her_, of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression.: 1.909895602152868
In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.: 2.060119096447526
She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.: 2.1513141604723187
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.: 2.482544794064943
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.: 2.2238876912257024
Darcy and herself.: 2.5069991271807384
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.: 1.897986525284962
She was sorry that Mr.: 1.2864881919650697
Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.: 1.9558709659111422
"His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment."  "Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.: 2.1763783294026537
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"  "Blame you!: 2.6461512432586822
What a stroke was this for poor Jane!: 1.350576201059055
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual.: 2.050478768028467
Nor was Darcy's vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.: 2.1074342226514062
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other.: 2.013908781368296
"This will not do," said Elizabeth.: 4.080494085204764
"You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing.: 2.3557913371573362
For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.: 2.624624872545633
"I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she.: 4.03101715703888
"Wickham so very bad!: 1.6858559220871883
It is almost past belief.: 1.331582936882854
Darcy!: 10.466239490892104
dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.: 2.3399060157510716
Such a disappointment!: 1.2656144183405085
and having to relate such a thing of his sister!: 2.240514523433833
It is really too distressing.: 1.3831169933706433
I am sure you must feel it so."  "Oh!: 2.7644038986887227
no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both.: 1.7312391747655453
I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.: 2.022993189713369
Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather."  "Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance!: 2.0690126678613807
such an openness and gentleness in his manner."  "There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men.: 1.8764289464636394
One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it."  "I never thought Mr.: 2.7947389603154273
Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do."  "And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason.: 2.2317046830321776
It is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind.: 2.3512100402190246
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty."  "Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now."  "Indeed I could not.: 2.2132998147431304
I was uncomfortable enough.: 1.2521457681455872
I was very uncomfortable, I may say unhappy.: 2.1554402779460773
And with no one to speak to, of what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had!: 2.232511772303236
how I wanted you!"  "How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr.: 1.6900633263130376
Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved."  "Certainly.: 2.21027854251804
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging.: 1.851375896685897
I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham's character."  Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, "Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.: 2.088319970443023
What is your own opinion?"  "That it ought not to be attempted.: 2.5692536198209805
Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public.: 1.8265445842761272
Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light.: 2.1694699024859134
I am not equal to it.: 3.8652249759536588
Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.: 2.048035509882365
At present I will say nothing about it."  "You are quite right.: 2.795050446075112
To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever.: 1.504364220606162
We must not make him desperate."  The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.: 2.3513010280761764
She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either.: 2.0139802561611666
But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbad the disclosure.: 2.3895148009673584
She dared not relate the other half of Mr.: 1.717285826966063
Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend.: 2.6647362191881045
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery.: 1.8922113176050892
"And then," said she, "if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.: 2.1705477649865155
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"  She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits.: 1.9808367859573832
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley.: 1.4700261447449812
Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity.: 2.112841050317124
"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs.: 3.4054089963832648
Bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of Jane's?: 2.6011751236524745
For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody.: 2.2377709282665905
I told my sister Philips so the other day.: 1.9803055539287697
But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London.: 2.475552263457556
Well, he is a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now.: 2.463245751748375
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every body too, who is likely to know."  "I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more."  "Oh, well!: 2.699016868019628
it is just as he chooses.: 2.852450800555566
Nobody wants him to come.: 1.9496929636067943
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it.: 2.410004592994128
Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done."  But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.: 2.1698179670782305
"Well, Lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they?: 2.2662808163142674
Well, well, I only hope it will last.: 2.6292683926213316
And what sort of table do they keep?: 1.7020509469121812
Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say.: 2.915886192379132
There is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping, I dare say."  "No, nothing at all."  "A great deal of good management, depend upon it.: 2.489894870362947
Yes, yes.: 2.911274044471728
_They_ will take care not to outrun their income.: 2.2071603727592852
_They_ will never be distressed for money.: 1.687761803691013
Well, much good may it do them!: 1.4457430238839069
And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead.: 1.9948501221490984
They look upon it quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens."  "It was a subject which they could not mention before me."  "No.: 2.5123821526807677
It would have been strange if they had.: 2.674822495408113
But I make no doubt, they often talk of it between themselves.: 1.7655819709185565
_I_ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."     CHAPTER XVIII.: 1.622886288255208
The first week of their return was soon gone.: 1.524426195434358
The second began.: 1.2674378674225324
It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace.: 2.564541026440886
The dejection was almost universal.: 1.382952734711817
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.: 1.5261052146718483
What is to become of us!: 2.2392388839690303
What are we to do!" would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.: 2.1345488986937675
"How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?"  Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years ago.: 1.7656791178418028
I thought I should have broke my heart."  "I am sure I shall break _mine_," said Lydia.: 3.1783840984833547
"If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs.: 1.879596709281931
"Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton!: 2.035484675564749
But papa is so disagreeable."  "A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever."  "And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good," added Kitty.: 2.067481325562519
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn-house.: 1.7268033125552333
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.: 1.8028631080141697
Darcy's objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.: 1.8999336565839635
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs.: 1.7583894143983765
Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.: 2.110544779964664
A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.: 2.036562219281727
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs.: 1.7924681778260916
Forster, the delight of Mrs.: 2.0157888136666693
Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described.: 2.5431102935451166
Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.: 1.7684973335162286
Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia," said she, "though I am _not_ her particular friend.: 2.2500233458986765
As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go.: 2.3447823847810665
She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs.: 2.3086955923295642
Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home.: 2.162192680130665
He heard her attentively, and then said,  "Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances."  "If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair."  "Already arisen!" repeated Mr.: 2.1997101116592233
"What, has she frightened away some of your lovers?: 1.9133769267613006
But do not be cast down.: 2.265731602545442
Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly."  "Indeed you are mistaken.: 2.0872983834049004
I have no such injuries to resent.: 2.4914091101549833
It is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining.: 2.378456345542857
Excuse me--for I must speak plainly.: 1.9857055043070033
Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous.: 1.9685630593322103
A flirt too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.: 1.8498689714277166
She will follow wherever Lydia leads.: 1.337792593375144
Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled!: 1.444730074999152
my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?"  Mr.: 2.0897449751457198
Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,  "Do not make yourself uneasy, my love.: 2.0991211280189876
Wherever you and Jane are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three very silly sisters.: 2.0181446000986045
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton.: 1.7265222452513078
Let her go then.: 2.1240980888375636
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here.: 1.950698624918651
The officers will find women better worth their notice.: 1.3213594572103269
At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life."  With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.: 2.292966574753277
It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.: 3.0626320081927014
She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.: 1.9442180381335659
She saw with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers.: 2.14019739993675
She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown.: 2.6464510263173833
She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.: 2.1568995012562238
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?: 1.9916973780824196
They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.: 2.2376808500896668
Wickham for the last time.: 2.711430574740505
Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.: 1.83068665873616
Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.: 2.3630321807894417
He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man, asked her how she had liked him.: 2.093009554892474
Her answer was warmly in his favour.: 1.7313150860120339
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, "How long did you say that he was at Rosings?"  "Nearly three weeks."  "And you saw him frequently?"  "Yes, almost every day."  "His manners are very different from his cousin's."  "Yes, very different.: 2.5455649893827217
Darcy improves on acquaintance."  "Indeed!" cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her.: 2.3820398094907387
"And pray may I ask?" but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "Is it in address that he improves?: 2.4758337926625855
for I dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials."  "Oh, no!" said Elizabeth.: 2.661814719824208
"In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was."  While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.: 2.070675209959799
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added,  "When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."  Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents,  "You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr.: 2.0659136998139513
Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right.: 1.756445523781337
His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by.: 2.2450381018162187
I only fear that the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe.: 2.3123505185328437
His fear of her, has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart."  Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head.: 2.4998393824155056
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him.: 2.0933243838360345
The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.: 1.9877268537755253
When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs.: 1.5574231252093398
Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning.: 2.0434419481740504
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.: 1.7169644505955064
Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.: 2.1064474021738175
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.: 2.359593714520403
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort.: 2.1911040421219417
Respect, esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown.: 1.6761397588912783
But Mr.: 1.0561351882847272
Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.: 1.6552786623656661
He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments.: 1.827243864423233
This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.: 1.7247894747666315
Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband.: 2.649493569224304
But she had never felt so strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.: 1.7320154544166304
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.: 2.132942856987569
Their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp.: 2.1038674194093057
Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself.: 2.1104450782903243
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment.: 1.9302764763413933
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.: 2.3587799148245887
"But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to wish for.: 3.146927768971015
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.: 1.478491816023553
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized.: 1.9071144947985363
A scheme of which every part promises delight, can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation."  When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short.: 1.771141820337609
Those to her mother, contained little else, than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs.: 2.17939266211341
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn.: 1.7107810493609603
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.: 2.14436101276403
Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.: 1.9354252364732876
Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire.: 2.0591012059566447
In that county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs.: 2.2636084315950082
Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.: 1.4404083094931663
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.: 2.411526230161628
But it was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.: 2.1102582774462166
With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.: 2.130941092515376
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner.: 2.970114164765202
"But surely," said she, "I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."  The period of expectation was now doubled.: 2.0508750438201213
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival.: 2.105263910431501
But they did pass away, and Mr.: 1.8942978472587158
Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn.: 1.66180848352151
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.: 1.9958884828908108
One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.: 1.5009148700752124
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &c.: 2.5629082321531405
are sufficiently known.: 1.2655941974612752
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern.: 1.791529671180216
To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs.: 1.6528750452088488
Gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated.: 1.8373945597146146
It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.: 2.1146982676142625
In talking over their route the evening before, Mrs.: 1.7575475605169755
Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.: 2.597554210616769
"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?" said her aunt.: 2.1848875912260675
Wickham passed all his youth there, you know."  Elizabeth was distressed.: 2.329549748885512
She must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.: 1.818400650160364
They have some of the finest woods in the country."  Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce.: 2.265563372567855
The possibility of meeting Mr.: 2.3808717608477075
It would be dreadful!: 5.518137925980947
She blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk.: 1.9853904437365635
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer.: 1.9654639269550693
A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme.: 2.4344772423314662
To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.: 4.691322518027154

Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.: 1.9749838062021197
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.: 1.4904242222442832
They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.: 1.7996789303088452
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view.: 1.9333563921829204
They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.: 1.9429268800539363
It was a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.: 1.9310547312054047
Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely adorned.: 1.4041736187036307
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.: 1.7813302955572015
They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!: 2.103830038472626
They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned.: 1.8968452836214418
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken.: 1.5420658910166032
On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.: 2.4649388450722793
The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.: 1.8113107647338706
They followed her into the dining-parlour.: 2.0457579600681823
It was a large, well-proportioned room, handsomely fitted up.: 2.3438670600359304
The hill, crowned with wood, from which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.: 1.8369261093061413
Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight.: 2.1981399444478913
The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.: 2.220582307655572
"And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress!: 3.325401232101422
With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!: 1.5603343470008892
Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--But no,"--recollecting herself,--"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them."  This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.: 2.000439113549906
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really absent, but had not courage for it.: 1.8180854233473496
At length, however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.: 2.1682183318642307
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture.: 1.7480377129466218
She approached, and saw the likeness of Mr.: 1.8579106843464295
Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantle-piece.: 1.4338930911772743
Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.: 1.7271860332357505
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it.: 3.1364288919229324
"And that," said Mrs.: 2.5474953512066416
Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, "is my master--and very like him.: 1.7591444398476452
It was drawn at the same time as the other--about eight years ago."  "I have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs.: 2.0224917974578793
Gardiner, looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face.: 2.378881755200599
But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not."  Mrs.: 2.08377277449749
Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.: 2.24147054812787
"Does that young lady know Mr.: 1.4119088832512388
Darcy?"  Elizabeth coloured, and said--"A little."  "And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?"  "Yes, very handsome."  "I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.: 2.1553215308664884
This room was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then.: 1.7661446822212834
He was very fond of them."  This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr.: 2.050541238635469
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.: 2.591500755055878
"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mr.: 2.2142305780372937
yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long.: 2.0593434883033686
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him."  Mr.: 1.6983196796354647
Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs.: 1.5126006189452954
Reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.: 1.8829687135213227
I do not know who is good enough for him."  Mr.: 2.498136940216816
Gardiner smiled.: 1.6959017924080362
Elizabeth could not help saying, "It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so."  "I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows him," replied the other.: 2.8904652059758407
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old."  This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas.: 2.074126081096389
That he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest opinion.: 3.164973752109571
Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying,  "There are very few people of whom so much can be said.: 2.3256102264921634
You are lucky in having such a master."  "Yes, Sir, I know I am.: 2.463717321069062
If I was to go through the world, I could not meet with a better.: 2.8287964579563107
But I have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the world."  Elizabeth almost stared at her.--"Can this be Mr.: 2.0875360010608275
Darcy!" thought she.: 8.761619609817782
"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs.: 1.8928680314485207
"Yes, Ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just as affable to the poor."  Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.: 2.2003400355218834
Reynolds could interest her on no other point.: 1.5016426290337594
She related the subject of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain.: 3.332550707666354
Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.: 2.1569417618533473
"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever lived.: 3.0287196697291194
Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but themselves.: 1.6277666213394144
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name.: 2.1112841946507244
Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it.: 2.7948734435028375
To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men."  "In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought Elizabeth.: 2.1813876012904916
"This fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."  "Perhaps we might be deceived."  "That is not very likely; our authority was too good."  On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when last at Pemberley.: 2.292331046224873
"He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.: 3.36495611638594
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter the room.: 2.5281660415205405
"And this is always the way with him," she added.--"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment.: 2.0581322387585383
There is nothing he would not do for her."  The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were all that remained to be shewn.: 2.07521639689991
In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.: 2.317470452064192
In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger.: 1.9510624404696302
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.: 1.7339308058829757
At last it arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr.: 1.3839261827097575
Darcy, with such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her.: 2.4824623958395433
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.: 1.574164269462297
Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his father's life time.: 2.5890187764380856
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance.: 2.0038048823159653
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs.: 1.4248115276077078
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?: 1.507022560583227
As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--How much of good or evil must be done by him!: 1.9680913019667745
Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.: 2.035923427603431
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.: 1.8496748456577834
As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.: 1.9666602787779046
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.: 2.456220923275052
Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush.: 2.2477465396684875
Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr.: 1.6381966322118953
Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it.: 1.6918992542911986
Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most uncomfortable of her life.: 1.9473068290023752
Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.: 2.2421912241619397
At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.: 2.41477966816752
The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence.: 2.277944618858473
She was overpowered by shame and vexation.: 1.3227693228242656
Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world!: 2.2303647094722425
How strange must it appear to him!: 1.5147733279724263
In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!: 1.4584804090557504
It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again!: 1.9174837297411191
why did she come?: 1.540030540270245
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?: 1.9159200530547629
Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.: 2.239729050731694
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting.: 1.8568432135757205
That he should even speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her family!: 2.0821043381513196
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.: 1.5326123804506642
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when he put his letter into her hand!: 1.9549353154515081
She knew not what to think, nor how to account for it.: 2.2956435085061138
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene.: 2.183910487075635
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr.: 2.0083892514284063
Darcy then was.: 1.6247463076724613
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing, she was still dear to him.: 2.7833120058526246
Perhaps he had been civil, only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was not like ease.: 1.9911583495571563
They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.: 1.8353525348564712
Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.: 1.8123588542046989
With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten miles round.: 2.4337541147714115
It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.: 2.2147452488898853
They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.: 1.9784789411670134
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs.: 2.1766723586866377
Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr.: 2.2456739633106295
Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little.: 2.1282837038724898
Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance.: 2.8713924363333003
The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met.: 1.7844063608983811
Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them.: 1.9461561694213108
For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.: 2.6619824245909736
With a glance she saw, that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed.: 2.4089842341650267
Her colour changed, and she said no more.: 2.659468148715451
Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.: 2.2240973649075464
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself.: 2.3590676243302973
"What will be his surprise," thought she, "when he knows who they are!: 2.0903938814369756
He takes them now for people of fashion."  The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.: 2.313685587242518
That he was _surprised_ by the connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr.: 2.930421500628754
Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph.: 3.1167132490622422
It was consoling, that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush.: 2.127453068147413
The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr.: 2.0546680310989265
Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport.: 2.0680775220728007
Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder.: 1.8907000612029765
Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself.: 1.9079097108713068
Her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was she repeating, "Why is he so altered?: 1.9715092197256134
From what can it proceed?: 1.5616044536599154
It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened.: 2.1418018683518194
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this.: 1.6286640987433014
It is impossible that he should still love me."  After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.: 2.1557412701478667
It originated in Mrs.: 1.2679759737151384
Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's.: 2.208311984140062
Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together.: 2.715189634781938
After a short silence, the lady first spoke.: 2.9763646625615534
"They will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr.: 1.9857413624690368
Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr.: 1.8783392118169018
Bingley's name had been last mentioned between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged.: 2.324717987358664
They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought.: 2.022824737169959
Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased.: 2.1920179195981557
His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of the highest kind.: 2.5900679421351778
They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr.: 2.693281396395586
Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.: 1.6770957614611788
He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn.: 1.9434204117329088
She wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject.: 2.3796910943346954
At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.: 2.210644946759511
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over.: 1.5312571561057466
On Mr.: 1.0862161630409684
Gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness.: 2.365279909121253
Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.: 2.0310156078915598
"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.: 2.7746019563340476
"There _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.: 2.4377373079528506
It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention.: 2.382083054458512
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling."  "To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as Wickham; or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good.: 2.4172829302238545
But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable?"  Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.: 2.4364363241804945
"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied her uncle.: 3.3953956637518576
"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds."  Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing.: 2.119456981117652
"From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs.: 2.030024548694316
Gardiner, "I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body, as he has done by poor Wickham.: 2.3506926916230357
He has not an ill-natured look.: 2.1867145922323306
But to be sure, the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming character!: 2.416621236971493
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.: 1.6694881830792045
But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue."  Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire.: 2.2631265853965807
In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.: 2.451509127506762
Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of any thing else.: 2.3156180493307383
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr.: 1.9618841379008811
Darcy's civility, and above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.: 2.7224088227123024
CHAPTER II.: 1.063151314611428
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr.: 1.3471503869925296
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.: 1.7632409563882898
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle, driving up the street.: 2.1010599154416094
Elizabeth immediately recognising the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she expected.: 2.108722593433888
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business.: 1.9901189670698616
Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece.: 1.8931049927925485
While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing.: 2.0882703654655943
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.: 1.7850648171926287
She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.: 2.110894779107213
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place.: 1.7215539820166277
With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.: 1.7896920708807318
Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was only exceedingly shy.: 2.6909198337251294
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.: 1.5309765396865935
Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful.: 2.402869405531438
She was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.: 2.259670134254093
They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.: 2.427460375507095
He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.: 2.205415248554534
To Mr.: 1.1036130641772124
They had long wished to see him.: 2.2581442623939574
The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention.: 2.2048452029951506
The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr.: 1.414277339697751
Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love.: 1.7997142072069972
Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.: 1.761809242336359
Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.: 2.5296399490492747
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.: 2.3036407100892182
In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!: 2.2095913380712
how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a like manner.: 1.8588360165732098
But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane.: 2.8682981915511996
No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard.: 1.6243645012777215
Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister.: 1.768224794357511
On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.: 2.102204847118056
He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "It is above eight months.: 2.4254315675358447
We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield."  Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn.: 2.0541881141265366
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr.: 2.6886652837993923
Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.: 1.9570914279162817
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible.: 2.0056872972978805
Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.: 1.859723950422251
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose to depart, Mr.: 2.1426439507725212
Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr.: 1.6994357610255615
Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country.: 2.726046711721779
Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed.: 2.003826444280449
Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little.: 2.1266051472986693
Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.: 2.052599146248739
But she had no reason to fear Mr.: 3.1097652431248766
Gardiner's curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication.: 2.773224579443475
Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her.: 2.6165807949986317
They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.: 1.7290857802810542
Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.: 2.5896680222856054
They could not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known, would not have recognised it for Mr.: 2.390636555714224
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight.: 1.6698467957850918
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town, where the family did not visit.: 1.8734261256375637
It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.: 2.6038279474138197
Darcy afterwards discharged.: 1.178689545509458
As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out.: 2.220972050416476
She certainly did not hate him.: 1.3669443354123294
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced.: 2.0157753000403944
But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked.: 2.017487213310306
It was gratitude.--Gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.: 2.199451712069753
He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.: 1.9962577679412579
Such a change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.: 2.1448885153966626
She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.: 2.1776993452999536
Gardiner left them soon after breakfast.: 2.1354916313440757
The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.: 2.0039014218250957
CHAPTER III.: 1.063151314611428
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be renewed.: 2.0673256523352768
On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.: 1.9530889476055655
Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.: 2.061277472137994
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs.: 2.06795721734024
Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London.: 2.782369104998293
Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved.: 1.6953736554982286
Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.: 2.0596064331498853
By Mrs.: 1.1100384243248804
Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments.: 2.159924823447622
It was first broken by Mrs.: 1.259440237239824
Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.: 1.8270405997822767
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention.: 2.784037727642629
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much.: 2.1547592609437634
Her own thoughts were employing her.: 1.6214277566813957
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.: 1.9827090970142796
She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.: 1.9740174525610403
After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family.: 1.9357216185253414
She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.: 2.788159167300489
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs.: 1.8665562470609818
There was now employment for the whole party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected them round the table.: 2.6558103028038547
While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.: 1.7566594896442724
Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.: 2.507949702201254
He had been some time with Mr.: 2.7393277026398106
Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning.: 2.29504049189747
No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room.: 1.8991860174926225
Darcy were by no means over.: 2.4188719324381966
Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.: 2.719259164582584
Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,  "Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?: 2.2622908508740363
They must be a great loss to _your_ family."  In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone.: 2.270533917660188
To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own.: 2.1125382936683605
He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.: 1.8970041270152216
Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more.: 2.195862349876724
Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.: 2.128481433417214
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned; and while Mr.: 1.544501066578308
Darcy was attending them to their carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress.: 2.113469218576423
But Georgiana would not join her.: 1.3971228386328616
Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.: 2.4272596621133853
When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.: 2.3973419293589022
"How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr.: 1.8454167815167728
Darcy," she cried; "I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.: 2.198351851157454
She is grown so brown and coarse!: 2.5066105830199077
Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again."  However little Mr.: 1.9566492560298634
Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.: 1.656623080867186
Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.: 1.848667447954345
Her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines.: 1.7744491348636566
Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them.: 2.109902664726569
They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable."  Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.: 2.493023291827199
He was resolutely silent however; and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued,  "I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_ a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time."  "Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but _that_ was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."  He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.: 2.203832978405568
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.: 1.9151168109116818
They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every thing but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs.: 2.7709252914440836
Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs.: 3.120657073032565
Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject.: 2.104462285453701
CHAPTER IV.: 1.0767509623679594
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere.: 1.9733362919093393
Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.: 2.1215350781688134
The one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago.: 1.705632480946618
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence.: 1.7836511151043204
It was to this effect:       "Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of      a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming      you--be assured that we are all well.: 1.9970315084999675
What I have to say relates to      poor Lydia.: 2.2554963741072442
To Kitty, however, it does not      seem so wholly unexpected.: 2.837046421292068
Thoughtless and indiscreet I      can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it)      marks nothing bad at heart.: 1.638438601141552
His choice is disinterested at least,      for he must know my father can give her nothing.: 1.8976517671600088
Our poor mother      is sadly grieved.: 1.515581776790159
My father bears it better.: 1.3093717121353894
How thankful am I,      that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must      forget it ourselves.: 1.713303191775819
They were off Saturday night about twelve, as      is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at      eight.: 1.397717581879155
My dear Lizzy, they must      have passed within ten miles of us.: 2.140727824717877
Colonel Forster gives us reason      to expect him here soon.: 1.5044526435341772
I am afraid you will not be able to make      it out, but I hardly know what I have written."  Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.: 2.3684946532767324
"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried      letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not      confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer      for being coherent.: 2.079956130535984
Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would      write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.: 2.954803522908353
Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day      before, not many hours after the express.: 1.8066099540700418
Though Lydia's short      letter to Mrs.: 2.274057335317701
F.: 1.0860123504838626
gave them to understand that they were going to      Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief      that W.: 1.6917283356169277
never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which      was repeated to Colonel F.: 2.231312722187918
intending to trace their route.: 1.3284646812249017
He did trace them easily to      Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed      into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them      from Epsom.: 1.4661457841737136
All that is known after this is, that they were seen      to continue the London road.: 2.344356520260291
I know not what to think.: 3.141943050117219
After making      every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F.: 1.4348584362048487
came on into      Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at      the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such      people had been seen to pass through.: 2.590988979501768
With the kindest concern he      came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner      most creditable to his heart.: 1.9514428437716846
I am sincerely grieved for him and      Mrs.: 1.55238865562027
F.: 1.0860123504838626
but no one can throw any blame on them.: 1.8991751562900243
Our distress, my      dear Lizzy, is very great.: 2.787048790443191
My father and mother believe the worst,      but I cannot think so ill of him.: 2.6151630811107203
Many circumstances might make it      more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to      pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design      against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely,      can I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible.: 1.9192847912857764
I grieve to      find, however, that Colonel F.: 2.5086595994257994
is not disposed to depend upon their      marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he      feared W.: 1.8642881507927844
was not a man to be trusted.: 2.3625040133749886
My poor mother is really ill      and keeps her room.: 1.4835861219638218
Could she exert herself it would be better, but      this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life      saw him so affected.: 2.6981523292550342
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed      their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot      wonder.: 2.1875385765833673
I am not so      selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.: 3.267162659018642
Adieu.: 3.7230180879135117
I      take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,      but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging      you all to come here, as soon as possible.: 2.3856363911840868
I know my dear uncle and      aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have      still something more to ask of the former.: 2.388710661684673
What      he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress      will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest      way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again      to-morrow evening.: 2.1913550235259667
In such an exigence my uncle's advice and      assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately      comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness."  "Oh!: 2.211783610075357
where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and Mr.: 2.2601169587858343
Darcy appeared.: 2.975613800504615
Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.: 2.2323233824135924
I must find Mr.: 1.2642924500058466
what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a minute, but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr.: 2.0570417676102206
You are not well enough;--you cannot go yourself."  Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.: 1.9952472900190217
Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home, instantly.: 2.2510409334360437
On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, "Let me call your maid.: 2.4905599985471225
Is there nothing you could take, to give you present relief?--A glass of wine;--shall I get you one?--You are very ill."  "No, I thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.: 2.0457987894168213
"There is nothing the matter with me.: 3.16212270988057
I am quite well.: 3.394956071203686
I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn."  She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word.: 2.0801928241142673
Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence.: 2.014759150048696
At length, she spoke again.: 4.8586737877411945
"I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news.: 3.1984098118827844
It cannot be concealed from any one.: 2.494456219549023
My youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown herself into the power of--of Mr.: 1.63066102274822
Wickham.: 6.2836587095573595
_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest.: 1.9733305818437372
She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever."  Darcy was fixed in astonishment.: 1.9677931999641316
"When I consider," she added, in a yet more agitated voice, "that _I_ might have prevented it!--_I_ who knew what he was.: 2.3956189660074587
Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family!: 2.1245820885539435
Had his character been known, this could not have happened.: 2.118447322484538
But it is all, all too late now."  "I am grieved, indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved--shocked.: 2.3864830223766536
But is it certain, absolutely certain?"  "Oh yes!--They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland."  "And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"  "My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour.: 2.2044102683098696
But nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done.: 2.0179746621424086
How are they even to be discovered?: 1.7735926724818492
I have not the smallest hope.: 3.219898719431216
It is every way horrible!"  Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.: 1.9543877285264033
"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--Oh!: 1.6187257997525555
had I known what I ought, what I dared, to do!: 1.9903463949241762
But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too much.: 1.9205427709593097
Wretched, wretched, mistake!"  Darcy made no answer.: 1.4734797931434338
He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy.: 2.030869736344456
Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.: 1.6001321519891314
Her power was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.: 1.638387100268338
She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.: 2.251980837582729
It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.: 2.1676361942688622
But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.: 2.716347062477778
Lydia--the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern.: 2.2516663124118175
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress.--But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.: 1.7881607421117118
This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day."  "Oh, yes.: 2.4860409946986795
Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy.: 2.539220051799777
Say that urgent business calls us home immediately.: 1.359353939943698
Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible.--I know it cannot be long."  He readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting, look, went away.: 1.7114367152840482
As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.: 2.101385492765026
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.: 1.753683961780387
But if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment.: 1.8715647675454594
Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business.: 1.8605726552741475
No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation.: 2.509732169647062
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared incomprehensible.: 1.974440660280828
But now it was all too natural.: 2.2879873193657874
For such an attachment as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.: 1.953113717681734
She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body.: 2.2977495683282743
Sometimes one officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion.: 1.6989721297840052
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--Oh!: 1.3405342622976417
how acutely did she now feel it.: 1.4901397301872537
Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing, by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr.: 1.7871203899104036
Gardiner could not but be deeply affected.: 2.176697944081312
Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr.: 2.065316229513214
Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power.--Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled.: 1.7518691533662865
They were to be off as soon as possible.: 3.8512219500271168
"But what is to be done about Pemberley?" cried Mrs.: 2.40759647677573
_That_ is all settled."  "That is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare.: 2.9585632205192787
"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth!: 2.392793273244212
Oh, that I knew how it was!"  But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour.: 1.9236227874770473
Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure.: 2.1418596940850483
An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.: 3.2291523779195273
Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.: 2.3967455715111115
"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter.: 2.300361090785372
It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best.: 2.211812442937067
Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?: 1.9793643343384362
"Upon my word," said Mrs.: 1.851076833315482
Gardiner, "I begin to be of your uncle's opinion.: 3.6874235159822306
I cannot think so very ill of Wickham.: 2.21465335806554
Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?"  "Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest.: 2.2807110100353905
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable.: 1.680192038889309
But I dare not hope it.: 2.3879238017958984
Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the case?"  "In the first place," replied Mr.: 1.9061612268840658
Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland."  "Oh!: 2.464384872288247
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption!: 1.612083011842332
And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road."  "Well, then--supposing them to be in London.: 2.280283735188707
They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose.: 1.871595407715142
It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland."  "But why all this secrecy?: 2.3346320676001158
Why any fear of detection?: 1.6467169319423132
Why must their marriage be private?: 1.37619272067593
His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her.: 2.0203254704872458
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money.: 1.5521089522229023
He cannot afford it.: 1.2540566498973518
And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?: 1.9259195544564622
But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.: 2.2299723804607754
Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter."  "But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?"  "It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt.: 2.2321823915388967
But, really, I know not what to say.: 2.6438124812657393
But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity.: 1.9073853426660066
She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater--what shall I call it?: 2.2181660340756753
susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough.: 2.0327034300564994
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman."  "But you see that Jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt."  "Of whom does Jane ever think ill?: 2.1468881330468763
And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them?: 1.92077127317182
We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word.: 2.3850946610342914
That he is as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating."  "And do you really know all this?" cried Mrs.: 2.6679236750137787
"I do, indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring.: 4.926379202472324
"I told you the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr.: 2.356706943862586
Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him.: 2.1728206329953235
From what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl.: 2.4455513935928868
Yet he knew to the contrary himself.: 1.6046439622594377
He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her."  "But does Lydia know nothing of this?: 2.5687870410470093
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?"  "Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all.: 2.112771966296783
Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr.: 2.1454948817180606
And when I returned home, the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time.: 1.8224624139729144
As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?: 2.079886212827691
And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs.: 1.8473854846987892
Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.: 2.239966640687677
That _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.: 1.5059823389156204
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away.: 2.3626979497825777
When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were.: 2.399259187641575
Every girl in, or near Meryton, was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites."         *       *       *       *       *  It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey.: 1.8551635344300803
From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.: 2.35940925140042
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.: 1.7202428360526663
They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day.: 1.9448296082706644
The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.: 2.116063251678312
Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.: 1.9848803655025713
Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives.: 2.0072940376425077
"Not yet," replied Jane.: 5.376610288025322
"But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope every thing will be well."  "Is my father in town?"  "Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word."  "And have you heard from him often?"  "We have heard only once.: 2.2617607412234917
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do.: 2.59437552536311
How are you all?"  "My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken.: 1.98753305105337
She is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all.: 1.7605481583870046
She does not yet leave her dressing-room.: 2.2066197233899953
Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven!: 2.0542065783387917
are quite well."  "But you--How are you?" cried Elizabeth.: 3.42946354281677
"You look pale.: 3.22983094233603
How much you must have gone through!"  Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr.: 2.549146441211087
Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of the whole party.: 2.2463291962733436
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.: 1.9663283914958052
The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.: 2.262913996805405
Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing.: 1.9000788691538117
"If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to Brighton, with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her.: 2.5146730010364
Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight?: 1.7755834469916751
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after.: 2.557757060951333
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am.: 2.7586296387545546
Poor dear child!: 1.2617288141078973
And now here's Mr.: 1.2777758823800003
Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.: 2.484701829629949
Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.: 2.517748785848753
"Do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.: 2.2043499316813513
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.: 2.4613717897686764
In a few days more, we may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost.: 2.259410681954077
As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be done."  "Oh!: 2.541388775731347
my dear brother," replied Mrs.: 1.6430427100082508
Bennet, "that is exactly what I could most wish for.: 2.603271944316848
And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them marry.: 2.168809996999925
And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them, after they are married.: 1.9081138359849326
Bennet from fighting.: 1.740246064451772
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,--that I am frightened out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me, such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.: 2.378326826958708
And tell my dear Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.: 2.1201184528043586
Oh, brother, how kind you are!: 1.5238938574908372
I know you will contrive it all."  But Mr.: 1.6676938603369145
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.: 2.268628198913709
One came from her books, and the other from her toilette.: 2.37708979754878
The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty.: 2.3137588005336553
As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,  "This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.: 2.0056816862250995
But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other, the balm of sisterly consolation."  Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, "Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."  Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply.: 1.8956105349725383
Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.: 2.0976278091093623
In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy.: 2.0256489548337027
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued the subject, by saying, "But tell me all and every thing about it, which I have not already heard.: 2.254046811917454
Give me farther particulars.: 1.3818130626109264
What did Colonel Forster say?: 1.4149249753637791
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place?: 1.6927372726964567
They must have seen them together for ever."  "Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm.: 2.003848622000205
I am so grieved for him.: 2.2910392188095114
He _was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey."  "And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?: 1.8954630577326959
Did he know of their intending to go off?: 1.5714279502533917
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."  "And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?"  "How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains!: 2.270371242108085
My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how imprudent a match it must be.: 1.9921009186374776
Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter, she had prepared her for such a step.: 2.6121045467736215
Does he know his real character?"  "I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did.: 2.1565029404362726
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.: 2.1056077008154235
And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said, that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false."  "Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!"  "Perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister.: 2.293696768695719
"But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.: 1.7960015058020835
We acted with the best intentions."  "Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife?"  "He brought it with him for us to see."  Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.: 1.9039776588293142
I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with      who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the      world I love, and he is an angel.: 2.3432977487508597
I should never be happy without      him, so think it no harm to be off.: 1.9357820926864322
You need not send them word at      Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the      surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia      Wickham.: 2.271167781369399
What a good joke it will be!: 2.5224669926348233
I can hardly write for      laughing.: 1.8045244402179077
Pray make my excuses to Pratt, for not keeping my      engagement, and dancing with him to-night.: 1.7272993951269524
I shall send for my      clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally      to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are      packed up.: 2.2069278492248627
Good bye.: 2.7976745721507332
Give my love to Colonel Forster, I hope you      will drink to our good journey.: 2.504899540094207
"Your affectionate friend,       "LYDIA BENNET."  "Oh!: 1.9572518720310639
thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!" cried Elizabeth when she had finished it.: 2.7168954024301044
"What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment.: 2.8973619067290315
But at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.: 2.028906880280213
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy.: 2.5551139224778265
My poor father!: 1.2859744470362877
how he must have felt it!"  "I never saw any one so shocked.: 2.5496563565469414
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes.: 2.109211305246412
My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!"  "Oh!: 2.0600489312283177
Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"  "I do not know.--I hope there was.--But to be guarded at such a time, is very difficult.: 2.5105661520376197
But the horror of what might possibly happen, almost took from me my faculties."  "Your attendance upon her, has been too much for you.: 2.0430714734060675
You do not look well.: 3.3498242142384926
that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone."  "Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.: 2.384234846187667
Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on.: 1.939491852873586
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me.: 1.9012972892341968
She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if they could be of use to us."  "She had better have stayed at home," cried Elizabeth; "perhaps she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours.: 2.2579806398134696
Assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable.: 2.842834219453236
"He meant, I believe," replied Jane, "to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could be made out from them.: 2.2193220495855646
His principal object must be, to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham.: 1.6572034770733723
It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be remarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham.: 2.219802108011699
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach.: 1.7768284805020909
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this."     CHAPTER VI.: 2.3678455812940182
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr.: 2.4863198494325918
Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.: 1.9369548555373082
His family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion.: 2.0867970955878477
They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain.: 2.1827551862348495
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.: 1.6707939168802106
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr.: 2.256270077690239
Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.: 2.602813088308845
Bennet, and was a great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom.: 2.973331199252652
Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.: 2.1152105342014242
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light.: 2.078449049989223
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.: 2.4388050749278407
Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.: 2.7400300756866023
Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street.: 2.1241967662525956
That Mr.: 1.0835054401350044
Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings.: 2.420012961656302
Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.: 2.053007619690452
He added, that Mr.: 3.1206644800069046
Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and promised to write again very soon.: 2.19454302288331
There was also a postscript to this effect.: 2.448033383242657
"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself.: 2.3216935164832204
At present we have nothing to guide us.: 1.827834840720091
Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head.: 2.2905230917379455
But, on second thoughts, perhaps Lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better than any other person."  Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved.: 1.9824309862431952
She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years.: 2.0009678126976276
It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.: 2.5430476180273938
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected.: 1.880633716105955
Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.: 2.0900330472936255
But before they heard again from Mr.: 1.319045025232312
Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.: 2.078155604976815
It was as follows:       "MY DEAR SIR,       "I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation      in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now      suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter      from Hertfordshire.: 2.0150909851403807
Collins and      myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable      family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest      kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.: 2.1425454313476764
No      arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe      a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that      must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind.: 1.9368173415439056
The death      of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.: 2.5562381719742997
And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to      suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness      of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree      of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of      yourself and Mrs.: 2.3785593979120696
Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own      disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of      such an enormity, at so early an age.: 2.5697408360046174
Howsoever that may be, you      are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined      by Mrs.: 2.5206176526962523
Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter,      to whom I have related the affair.: 2.2106586584452437
Let me advise you then, my dear Sir,      to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy      child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the      fruits of her own heinous offence.: 2.2433655956405447
"I am, dear Sir, &c.: 4.197175612100965
&c."  Mr.: 2.3550224360181837
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living.: 2.3014417486710856
His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them.: 2.346844285745221
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out, as likely to give any news of him.: 2.145266883486048
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton.: 1.614195913902782
He owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.: 1.940734420754094
Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family; Jane heard them with horror.: 2.130873457106314
"A gamester!" she cried.: 6.727417189442723
"This is wholly unexpected.: 3.6785108658988994
I had not an idea of it."  Mr.: 2.469455708646552
Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.: 2.4128684839222116
Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit.: 2.0729214467413137
When Mrs.: 1.1100384243248806
Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.: 2.1346502303190737
"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia!" she cried.: 3.0424366210418334
"Sure he will not leave London before he has found them.: 2.0186272814118174
Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?"  As Mrs.: 2.3941678444857852
Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr.: 2.7000223465853206
The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.: 2.213126239365849
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.: 2.012519316573914
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs.: 2.1868339378155786
Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.: 2.117229597316949
Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from Pemberley.: 1.8063058617349566
The present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware, that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better.: 2.2625308061977027
It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.: 2.331680181959068
Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure.: 2.565663892004026
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.: 2.262816593884949
It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "Say nothing of that.: 2.3645168663333926
Who should suffer but myself?: 1.3804495157002994
It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it."  "You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth.: 3.1968791278187316
"You may well warn me against such an evil.: 2.4169966656505366
Human nature is so prone to fall into it!: 1.5350203394339441
No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame.: 2.721051080290303
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.: 2.082806455122092
It will pass away soon enough."  "Do you suppose them to be in London?"  "Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"  "And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty.: 2.033984875043869
"She is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there will probably be of some duration."  Then, after a short silence, he continued, "Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shews some greatness of mind."  They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea.: 2.2978808386986964
"This is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune!: 2.0254904124201305
Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can,--or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away."  "I am not going to run away, Papa," said Kitty, fretfully; "if _I_ should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia."  "_You_ go to Brighton!--I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne for fifty pounds!: 2.0558447550386934
No officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the village.: 1.5537938734936871
Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.: 2.099649731523253
And you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner."  Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.: 1.9417694322391759
"Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy.: 3.118266541061117
If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them."     CHAPTER VII.: 2.205819133145457
Two days after Mr.: 1.2612808896701324
Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask."  "What do you mean, Hill?: 2.4424649231051374
We have heard nothing from town."  "Dear madam," cried Mrs.: 1.958708915220305
He has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter."  Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.: 1.8948897172556298
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said,  "If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the little copse."  Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.: 2.143747660312806
Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out,  "Oh, Papa, what news?: 2.393722029509457
what news?: 2.3639878697758205
have you heard from my uncle?"  "Yes, I have had a letter from him by express."  "Well, and what news does it bring?: 2.782297510161237
good or bad?"  "What is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it."  Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.: 2.0616212956786315
Jane now came up.: 5.7808881749495695
"Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know myself what it is about."       "Gracechurch-street, Monday,       August 2.: 2.4155829526920267
"MY DEAR BROTHER,       "At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such      as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction.: 2.288771214835757
Soon after      you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what      part of London they were.: 1.9781424851040046
The particulars, I reserve till we meet.: 1.8308283007191628
It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them      both----"  "Then it is, as I always hoped," cried Jane; "they are married!"       Elizabeth read on; "I have seen them both.: 2.3809713157271095
They are not married,      nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are      willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on      your side, I hope it will not be long before they are.: 2.264446142915737
All that is      required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her      equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your      children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,      moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your      life, one hundred pounds per annum.: 1.837360380815113
These are conditions, which,      considering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as      far as I thought myself privileged, for you.: 2.3277763286040334
I shall send this by      express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.: 1.5810882884208812
You      will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr.: 1.4886514845553633
Wickham's      circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to      be.: 1.951982193479789
If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act      in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will      immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper      settlement.: 1.956186070171403
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming      to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on      my diligence and care.: 2.1408717109370663
Send back your answer as soon as you can,      and be careful to write explicitly.: 2.0109615175557836
We have judged it best, that my      niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will      approve.: 2.1193054877505415
She comes to us to-day.: 2.0141736372080143
I shall write again as soon as any      thing more is determined on.: 2.0982957365468162
GARDINER."  "Is it possible!" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.: 3.7490819502311754
"Can it be possible that he will marry her?"  "Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her sister.: 2.25003152603238
my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately.: 2.2183129310054093
Consider how important every moment is, in such a case."  "Let me write for you," said Jane, "if you dislike the trouble yourself."  "I dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done."  And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.: 2.5715653714559172
"And may I ask?" said Elizabeth, "but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with."  "Complied with!: 2.541586140941828
I am only ashamed of his asking so little."  "And they _must_ marry!: 2.060842429779671
Yet he is _such_ a man!"  "Yes, yes, they must marry.: 2.2118499385718717
There is nothing else to be done.: 3.824682612913562
But there are two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever to pay him."  "Money!: 1.974182999012177
my uncle!" cried Jane, "what do you mean, Sir?"  "I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after I am gone."  "That is very true," said Elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me before.: 2.158285260593881
His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!: 1.4413427526709677
it must be my uncle's doings!: 2.864761903215772
Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself.: 2.297285501631151
A small sum could not do all this."  "No," said her father, "Wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds.: 2.4206981842060746
I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship."  "Ten thousand pounds!: 2.405648596952858
Heaven forbid!: 2.640133001163261
How is half such a sum to be repaid?"  Mr.: 1.3603868501283893
Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house.: 2.351680876763098
"And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves.: 3.538806689927259
"How strange this is!: 2.636388874389527
And for _this_ we are to be thankful.: 1.8680248346014174
Oh, Lydia!"  "I comfort myself with thinking," replied Jane, "that he certainly would not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her.: 2.3115202646450435
Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced.: 2.281984428541151
He has children of his own, and may have more.: 2.7946286051711176
How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?"  "If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been," said Elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr.: 1.944717403613546
Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own.: 2.4604112225984722
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited.: 2.7165877921565555
Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.: 1.6736351635130489
By this time she is actually with them!: 1.9911243745078482
What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!"  "We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said Jane: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy.: 2.0730845872145087
His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking.: 2.5568240814163867
Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten."  "Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor I, nor any body, can ever forget.: 1.9140616687409588
It is useless to talk of it."  It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.: 2.0429950544154827
They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to make it known to her.: 2.6912555354860843
He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied,  "Just as you please."  "May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"  "Take whatever you like, and get away."  Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up stairs together.: 2.1530790707680993
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs.: 1.9256001283439064
Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all.: 1.941935419669144
After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud.: 1.7309046111854471
Bennet could hardly contain herself.: 1.8047344753702113
As soon as Jane had read Mr.: 3.2490146066119583
Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance.: 2.1452056068514236
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation.: 2.175304689723067
To know that her daughter would be married was enough.: 2.408924016850856
She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.: 1.8503776511584478
"My dear, dear Lydia!" she cried: "This is delightful indeed!--She will be married!--I shall see her again!--She will be married at sixteen!--My good, kind brother!--I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage every thing.: 2.0202699912577198
How I long to see her!: 2.1117498387041964
and to see dear Wickham too!: 1.5892187275281233
But the clothes, the wedding clothes!: 1.5922391325187657
I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly.: 1.665389795742208
Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her.: 2.13009954855298
Stay, stay, I will go myself.: 2.7465620699492637
My dear, dear Lydia!--How merry we shall be together when we meet!"  Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.: 1.7140341342993732
Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.: 4.248665544022915
"For we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great measure, to his kindness.: 2.1447395811048304
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr.: 1.9035578156353994
Well!: 9.034472122119485
I am so happy.: 2.792854944376328
In a short time, I shall have a daughter married.: 2.7891988750036587
Wickham!: 8.702256617294019
How well it sounds.: 1.4776093843011204
And she was only sixteen last June.: 2.883050333172363
My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you write for me.: 2.993785437567889
We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."  She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her father was at leisure to be consulted.: 2.1164603714581216
One day's delay she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite so obstinate as usual.: 2.3151835277263273
Other schemes too came into her head.: 2.579789290615887
"I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips.: 2.6148573785087548
And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs.: 1.978283539358496
Long.: 5.468462457546313
here comes Hill.: 1.249729485551787
My dear Hill, have you heard the good news?: 2.019801049141974
Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding."  Mrs.: 2.6598967830043283
Hill began instantly to express her joy.: 1.8146407472323212
Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful.: 2.4759985886508726
She felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity, could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.: 2.0539603085088594
Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him.: 2.32147344242679
He now wished it more than ever.: 1.790221677762556
Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her.: 1.6869844865298154
When first Mr.: 1.0444095627939656
This son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for.: 2.115317939165953
Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.: 1.9831505736605823
Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he would.: 2.6096425693423804
This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving.: 1.8461792563907748
Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.: 1.9511915966180218
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.: 1.6136177645618726
Bennet and the children.: 1.7312175947874586
But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter, depended on the will of the parents.: 1.899172065762212
This was one point, with regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr.: 2.1255231500916874
Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.: 2.383512645249239
In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him.: 2.2376098116854704
He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present arrangement.: 2.0786037503386643
He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her, through her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within that sum.: 2.270911213390501
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to have as little trouble in the business as possible.: 2.1019354046191867
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.: 1.5958670172232234
His letter was soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution.: 1.9574603348476447
He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any message to her.: 1.8950718766611876
The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood.: 1.9562047628358235
It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy.: 1.637907302479946
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm house.: 2.4909403000030825
But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her misery was considered certain.: 2.0548643377249682
Bennet had been down stairs, but on this happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high.: 2.137361301107771
No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph.: 2.2028100158258668
She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.: 1.9859392067363175
"Haye-Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings would quit it, or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off!: 2.3042400497998043
I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."  Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the servants remained.: 2.1891016483449843
Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding.: 1.7568551446452882
Into _one_ house in this neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance.: 1.7808137289505637
I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn."  A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr.: 1.7969733605950666
Bennet was firm: it soon led to another; and Mrs.: 1.420211866294638
Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter.: 1.8612613045586566
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever, on the occasion.: 2.1757977758152647
Bennet could hardly comprehend it.: 1.7345016515190308
That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible.: 2.1957748415594978
She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they took place.: 2.1018130811315676
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr.: 2.189016434487014
Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the spot.: 1.7414993775413476
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much.: 2.2346958709845364
Not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them.: 2.3060453264877925
Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr.: 2.3728351909438348
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.: 2.838167220216153
The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this.: 2.316665647699989
She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.: 2.5266643379489615
She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it.: 2.22998495376618
She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.: 2.6078671015854176
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they should meet.: 2.849578698430479
What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been gladly and gratefully received!: 2.297585561021007
But while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.: 1.9751151643176186
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her.: 1.966210593039823
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was.: 1.4925445445772652
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine.: 2.2363390616765866
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.: 1.6199998976613992
Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.: 1.994694155868612
To Mr.: 1.1036130641772124
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr.: 2.302375689851592
Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia.: 2.8560388769709317
"It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon      as his marriage was fixed on.: 2.752265813446549
And I think you will agree with me,      in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both      on his account and my niece's.: 1.864500689758869
It is Mr.: 1.0352148747964613
Wickham's intention to go      into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still      some who are able and willing to assist him in the army.: 2.1090577353281517
He has the      promise of an ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in      the North.: 1.892006558557307
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of      the kingdom.: 2.258868947141661
He promises fairly, and I hope among different people,      where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be      more prudent.: 1.8697133908816865
I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of      our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the      various creditors of Mr.: 2.0797741843032562
And      will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances      to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list,      according to his information.: 1.959218169805656
They will then join his regiment,      unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from      Mrs.: 1.968401246653857
She is well, and begs to be dutifully      remembered to you and her mother.--Your's, &c.: 3.152012366989877
"E.: 1.282889025958353
GARDINER."  Mr.: 1.0392813372597838
Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr.: 1.8946184089722589
Bennet, was not so well pleased with it.: 4.038569906546812
"She is so fond of Mrs.: 2.65625539445427
The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----'s regiment."  His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again, before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative.: 1.8643562329365175
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to the North.: 2.340210732642908
Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn.: 2.441719201035699
Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.: 2.5477062849751677
The carriage was sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time.: 2.402766134702447
They came.: 1.7253057540636958
The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive them.: 2.171988718940847
Smiles decked the face of Mrs.: 1.756096306106313
Bennet, as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.: 1.9123611542782961
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room.: 2.420352875250138
Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.: 1.9920279603462487
Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial.: 2.7116486359061818
His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips.: 2.1431759438875115
The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him.: 2.340001402644891
Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless.: 2.1627119586240453
She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.: 2.428386131568701
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.: 2.0021453663480044
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man.: 1.9078313274913399
_She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.: 1.8090846273636763
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.: 1.9016251819710235
Good gracious!: 1.801074890387973
when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again!: 2.4838467266669704
though I thought it would be very good fun if I was."  Her father lifted up his eyes.: 2.0873857971681216
Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "Oh!: 2.062323074777177
mamma, do the people here abouts know I am married to-day?: 1.849360963652853
I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like any thing."  Elizabeth could bear it no longer.: 2.090800935333064
She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour.: 2.176537355966185
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, "Ah!: 1.9225980094559034
Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman."  It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment, from which she had been so wholly free at first.: 2.317113169917239
Her ease and good spirits increased.: 1.749644707223172
She longed to see Mrs.: 2.298498112804295
Philips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs.: 2.2787629577510753
Wickham," by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married, to Mrs.: 2.1087319487081637
Hill and the two housemaids.: 2.6788165571001645
I am sure my sisters must all envy me.: 2.2292823403260016
I only hope they may have half my good luck.: 1.7516588668518642
They must all go to Brighton.: 1.8155541064769016
What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."  "Very true; and if I had my will, we should.: 2.191311962685837
Must it be so?"  "Oh, lord!: 2.1870620388108
yes;--there is nothing in that.: 2.4683919831732517
I shall like it of all things.: 1.8194748747379879
You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.: 1.78110728369934
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all."  "I should like it beyond any thing!" said her mother.: 2.65381415216689
"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over."  "I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands."  Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.: 2.1555086238812
Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.: 2.427276412942383
No one but Mrs.: 2.226922545798058
Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.: 2.1193082834509296
These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.: 1.6560726802284587
Wickham's affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him.: 2.5401388270976026
She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.: 2.2599169549816223
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him.: 1.5496379376309672
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.: 1.818479171492373
He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country.: 2.470683848325994
One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,  "Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe.: 2.5520162079377506
You were not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it.: 2.6075392313531536
You are so strange!: 2.081969153834275
But I must tell you how it went off.: 1.9993344604151344
We were married, you know, at St.: 2.2368185106453558
Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish.: 2.8292689626154015
And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock.: 2.1839713542520256
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church.: 2.7249639378636865
Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss!: 3.760692905227893
I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.: 2.389677169316398
And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon.: 1.8461186305792858
However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham.: 2.47932045433674
I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.: 2.5677933278492393
"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them.: 2.356608380942772
If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight.: 2.141220762489296
Not one party, or scheme, or any thing.: 1.890284650669831
Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr.: 2.1610962069941886
Stone.: 2.540655015623979
Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day.: 2.7010634185664477
But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.: 2.194316019166935
Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.: 1.6944803925154475
But gracious me!: 1.279612140445351
I quite forgot!: 1.237417936962858
I ought not to have said a word about it.: 2.0053961884212623
It was to be such a secret!"  "If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the subject.: 2.5341070584444765
You may depend upon my seeking no further."  "Oh!: 1.5550648223899672
certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will ask you no questions."  "Thank you," said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry."  On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.: 2.2934940183122956
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information.: 1.9938847060741867
Darcy had been at her sister's wedding.: 3.529755729513123
It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.: 1.7574703613075806
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none.: 2.453804422074359
Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.: 1.9147640089550482
She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.: 2.1020763407023235
"You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time.: 2.207456467069219
CHAPTER X.: 1.046627341480735
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as soon as she possibly could.: 2.1586006135745897
She was no sooner in possession of it, than hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.: 2.6497437936856256
"Gracechurch-street, Sept.: 2.1765375050277593
6.: 1.2168416092013268
I must confess myself      surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.: 1.9661510572517114
Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,      that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_      side.: 2.2901619024015747
If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my      impertinence.: 1.960084672801906
But if you are really innocent and      ignorant, I must be more explicit.: 2.3573650934582067
On the very day of my coming      home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.: 2.0446070845044866
Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.: 2.2933297633055227
It was all      over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked      as _your's_ seems to have been.: 1.8391210105363487
He came to tell Mr.: 2.50986825063848
Gardiner that      he had found out where your sister and Mr.: 2.0876168285511127
Wickham were, and that      he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia      once.: 2.2548672743099
From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day      after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting      for them.: 1.655181667845927
The motive professed, was his conviction of its being      owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well      known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,      to love or confide in him.: 2.27332200037821
He generously imputed the whole to his      mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath      him, to lay his private actions open to the world.: 1.842443602114074
His character      was to speak for itself.: 1.8932116093078173
He called it, therefore, his duty to step      forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on      by himself.: 1.9705785394612976
If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never      disgrace him.: 2.3931306583803025
He had been some days in town, before he was able to      discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was      more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another      reason for his resolving to follow us.: 2.7860584456660247
There is a lady, it seems, a      Mrs.: 2.154292019894051
Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was      dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though      he did not say what.: 2.5248069627006515
She then took a large house in Edward-street,      and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.: 1.8336873770448117
This Mrs.: 1.1100384243248806
Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he      went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town.: 2.5203253843735056
But      it was two or three days before he could get from her what he      wanted.: 2.383898848237773
She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery      and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be      found.: 3.096144009365105
Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in      London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they      would have taken up their abode with her.: 2.4048020250651905
At length, however, our      kind friend procured the wished-for direction.: 1.9162071332684403
They were in ----      street.: 1.962871757127123
He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.: 2.0773434796376367
But he found Lydia      absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.: 1.643358440937543
She was sure they should be married some time or      other, and it did not much signify when.: 2.7226873784975503
Since such were her      feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a      marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he      easily learnt, had never been _his_ design.: 2.1083437380644345
He confessed himself      obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,      which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the      ill-consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone.: 1.9744450321002753
He      meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future      situation, he could conjecture very little about it.: 2.407429391456749
He must go      somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have      nothing to live on.: 2.8892482370398023
Darcy asked him why he had not married your      sister at once.: 1.9963162254779687
Bennet was not imagined to be very rich,      he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation      must have been benefited by marriage.: 2.9248572352792004
But he found, in reply to      this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more      effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.: 1.933115942122868
Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof      against the temptation of immediate relief.: 2.5274786902803674
They met several times,      for there was much to be discussed.: 2.050724229519722
Wickham of course wanted more      than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.: 1.7630052775393983
Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr.: 1.333043171963411
Darcy's next step was      to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in      Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home.: 2.35162281178754
But Mr.: 1.0561351882847272
Gardiner      could not be seen, and Mr.: 2.8233916845055615
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could      so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed      seeing him, till after the departure of the former.: 1.9846839360077446
He did not      leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a      gentleman had called on business.: 2.4835710113518497
On Saturday he came again.: 1.513585308551968
Your      father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they      had a great deal of talk together.: 2.80599671061184
They met again on Sunday, and      then _I_ saw him too.: 2.035310637378574
It was not all settled before Monday: as soon      as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn.: 2.2585208134237784
But our visitor      was very obstinate.: 1.3806056160197375
He has been accused of many      faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one.: 1.8888240124547986
They battled it      together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman      or lady concerned in it deserved.: 1.8669310174833516
But at last your uncle was forced      to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,      was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,      which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your      letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an      explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give      the praise where it was due.: 2.22665343188716
But, Lizzy, this must go no farther      than yourself, or Jane at most.: 1.941718699744885
You know pretty well, I suppose,      what has been done for the young people.: 2.6526906154066014
His debts are to be paid,      amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,      another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his      commission purchased.: 2.3689481284868132
It was owing to him, to his      reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character      had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been      received and noticed as he was.: 2.4090308986269013
But in spite of all this      fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that      your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit      for _another interest_ in the affair.: 2.348893966192406
When all this was resolved      on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at      Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more      when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to      receive the last finish.: 2.2278532294638467
I believe I have now told you every thing.: 1.9855107570189525
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I      hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.: 2.1127904261790045
Lydia came to      us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house.: 2.3502729259483637
_He_ was      exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I      would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour      while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter      last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a      piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no      fresh pain.: 2.443954912267909
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,      representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and      all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.: 2.214854016197371
If she heard me,      it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen.: 2.9522895025880675
I was      sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth      and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.: 1.8815251742334813
Darcy was      punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the      wedding.: 1.9054159491883649
He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again      on Wednesday or Thursday.: 2.203748926082916
Will you be very angry with me, my dear      Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold      enough to say before) how much I like him.: 2.1987617772460486
His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but      a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his      wife may teach him.: 1.782136382814806
I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever      mentioned your name.: 1.4664615934025809
But slyness seems the fashion.: 1.2552462765436472
Pray forgive      me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so      far, as to exclude me from P.: 2.8395510623061653
I shall never be quite happy till I      have been all round the park.: 2.3257215328035254
A low phaeton, with a nice little      pair of ponies, would be the very thing.: 2.153926598395507
But I must write no more.: 2.171385937781172
The children have been wanting me this half hour.: 1.535200942453197
Your's, very      sincerely,       "M.: 2.3896516338441396
GARDINER."  The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share.: 1.8481553537143713
The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr.: 1.44187670043418
Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!: 1.9785953415060011
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.: 2.022025778276032
Her heart did whisper, that he had done it for her.: 2.595407674480673
But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham.: 2.091131666436423
Brother-in-law of Wickham!: 1.9445105939754
Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection.: 2.2750439863851093
He had to be sure done much.: 2.597145786910528
She was ashamed to think how much.: 1.8290791646764077
But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief.: 1.7929659354296237
It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return.: 1.9516213485254252
They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing to him.: 2.124188628153956
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him.: 1.6655682042499018
For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.: 2.1499659505947433
She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again.: 2.0558944508999795
Darcy and herself.: 2.5069991271807384
"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said he, as he joined her.: 3.2389533900608685
"You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome."  "I should be sorry indeed, if it were.: 2.511813147524426
_We_ were always good friends; and now we are better."  "True.: 2.1023693228335647
And so, my dear sister, I find from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley."  She replied in the affirmative.: 2.6316302300924335
"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.: 2.304537286736017
And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?: 2.410345716535673
But of course she did not mention my name to you."  "Yes, she did."  "And what did she say?"  "That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned out well.: 2.7387071059815624
At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely misrepresented."  "Certainly," he replied, biting his lips.: 2.2570032586085214
I wonder what he can be doing there."  "Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said Elizabeth.: 2.39739001041256
"It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year."  "Undoubtedly.: 1.9375398962947585
I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had."  "Yes; he introduced us to his sister."  "And do you like her?"  "Very much."  "I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two.: 2.527477017014224
When I last saw her, she was not very promising.: 2.9919435440798234
I am very glad you liked her.: 2.098800637432119
I hope she will turn out well."  "I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."  "Did you go by the village of Kympton?"  "I do not recollect that we did."  "I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had.: 2.3901177264441795
A most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House!: 1.506595338335564
It would have suited me in every respect."  "How should you have liked making sermons?"  "Exceedingly well.: 1.94120463383209
I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing.: 2.5086358973497958
One ought not to repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me!: 2.952095264798016
The quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of happiness!: 1.9657020135046415
But it was not to be.: 5.542054821094189
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?"  "I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."  "You have.: 2.4443291975247217
and it was not wholly without foundation.: 3.7358964172122695
You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it."  They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,  "Come, Mr.: 2.3833034581553725
Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.: 2.3595242821838713
Do not let us quarrel about the past.: 1.7747115310844608
In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind."  She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.: 2.3109482342117187
CHAPTER XI.: 1.046627341480735
Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.: 2.2911386989518254
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs.: 2.1624369994777903
Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.: 2.115783493279678
my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"  "Oh, lord!: 2.250923533681099
Not these two or three years perhaps."  "Write to me very often, my dear."  "As often as I can.: 2.175440345831013
My sisters may write to _me_.: 1.3662825105108385
They will have nothing else to do."  Mr.: 1.8710424998132107
Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's.: 2.1391895336431372
He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.: 2.9115857723290017
"He is as fine a fellow," said Mr.: 2.1799230685771955
Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, "as ever I saw.: 3.2202437459144697
He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all.: 3.718506898891326
I am prodigiously proud of him.: 1.3979468435278004
I defy even Sir William Lucas himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law."  The loss of her daughter made Mrs.: 1.8981579049600743
Bennet very dull for several days.: 2.868817698690072
"I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends.: 2.431706182235174
One seems so forlorn without them."  "This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said Elizabeth.: 2.4613560875144627
"It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single."  "It is no such thing.: 2.0285839006107524
If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."  But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news, which then began to be in circulation.: 1.9749945268243114
Bennet was quite in the fidgets.: 3.0725673362630146
"Well, well, and so Mr.: 4.528636501068848
Philips first brought her the news.) "Well, so much the better.: 1.865635367240926
He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure _I_ never want to see him again.: 2.996569348309955
But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it.: 3.1860834327678247
And who knows what _may_ happen?: 1.4234439590673615
But that is nothing to us.: 3.1808689713014306
You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it.: 1.867977528490387
And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"  "You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs.: 2.281069802803516
Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.: 2.2558436790078993
He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday.: 2.1134567368429447
She was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be killed."  Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing colour.: 2.5722896710677654
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,  "I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed.: 2.3534120114890205
But don't imagine it was from any silly cause.: 1.6009327536646323
I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I _should_ be looked at.: 2.35464481659948
I do assure you, that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain.: 2.152566256456189
Not that I am afraid of _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks."  Elizabeth did not know what to make of it.: 3.102751868921846
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it.: 2.396559144499064
"Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation!: 1.9910234573154004
They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.: 1.8411277101635688
Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs.: 2.52194398173019
You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.: 2.116878931307797
But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again."  His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.: 2.210366514618836
"'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he.: 2.4686862081464294
"If he wants our society, let him seek it.: 2.0717487018157543
He knows where we live.: 1.4925165321532188
I will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back again."  "Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him.: 2.3133972121718047
But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined.: 2.363014611295687
We must have Mrs.: 1.3992181907644412
Long and the Gouldings soon.: 1.4965819352798464
That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him."  Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr.: 1.9630690085769364
As the day of his arrival drew near,  "I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her sister.: 2.61910835827359
"It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.: 2.7285511517976353
My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know how much I suffer from what she says.: 2.4985484698501503
Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!"  "I wish I could say any thing to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but it is wholly out of my power.: 2.2566952918906877
You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much."  Mr.: 2.193516272492332
Bingley arrived.: 1.6678413252166953
Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could.: 2.2655186479859704
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.: 2.1007790193360565
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.: 1.4195990036016577
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr.: 2.0568513076929498
Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.: 3.0502331839667116
what's his name.: 1.603160734268241
That tall, proud man."  "Good gracious!: 1.7401701442254376
Darcy!--and so it does I vow.: 1.6530991420391679
Well, any friend of Mr.: 1.384506495903103
Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him."  Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.: 1.9985144264888783
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter.: 2.0242376159905726
Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr.: 2.5947877447273577
Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr.: 2.672151240903854
Bingley's friend, without being heard by either of them.: 2.5538257934382265
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.: 2.4153324115231123
Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.: 2.436990486908007
Her astonishment at his coming--at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.: 2.061289899299113
The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken.: 2.17958713633751
But she would not be secure.: 7.546450737574325
"Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early enough for expectation."  She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister, as the servant was approaching the door.: 2.069648195083858
Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected.: 2.42819556977768
On the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.: 1.821028276466974
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.: 1.9451081628981826
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.: 1.4367875942598245
But, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.: 2.669179979238644
It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.: 2.2925623137492344
He was received by Mrs.: 1.3881989912982384
Bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.: 1.8206639948816508
Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr.: 1.7453076224332562
Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.: 2.087804168627379
He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.: 2.4483217138005102
There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself.: 2.6797672902495693
But now several minutes elapsed, without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane, as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground.: 1.7572402629770276
She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.: 2.0617612931109877
"Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said she.: 3.819511733725012
"Yet why did he come?"  She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.: 2.2004375930574422
She enquired after his sister, but could do no more.: 2.8479853600249334
"It is a long time, Mr.: 3.1326378173675793
Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs.: 1.6266263565004038
He readily agreed to it.: 3.3517577967307814
"I began to be afraid you would never come back again.: 2.071549688788158
People _did_ say, you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true.: 2.559989751519288
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away.: 1.909860456573471
Miss Lucas is married and settled.: 1.2744182471761378
And one of my own daughters.: 3.615198491437779
It was in the Times and the Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be.: 3.2283524893430315
It was only said, 'Lately, George Wickham, Esq.: 1.976518123594778
to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.: 2.180594414499611
It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it.: 2.212857250524772
Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes.: 1.6724727556798598
How Mr.: 1.092946854771403
Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.: 5.161678562981053
"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married," continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr.: 3.0284684718577877
They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not know how long.: 2.1269708036332236
His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.: 2.434972366732132
Thank Heaven!: 1.3554229510537894
he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves."  Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr.: 2.0793134145650987
Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.: 2.666923853170398
It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present.: 2.3417081116485483
A few weeks, he believed.: 4.346559798712108
"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr.: 1.98219088894739
Bingley," said her mother, "I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr.: 3.0818208058033525
Bennet's manor.: 6.598556697349801
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.: 2.4358735922021215
At that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for moments of such painful confusion.: 1.9321063857661647
"The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be in company with either of them.: 2.885224095642079
When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.: 2.0059659601572903
He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty.: 2.456744005762288
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever.: 2.1721039254399113
But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.: 2.5034019174839983
When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs.: 1.9984348572519985
Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time.: 2.7884309916040078
Bingley," she added, "for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned.: 2.385070546376091
I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement."  Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern, at having been prevented by business.: 2.2609638982424736
They then went away.: 1.8311112248290797
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year.: 2.048399520649065
CHAPTER XII.: 1.046627341480735
As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more.: 1.9991091703607975
"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she, "did he come at all?"  She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.: 2.251753156582516
"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?: 2.3952650154622392
If he no longer cares for me, why silent?: 1.9168241643648498
Teazing, teazing, man!: 1.3209057087025449
I will think no more about him."  Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.: 2.0879298663873773
"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy.: 2.234411535625312
I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming.: 2.3729255822965825
I am glad he dines here on Tuesday.: 1.9875006598354457
It will then be publicly seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance."  "Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly.: 2.2306060487237676
"Oh, Jane, take care."  "My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now."  "I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever."         *       *       *       *       *  They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs.: 2.411713305616218
Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived.: 2.3216489939739717
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two, who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time.: 2.7025761734842053
When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.: 2.195456528808112
Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself.: 1.8909569852006438
On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided.: 1.9053496317179215
He placed himself by her.: 1.829612873108593
Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.: 1.9951145076661476
He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr.: 2.4357491115828136
Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.: 2.3995458781492527
His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured.: 2.5168239298990325
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour.: 2.059386737663187
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage.: 1.683409633410872
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner, whenever they did.: 2.18276419563638
Her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.: 2.4621100836224543
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.: 1.9594579691555698
Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her uncivil.: 1.8747714847062873
She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.: 2.3631392138030427
"If he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "I shall give him up for ever."  The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas!: 2.9190635075267597
And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,  "The men shan't come and part us, I am determined.: 2.5754488230846064
We want none of them; do we?"  Darcy had walked away to another part of the room.: 1.947297022678658
She followed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!: 2.173137135812881
"A man who has once been refused!: 2.654826219274217
How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love?: 1.8326419063347335
Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?: 1.7688087310936176
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"  She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,  "Is your sister at Pemberley still?"  "Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."  "And quite alone?: 2.468883203405919
Have all her friends left her?"  "Mrs.: 2.0268554694672005
Annesley is with her.: 1.5068103764634964
The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks."  She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success.: 2.262176495040527
He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.: 2.8132269446796117
When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party.: 2.3923130692772903
She now lost every expectation of pleasure.: 1.7045353891354618
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.: 2.664143576696983
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.: 2.3289930426322463
"Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "What say you to the day?: 2.4500504639947316
The venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat a haunch.: 2.297249138601698
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas's last week; and even Mr.: 1.8528804263447454
Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not.: 1.9315935877377473
Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.' She did indeed.: 1.907783935212448
I do think Mrs.: 1.9460218496611719
Long is as good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously."  Mrs.: 1.9857931575543823
Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.: 2.605274578475526
"It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth.: 3.1737757376195908
"The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.: 1.705017414801325
I hope we may often meet again."  Elizabeth smiled.: 2.4523519726088434
"Lizzy, you must not do so.: 4.850999235333854
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.: 1.9772774765616083
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection.: 2.0037766963832278
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man."  "You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment."  "How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"  "And how impossible in others!"  "But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?"  "That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.: 2.189639231832433
We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.: 2.160277647792234
Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your confidante."     CHAPTER XIII.: 2.355811311284514
A few days after this visit, Mr.: 1.86943255967614
Bingley called again, and alone.: 2.872911161415683
His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time.: 1.7958591579252905
He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits.: 2.3716775949791895
Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.: 2.3368263190289635
"Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky."  He should be particularly happy at any time, &c.: 2.215052736035113
&c.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.: 2.036861304761669
"Can you come to-morrow?"  Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.: 2.498908101283697
He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them dressed.: 2.923627153530209
In ran Mrs.: 1.0521499623212256
He is come--Mr.: 1.5701528473556776
Bingley is come.--He is, indeed.: 2.145919476994736
Make haste, make haste.: 2.5822629576547573
Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair."  "We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago."  "Oh!: 2.406734277970931
hang Kitty!: 3.164610015289422
what has she to do with it?: 1.7621513103967974
Come be quick, be quick!: 1.5471636100233819
where is your sash my dear?"  But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.: 2.3558904542040366
The same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the evening.: 1.959215438733516
After tea, Mr.: 1.2635218238452792
Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument.: 1.93530966231654
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs.: 1.478900060626868
Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them.: 1.6136835244364005
What do you keep winking at me for?: 1.9678307561016917
What am I to do?"  "Nothing child, nothing.: 1.9419905837184939
I did not wink at you." She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,  "Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room.: 2.130548077582734
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it.: 2.1955261650492544
In a few minutes, Mrs.: 3.4220562951322058
"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother as soon as she was in the hall.: 3.003514631982554
"Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room."  Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.: 2.083851560321743
Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.: 2.470080590397789
Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.: 1.814245343282228
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.: 1.9392191377833572
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.: 1.7977720010918015
After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.: 2.2541058146399893
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr.: 1.781737664009198
Darcy returned within the stated time.: 1.343605004252805
Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence.: 2.2072285148736146
Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on.: 1.8892021573891251
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected.: 1.61234552514884
There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him.: 2.189854839777438
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs.: 2.9609298089507434
Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter.: 2.309790876358313
Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.: 2.4234095310811457
But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her.: 2.3846430698559216
On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would have told it all.: 2.056360202449983
_Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she thought was still worse.: 1.702245613372453
Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.: 2.2477778294022324
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.: 2.281469233451961
"'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much.: 2.13481978797984
I do not deserve it.: 3.7931318278955852
why is not every body as happy?"  Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.: 1.674907002888575
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.: 1.611502049516918
But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said, for the present.: 2.946239302994489
"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried.: 3.119914106082322
"I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself.: 1.9710869346538549
He is gone to my father already.: 2.41636457748066
Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family!: 2.1511839034813804
how shall I bear so much happiness!"  She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.: 2.0620610961007633
Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.: 1.9340928688702417
"And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection!: 2.834478492234246
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance!: 2.443084323593879
the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"  In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.: 2.051283039842687
"Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door.: 3.021309614019472
"With my mother up stairs.: 2.2139156337302826
She will be down in a moment I dare say."  He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister.: 2.442773486192496
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship.: 1.715307269020024
They shook hands with great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.: 2.43046112208137
Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.: 1.6148178969387177
Bennet could not give her consent, or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when Mr.: 2.135206081767204
Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was.: 1.5378942031173441
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter and said,  "Jane, I congratulate you.: 2.538600223162854
"You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled.: 2.861577623283474
Your tempers are by no means unlike.: 2.2029064501755675
You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income."  "I hope not so.: 2.1082395738377646
Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be unpardonable in _me_."  "Exceed their income!: 1.6413779519254965
Bennet," cried his wife, "what are you talking of?: 2.5373043924842054
Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely more." Then addressing her daughter, "Oh!: 2.0448914350513534
my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy!: 4.18714336562666
I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night.: 1.8856383177285079
I knew how it would be.: 2.9174637175008864
I always said it must be so, at last.: 2.359592557348461
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing!: 2.6468828718696797
I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together.: 2.2692612714204743
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!"  Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.: 1.9396762564586478
Jane was beyond competition her favourite child.: 1.453053942099283
At that moment, she cared for no other.: 2.039592900379466
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.: 1.861300648283268
Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought himself obliged to accept.: 2.122015251175181
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur.: 2.046206204857328
In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.: 2.6802067584520066
"He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!: 2.532283988515239
I had not believed it possible."  "I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth.: 2.8825647569606003
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.: 2.128935848415056
But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other."  "That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever heard you utter.: 2.2756657418109976
It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard."  "Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!"  "He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty."  This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities.: 2.282177730224678
Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.: 2.4956426776800407
"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried Jane.: 2.0674732422726905
Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all!: 1.7280982770382463
If I could but see _you_ as happy!: 1.8264718688830337
Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness.: 2.0807945404792183
No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr.: 2.4523518608334154
Collins in time."  The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret.: 2.163815909121716
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs.: 1.3685055229387346
Philips, and _she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.: 1.8675992432494322
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.: 2.194291785381453
CHAPTER XIV.: 1.046627341480735
It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.: 2.2924411462400203
As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery.: 2.280093289059965
They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open, and their visitor entered.: 2.0328838668893363
They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.: 1.9986130834704077
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.: 2.2223481436875767
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.: 2.0152438641683506
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.: 2.1897951051753117
After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,  "I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.: 3.0047405790450683
"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters."  "Yes, madam," said Mrs.: 2.627053355725343
Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine.: 2.921796331147711
"She is my youngest girl but one.: 2.573137386021179
My youngest of all, is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man, who I believe will soon become a part of the family."  "You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short silence.: 2.244642695675283
"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's."  "This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west."  Mrs.: 2.3577579422922805
Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then added,  "May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr.: 2.1174891855720293
Collins well."  "Yes, very well.: 3.1494063923922035
I saw them the night before last."  Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.: 1.8299935865149537
But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.: 2.389117562562894
Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,  "Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn.: 2.2750164949166094
I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company."  "Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the different walks.: 2.6128471582061503
I think she will be pleased with the hermitage."  Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest down stairs.: 2.2509761476095336
As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.: 2.5013735917379023
Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it.: 2.406361795001827
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.: 1.9534168385316806
"How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in her face.: 2.564901415300573
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner:--  "You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither.: 2.4378424287010554
"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.: 3.8987000858889456
I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here."  "Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with.: 3.153266647521594
But however insincere _you_ may choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so.: 1.862365301296291
A report of a most alarming nature, reached me two days ago.: 1.6473823511334513
Though I _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you."  "If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far.: 2.2848339319219266
What could your ladyship propose by it?"  "At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."  "Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth, coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence."  "If!: 2.276279435041831
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?: 2.05047093819012
Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves?: 2.2481440377339776
Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?"  "I never heard that it was."  "And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?"  "I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.: 2.5348409059139945
_You_ may ask questions, which _I_ shall not choose to answer."  "This is not to be borne.: 2.132737730469071
Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied.: 2.47888482477947
Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"  "Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."  "It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason.: 2.24110916455763
But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.: 2.315724739589958
You may have drawn him in."  "If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it."  "Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?: 2.861929584042635
I have not been accustomed to such language as this.: 2.021460438932435
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."  "But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit."  "Let me be rightly understood.: 1.9936776188465466
No, never.: 1.624708911602854
Darcy is engaged to _my daughter_.: 1.8669643845285242
Now what have you to say?"  "Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me."  Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,  "The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.: 2.274076912101529
From their infancy, they have been intended for each other.: 2.3409983189502794
It was the favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of her's.: 2.209693372113414
While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family!: 2.430637318377322
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?: 2.028211864429933
To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh?: 2.3446078846562073
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy?: 1.7636869050502186
Have you not heard me say, that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"  "Yes, and I had heard it before.: 1.983934550336985
But what is that to me?: 2.562578063847157
If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh.: 2.101700627388812
You both did as much as you could, in planning the marriage.: 2.450918904018426
Its completion depended on others.: 1.3783839898692312
If Mr.: 1.092946854771403
And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"  "Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.: 1.7169494978070867
You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him.: 1.8607452068108716
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us."  "These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth.: 2.025316356649531
"But the wife of Mr.: 2.751113888772442
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine."  "Obstinate, headstrong girl!: 1.8447091493287304
I am ashamed of you!: 1.5585466593243051
Is nothing due to me on that score?: 2.738195172893326
"Let us sit down.: 3.3940156693418255
You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it.: 2.069581494563926
I have not been used to submit to any person's whims.: 2.4543691160388184
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."  "_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on _me_."  "I will not be interrupted.: 2.6227545352783834
They are descended on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancient, though untitled families.: 2.7207518441429612
Their fortune on both sides is splendid.: 1.5168148102652879
They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?: 2.1747131106703756
The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune.: 1.8109368596293112
Is this to be endured!: 1.8932518635603428
But it must not, shall not be.: 2.487067945011757
If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere, in which you have been brought up."  "In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere.: 2.367689078286467
You _are_ a gentleman's daughter.: 1.8099759294852782
But who was your mother?: 1.6281445162850465
Who are your uncles and aunts?: 1.3928135704850166
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman.: 1.8833693793033595
I shall not go away, till you have given me the assurance I require."  "And I certainly _never_ shall give it.: 2.2339626916395043
I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.: 2.837700719133318
Your ladyship wants Mr.: 1.1445582308178253
Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make _their_ marriage at all more probable?: 1.5540274890642394
Supposing him to be attached to me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?: 1.9015285002573943
Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged.: 2.3887107624835684
You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.: 1.9489112189693547
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine.: 1.6635668287374772
I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject."  "Not so hasty, if you please.: 2.8761097434180414
I have by no means done.: 2.3511821689517944
To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add.: 2.3207918998625092
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement.: 2.0317915650091365
I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.: 2.3662668950054924
And is _such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister?: 1.9226521647182884
Heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking?: 2.9691202224012643
"You have insulted me, in every possible method.: 3.7366201900514837
I must beg to return to the house."  And she rose as she spoke.: 2.331324191044249
Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back.: 2.497697025750023
Her ladyship was highly incensed.: 4.844402628679914
"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!: 3.036601895301609
Unfeeling, selfish girl!: 1.258705993208288
Do you not consider that a connection with you, must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"  "Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say.: 2.4609564353018687
You know my sentiments."  "You are then resolved to have him?"  "I have said no such thing.: 2.528902595125857
I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."  "It is well.: 2.223620041930969
You refuse, then, to oblige me.: 2.167245803585053
You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.: 1.8264633636733183
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."  "Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any possible claim on me, in the present instance.: 2.308561130520385
No principle of either, would be violated by my marriage with Mr.: 2.360077936741844
And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn."  "And this is your real opinion!: 2.4343829026745807
This is your final resolve!: 3.264394123843353
Very well.: 3.9728182611459246
I shall now know how to act.: 1.9324539825046074
Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.: 2.8148705549523454
I came to try you.: 1.909530261182181
I hoped to find you reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point."  In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,  "I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.: 2.1513647794372313
I send no compliments to your mother.: 1.7362419766381985
You deserve no such attention.: 1.417678745698919
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.: 1.4712720342746366
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.: 2.0785720083503016
"She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."  "She is a very fine-looking woman!: 2.8968587173296925
and her calling here was prodigiously civil!: 1.3488854006858861
for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.: 2.0539860091086677
The discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.: 1.9805802039431313
Lady Catherine it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.: 1.781814441130978
It was a rational scheme to be sure!: 3.2100706616424395
but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply the idea.: 1.9020061828490311
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.: 2.062371917487752
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked forward to as possible, at some future time.: 1.7030297990852519
In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference.: 2.5157568942270387
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce.: 2.0344980179708974
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side.: 2.105668585078326
With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.: 1.700548922406805
If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity unblemished could make him.: 2.0958081543481475
In that case he would return no more.: 1.7112714161544207
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.: 2.006654996821452
I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy.: 2.0161349570864746
The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.: 2.6767728529825856
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.: 2.5533402246065315
She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.: 2.536144111531232
He then said,  "I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly.: 2.3294700341750065
I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony.: 2.6221242576208534
Let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest."  The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued,  "You look conscious.: 2.1281853152535377
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer.: 2.0602176359042814
and what can _he_ have to say?"  "Something very much to the purpose of course.: 2.2036911056961395
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases.: 1.9695168618430599
I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point.: 1.8622736087951826
What relates to yourself, is as follows.: 1.857052931346633
"Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs.: 1.3396876646350075
Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another: of which we have been advertised by the same authority.: 2.2966389889997734
Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate, may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious personages in this land."  "Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?" "This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage.: 2.0513954995439763
Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of."  "Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?: 2.2271173288843245
But now it comes out."  "My motive for cautioning you, is as follows.: 2.0277193865032417
We have reason to imagine that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye."  "_Mr.: 2.0053441743498444
Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_ surprised you.: 3.1354657992647987
Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related?: 1.9461998896676949
Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life!: 2.4660208471396614
It is admirable!"  Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile.: 2.360270099585926
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.: 2.1498120302936545
"Are you not diverted?"  "Oh!: 2.5204859332107525
Pray read on."  "After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.: 1.922604314265594
I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned." "Mr.: 2.020042632669691
Collins moreover adds," "I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally known.: 1.987328869219695
It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it.: 1.8739579702550404
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing." "_That_ is his notion of christian forgiveness!: 1.5456734091962443
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch.: 2.535484586635896
You are not going to be _Missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.: 2.874719937109997
For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?"  "Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted.: 2.2688375015002387
But it is so strange!"  "Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing.: 1.967139374612978
Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_ pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!: 1.930603367827377
Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr.: 2.5711817091565257
Collins's correspondence for any consideration.: 2.46080609433027
Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law.: 2.0814735706523484
And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report?: 2.103606449292722
Did she call to refuse her consent?"  To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it.: 1.9642742594303242
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.: 2.566559060115135
Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr.: 1.7999891385266868
Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.: 2.3208250816394953
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr.: 1.6361544619889468
Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's visit.: 2.3762656529013446
Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out.: 1.9246641573669734
Bennet was not in the habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five set off together.: 2.2389087117050543
Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them.: 2.5652368423619096
They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy, were to entertain each other.: 2.070226182318877
Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.: 1.7814982287490564
They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone.: 1.9711327316340095
Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said,  "Mr.: 2.647214988535105
Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's.: 2.4020193688225397
I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister.: 1.6105539220570748
Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it.: 2.4944620680779064
Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express."  "I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.: 2.4381942486945682
I did not think Mrs.: 4.215006458948798
Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them."  "If you _will_ thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone.: 2.2350831441724943
That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny.: 2.0754914224740055
But your _family_ owe me nothing.: 1.3912631519456256
Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought only of _you_."  Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.: 2.1772418047331055
If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.: 1.8674109489208655
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.: 2.406396124746143
They walked on, without knowing in what direction.: 2.206217801709177
She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give.: 2.034002495532904
But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.: 2.284584634376795
"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before.: 2.1827671919486455
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly."  Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_.: 2.1931030120934016
After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations."  "What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?: 2.345121021020865
For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof.: 1.7560458882988281
It was unpardonable.: 12.892165467204961
"The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility."  "I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.: 2.3017792191666118
The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.: 2.3141631231339206
Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner.' Those were your words.: 1.7351105156205795
You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did.: 2.2891434394714074
The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way, that would induce you to accept me."  "Oh!: 2.0325097519606836
do not repeat what I then said.: 1.645768000996728
These recollections will not do at all.: 1.9330143889361617
I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it."  Darcy mentioned his letter.: 2.9308822793262865
"Did it," said he, "did it _soon_ make you think better of me?: 2.5045106574877183
Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?"  She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed.: 1.9177944914829421
"I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary.: 2.664380797397338
I hope you have destroyed the letter.: 2.27674023156359
There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again.: 2.1110206567761884
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me."  "The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies."  "When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit."  "The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.: 2.3111437194302527
The adieu is charity itself.: 1.423139156361685
But think no more of the letter.: 3.079402406984633
The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten.: 2.15347537909218
You must learn some of my philosophy.: 1.5000194165685572
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure."  "I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.: 1.9824490602232883
_Your_ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of ignorance.: 2.0130597136031687
But with _me_, it is not so.: 3.4872146894509735
Painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.: 2.097850143957369
I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.: 2.421466526920954
As a child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my temper.: 2.059133406752245
I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.: 1.996613094117961
Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_) I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own.: 2.079121559372407
Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth!: 1.6329858883076376
What do I not owe you!: 1.5070719348361816
You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.: 1.546990179865138
By you, I was properly humbled.: 2.966383561878907
I came to you without a doubt of my reception.: 2.008171018678313
You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."  "Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"  "Indeed I had.: 1.6593138967877494
What will you think of my vanity?: 2.1835100114682304
I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses."  "My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you.: 2.014229054213824
I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.: 1.6726103844818758
How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"  "Hate you!: 1.6685612319540024
I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction."  "I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at Pemberley.: 1.9723759471295719
You blamed me for coming?"  "No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."  "Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.: 1.9834629779880246
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you."  He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.: 1.97194526394105
She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.: 2.1915568837875314
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.: 2.496277231807138
"What could become of Mr.: 1.9724246948713637
Bingley and Jane!" was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs.: 2.053499693646817
"I must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elizabeth.: 3.2119376967369773
"Not at all.: 3.2047473999244143
When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."  "That is to say, you had given your permission.: 2.5774826690080554
I guessed as much." And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case.: 3.0499791251476833
"On the evening before my going to London," said he "I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.: 2.557687094889644
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs, absurd and impertinent.: 1.7153187861792423
His surprise was great.: 1.3940280924335033
He had never had the slightest suspicion.: 2.091202029288754
I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."  Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.: 2.500024481010663
"Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"  "From the former.: 2.035890373724193
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection."  "And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him."  "It did.: 2.329360194786248
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.: 1.285436303492376
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine, made every thing easy.: 1.9290207324765425
I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.: 2.1526103925988918
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.: 2.3548220637206585
He was angry.: 1.59478020828472
But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments.: 2.1199428222065784
He has heartily forgiven me now."  Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr.: 1.6328650058036498
Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself.: 1.950073253212606
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it was rather too early to begin.: 2.494030158293957
In the hall they parted.: 5.931261281219319
"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and from all the others when they sat down to table.: 2.6872206866274126
She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.: 1.8897246987587815
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.: 2.055168370626251
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.: 1.935960906391166
At night she opened her heart to Jane.: 1.515610150239221
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.: 2.7266036881420783
"You are joking, Lizzy.: 4.847393173730427
This cannot be!--engaged to Mr.: 1.5870992978040477
Darcy!: 10.466239490892104
No, no, you shall not deceive me.: 2.165400451601588
I know it to be impossible."  "This is a wretched beginning indeed!: 2.2945327077639646
My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.: 2.748850622848388
Yet, indeed, I am in earnest.: 4.476765083043062
I speak nothing but the truth.: 1.6064179483333054
He still loves me, and we are engaged."  Jane looked at her doubtingly.: 3.1177098986761114
"Oh, Lizzy!: 6.306611544263079
it cannot be.: 9.598720464585933
I know how much you dislike him."  "You know nothing of the matter.: 2.8986832782169465
_That_ is all to be forgot.: 2.001823011182663
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.: 2.519418206092253
But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.: 1.8860186523177722
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself."  Miss Bennet still looked all amazement.: 1.843294740252285
Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth.: 2.5660536749658793
can it be really so!: 2.0938080508542534
Yet now I must believe you," cried Jane.: 2.170246366380935
"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you certain?: 2.7361551675917353
forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?"  "There can be no doubt of that.: 2.3707873779093145
It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world.: 2.330186328011093
But are you pleased, Jane?: 2.205170917792055
Shall you like to have such a brother?"  "Very, very much.: 2.1092907349631704
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight.: 1.358592834485235
But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.: 1.9663313018820539
And do you really love him quite well enough?: 1.9782590425315647
Oh, Lizzy!: 1.7884819225792765
do any thing rather than marry without affection.: 1.7663992772620971
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?"  "Oh, yes!: 2.3285709389813096
You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I tell you all."  "What do you mean?"  "Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley.: 2.609950587557615
Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay.: 2.42036002839241
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley."  Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment.: 1.9476832402478477
When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish.: 2.7202873567799166
"Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself.: 3.022650435408616
I always had a value for him.: 1.685832392189276
Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me.: 2.163107787930489
But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.: 2.604818777027272
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton!: 1.7470299728118566
I owe all that I know of it, to another, not to you."  Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.: 2.489854601565169
She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend.: 2.414214805594151
But now she would no longer conceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage.: 2.0350061918611018
Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley!: 1.6244627230954896
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here?: 1.9082675592099612
I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company.: 2.5642906671853978
What shall we do with him?: 1.7527802802010717
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way."  Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.: 2.266303810854855
As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, "Mr.: 2.1721907000094567
Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"  "I advise Mr.: 2.356195632827173
Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs.: 2.5005695818858187
Bennet, "to walk to Oakham Mount this morning.: 2.8439340642116866
It is a nice long walk, and Mr.: 2.3514030806584514
Darcy has never seen the view."  "It may do very well for the others," replied Mr.: 1.9146323052998417
Bingley; "but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty.: 4.177159569041277
Wont it, Kitty?"  Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.: 1.9318802448459091
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented.: 1.943389120945644
As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs.: 1.636010880206059
Bennet followed her, saying,  "I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself.: 2.5897565992525076
But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then.: 2.758153885746445
So, do not put yourself to inconvenience."  During their walk, it was resolved that Mr.: 1.8803677613479042
Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening.: 2.4291984168042697
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's.: 2.2402559259782224
She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.: 1.7771573576261674
But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr.: 2.0443179513643837
Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.: 2.6249368011250387
*       *       *       *       *  In the evening, soon after Mr.: 2.661597336714866
Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme.: 2.123586582487336
She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr.: 2.386641948108237
Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.: 2.6769741238706986
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he wants you in the library." She was gone directly.: 2.2098520411573706
Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.: 2.916665032641286
"Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing?: 2.9635242119648977
Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man?: 1.9190128862573725
Have not you always hated him?"  How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate!: 1.5205613023176685
It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr.: 2.0143007459961866
"Or in other words, you are determined to have him.: 2.3903822181583423
He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.: 2.31057814883856
But will they make you happy?"  "Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my indifference?"  "None at all.: 1.807391246818489
We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him."  "I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him.: 2.557326227535568
He is perfectly amiable.: 2.5247024208129574
You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms."  "Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent.: 2.4495330559294533
He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask.: 2.635087994347204
I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on having him.: 2.1817355644686054
But let me advise you to think better of it.: 2.2126893670369125
I know your disposition, Lizzy.: 1.7593826827995092
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior.: 1.661268098361227
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage.: 1.5779300451533025
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery.: 1.3348861191686745
My child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life.: 1.6836023377009546
You know not what you are about."  Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr.: 1.9856214093128324
Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.: 2.117842375564347
"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to say.: 3.764482361954957
If this be the case, he deserves you.: 2.0583658066132284
Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.: 1.4521224857548058
He heard her with astonishment.: 5.098024310391027
"This is an evening of wonders, indeed!: 2.268639257841181
Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way.: 1.8156521952724796
I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."  He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr.: 2.257015533019724
Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."  Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure.: 2.2407490783586157
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication.: 2.4099161537506646
Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs.: 1.6364900679193592
Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them.: 2.37933365335108
She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.: 1.993843352930367
"Good gracious!: 1.2859883872212416
Lord bless me!: 1.279612140445351
only think!: 6.495948701393197
Darcy!: 10.466239490892104
And is it really true?: 1.5236286941433517
how rich and how great you will be!: 2.0876446404325035
What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have!: 1.9042870249580883
Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all.: 2.4724986386392573
I am so pleased--so happy.: 1.7841906231577997
Such a charming man!--so handsome!: 1.6974433275710898
so tall!--Oh, my dear Lizzy!: 2.6256539920383783
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.: 1.6023051679998936
Dear, dear Lizzy.: 3.957952559020898
A house in town!: 1.815181332882061
Three daughters married!: 1.6187922432246138
Ten thousand a year!: 3.500191926193105
Oh, Lord!: 1.1574017529972902
What will become of me.: 1.5174838920630722
But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.: 2.7168521241902512
'Tis as good as a Lord!: 1.7749062434512597
And a special licence.: 1.0900159464639263
You must and shall be married by a special licence.: 1.484280987021677
But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr.: 1.622294981521602
Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow."  This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for.: 2.237836244761458
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs.: 1.6700734984561725
Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.: 1.9859567860562064
Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.: 2.7022684518910793
"Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well as Jane's."     CHAPTER XVIII.: 2.5712941107973837
Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.: 2.1272620818068466
"How could you begin?" said she.: 4.257640166674329
"I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?"  "I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation.: 2.1514930453899246
It is too long ago.: 1.621337963498271
Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?"  "For the liveliness of your mind, I did."  "You may as well call it impertinence at once.: 1.8702785924222236
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention.: 2.107213065963699
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone.: 1.4244829758857582
I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike _them_.: 1.9256958009918952
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you.: 1.8449488972799393
There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.: 2.046904313289056
To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love."  "Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was ill at Netherfield?"  "Dearest Jane!: 1.7807852964551558
who could have done less for her?: 1.9259094486080008
But make a virtue of it by all means.: 1.6648566819159663
My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last.: 2.2037267530083673
What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?: 2.0763665298711524
But I wonder how long you _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.: 2.077342579189465
_Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the subject?: 2.2350986762618685
The moral will be perfectly fair.: 1.4484395894210997
Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of removing all my doubts.: 1.9392183089642647
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.: 1.738224133337463
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's.: 2.1419831539715974
But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for?: 2.184192228767198
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?: 1.4553167578195623
My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made."  "Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine, what is to befall her?"  "I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth.: 2.2812774175371886
But it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly."  "And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.: 2.3999967469456127
But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."  From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr.: 1.8224964697725947
Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs.: 2.0657063014841324
Gardiner's long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:       "I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have      done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but      to say the truth, I was too cross to write.: 2.1932278740225346
You supposed more than      really existed.: 1.375169071272333
You must write again very      soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.: 1.7612163486484385
I      thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes.: 2.820917139276711
How could I      be so silly as to wish it!: 2.1146749428732416
Your idea of the ponies is delightful.: 1.9013102620701074
We will go round the Park every day.: 1.8564861537837323
Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one      with such justice.: 2.047797435725943
I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I      laugh.: 1.5049638558176028
Darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can      spare from me.: 2.3975717587218277
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.: 2.0931798766705043
Your's, &c."  Mr.: 2.390184352059742
Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine, was in a different style; and still different from either, was what Mr.: 2.369485359981943
Bennet sent to Mr.: 1.3292707167610196
Collins, in reply to his last.: 3.8947900716472983
"DEAR SIR,       "I must trouble you once more for congratulations.: 2.370828092848413
Elizabeth will      soon be the wife of Mr.: 1.5628043776508591
Console Lady Catherine as well as      you can.: 2.8883637005837084
He has      more to give.: 3.8095805468424744
"Your's sincerely, &c."  Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere.: 2.456120728699265
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard.: 1.8873678854647795
Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.: 2.1244300946983086
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother's in sending it.: 1.776368774534178
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.: 1.9243851004567218
Before any answer could arrive from Mr.: 1.2535368454915863
Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge.: 2.3151360453338095
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident.: 1.7783182568836395
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over.: 1.8981638643305914
At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr.: 2.342186190657506
Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband.: 3.153720953032035
He bore it however with admirable calmness.: 1.8571446955294637
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St.: 2.002770922200324
James's, with very decent composure.: 2.662117522710005
If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.: 2.926629620815413
Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs.: 2.4235839143472
Philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.: 2.489787436735911
Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant.: 2.270816889676071
Elizabeth did all she could, to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.: 2.155095356486163
Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.: 1.6642377946088567
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs.: 1.225121964168389
Bingley and talked of Mrs.: 1.7336795178735946
Darcy may be guessed.: 1.505889150604935
I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children, produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.: 2.1808475810514425
Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do.: 1.7787602784915726
He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.: 2.0565007727330165
Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.: 1.8135857815237022
So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.: 1.9104163081695726
The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.: 1.947735877258965
Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters.: 1.999393454357593
In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great.: 1.9166379254809418
She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid.: 1.9788769916488265
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs.: 2.1298796043131936
Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.: 1.84134516221216
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs.: 1.9059403994616912
Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.: 2.411390613015567
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune.: 2.1427663172505067
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.: 2.0789106493589133
The letter was to this effect:       "MY DEAR LIZZY,       "I wish you joy.: 3.222226041301824
If you love Mr.: 1.1567931513258238
Darcy half as well as I do my dear      Wickham, you must be very happy.: 2.773569348838224
It is a great comfort to have you      so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will      think of us.: 2.9420009055869047
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very      much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live      upon without some help.: 2.2005164794873617
Any place would do, of about three or four      hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr.: 2.1418138718835733
Darcy about it,      if you had rather not.: 4.927662441269217
"Yours, &c."  As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.: 1.7509397664335253
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them.: 2.2014137507320926
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance towards discharging their bills.: 1.874417314933332
Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme.: 1.6517705441404
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.: 1.9618224697356517
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.: 1.9359344410821424
Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.: 2.0130660579506103
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.: 2.054017998653794
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.: 2.0528879598965895
Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.: 2.05868347078633
They were able to love each other, even as well as they intended.: 2.299268996671408
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother.: 1.9469596929017308
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way.: 1.6464934185718363
By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.: 2.0126801927416578
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end.: 2.104514794527829
But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.: 2.341337059715291
With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.: 2.2757313572774946
Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.: 2.2720204160630426
