Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of
lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.<eos>: 44.82646502266851
A yellow
dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild
morning air.<eos>: 80.92086844019437
He held the bowl aloft and intoned:

—_Introibo ad altare Dei_.

Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:

—Come up, Kinch!<eos>: 41.841037570204364
Come up, you fearful jesuit!

Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest.<eos>: 44.26808890148737
He faced about
and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the
awaking mountains.<eos>: 50.761603688788746
Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent
towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat
and shaking his head.<eos>: 36.961904230639874
Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned
his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking
gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light
untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.

Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the
bowl smartly.

—Back to barracks!<eos>: 69.59780843518541
he said sternly.

He added in a preacher’s tone:

—For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul
and blood and ouns.<eos>: 50.715404204393074
Slow music, please.<eos>: 22.26017167229984
Shut your eyes, gents.<eos>: 10.730281199869408
One
moment.<eos>: 8.721726929981859
A little trouble about those white corpuscles.<eos>: 47.10029382052803
Silence, all.

He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused
awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and
there with gold points.<eos>: 138.3246520820856
Chrysostomos.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Two strong shrill whistles
answered through the calm.

—Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly.<eos>: 75.88626971132179
That will do nicely.<eos>: 21.517093295303944
Switch off
the current, will you?

He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering
about his legs the loose folds of his gown.<eos>: 57.828798280589034
The plump shadowed face and
sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.
A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.

—The mockery of it!<eos>: 46.73601432277566
he said gaily.<eos>: 13.678954166745394
Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!

He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,
laughing to himself.<eos>: 77.5097813155211
Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily
halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as
he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and
lathered cheeks and neck.

Buck Mulligan’s gay voice went on.

—My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls.<eos>: 47.5144536725414
But it has a
Hellenic ring, hasn’t it?<eos>: 21.818373760515655
Tripping and sunny like the buck himself.<eos>: 42.96606992465617
We
must go to Athens.<eos>: 8.768528536255227
Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out
twenty quid?

He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:

—Will he come?<eos>: 77.45232815317983
The jejune jesuit!

Ceasing, he began to shave with care.

—Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.

—Yes, my love?

—How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?

Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.

—God, isn’t he dreadful?<eos>: 36.70213008462165
he said frankly.<eos>: 17.514924075948645
A ponderous Saxon.<eos>: 13.175381721000383
He thinks
you’re not a gentleman.<eos>: 14.001854925556778
God, these bloody English!<eos>: 38.55248619420772
Bursting with money
and indigestion.<eos>: 12.004879728454092
Because he comes from Oxford.<eos>: 37.41558550690958
You know, Dedalus, you
have the real Oxford manner.<eos>: 49.254193805292886
He can’t make you out.<eos>: 15.43773959642955
O, my name for you
is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.

He shaved warily over his chin.

—He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said.<eos>: 49.91158344954261
Where is
his guncase?

—A woful lunatic!<eos>: 17.31943553186842
Mulligan said.<eos>: 3.9235766537280665
Were you in a funk?

—I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear.<eos>: 35.44551941374835
Out here in the dark
with a man I don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a
black panther.<eos>: 36.613080915354374
You saved men from drowning.<eos>: 86.9489471561843
I’m not a hero, however.<eos>: 16.211937634114264
If
he stays on here I am off.

Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade.<eos>: 29.746392036375745
He hopped down
from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.

—Scutter!<eos>: 20.762168904391253
he cried thickly.

He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper
pocket, said:

—Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.

Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a
dirty crumpled handkerchief.<eos>: 57.34570201588956
Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.
Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:

—The bard’s noserag!<eos>: 26.195049691147947
A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.
You can almost taste it, can’t you?

He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair
oakpale hair stirring slightly.

—God!<eos>: 77.68706651247535
he said quietly.<eos>: 9.06525597395965
Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet
mother?<eos>: 52.192538507427734
The snotgreen sea.<eos>: 7.132796468774226
The scrotumtightening sea.<eos>: 7.132796468774226
_Epi oinopa
ponton_.<eos>: 3.3831009326705948
Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks!<eos>: 17.46512920514312
I must teach you.<eos>: 15.071786363196168
You must read them
in the original.<eos>: 21.37388882521967
_Thalatta!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
Thalatta!_ She is our great sweet mother.
Come and look.

Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet.<eos>: 50.22734506647834
Leaning on it he looked
down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of
Kingstown.

—Our mighty mother!<eos>: 27.966101563396997
Buck Mulligan said.

He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s
face.

—The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said.<eos>: 21.69342084380361
That’s why she won’t
let me have anything to do with you.

—Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.

—You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother
asked you, Buck Mulligan said.<eos>: 36.02211181535676
I’m hyperborean as much as you.<eos>: 11.750863982387743
But to
think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and
pray for her.<eos>: 68.69739987183497
And you refused.<eos>: 9.645575652533102
There is something sinister in you....

He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek.<eos>: 98.63029965511353
A tolerant
smile curled his lips.

—But a lovely mummer!<eos>: 33.69621443752519
he murmured to himself.<eos>: 17.454890301320557
Kinch, the loveliest
mummer of them all!

He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.

Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against
his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.
Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart.<eos>: 56.47450315026817
Silently,
in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within
its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood,
her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of
wetted ashes.<eos>: 62.341881604064724
Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a
great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him.<eos>: 37.089047712889105
The ring of bay and
skyline held a dull green mass of liquid.<eos>: 80.58365459158293
A bowl of white china had
stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had
torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.

Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.

—Ah, poor dogsbody!<eos>: 60.768504909774144
he said in a kind voice.<eos>: 37.75258628333861
I must give you a shirt
and a few noserags.<eos>: 26.788692078331927
How are the secondhand breeks?

—They fit well enough, Stephen answered.

Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.

—The mockery of it, he said contentedly.<eos>: 26.89042991916116
Secondleg they should be.<eos>: 23.269163267433346
God
knows what poxy bowsy left them off.<eos>: 52.001669586593664
I have a lovely pair with a hair
stripe, grey.<eos>: 38.80610393655613
You’ll look spiffing in them.<eos>: 13.030403084793786
I’m not joking, Kinch.<eos>: 8.784590123323841
You
look damn well when you’re dressed.

—Thanks, Stephen said.<eos>: 29.192744906021897
I can’t wear them if they are grey.

—He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.
Etiquette is etiquette.<eos>: 37.18754762145552
He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey
trousers.

He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the
smooth skin.

Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its
smokeblue mobile eyes.

—That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan,
says you have g.<eos>: 81.38927269005937
p.<eos>: 1.5609974020387252
i.<eos>: 6.524879146559638
He’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman.
General paralysis of the insane!

He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings
abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea.<eos>: 69.6391993357837
His curling shaven lips
laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth.<eos>: 39.33739144385666
Laughter seized
all his strong wellknit trunk.

—Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!

Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by
a crooked crack.<eos>: 47.4157808756849
Hair on end.<eos>: 22.6142070346051
As he and others see me.<eos>: 25.908527279042364
Who chose this
face for me?<eos>: 36.89326477307932
This dogsbody to rid of vermin.<eos>: 43.38989060381204
It asks me too.

—I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, Buck Mulligan said.<eos>: 14.566955332978674
It does her
all right.<eos>: 37.55580370091667
The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.
Lead him not into temptation.<eos>: 128.48029356534187
And her name is Ursula.

Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen’s peering eyes.

—The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said.<eos>: 44.3257505651678
If
Wilde were only alive to see you!

Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:

—It is a symbol of Irish art.<eos>: 66.42439979371504
The cracked lookingglass of a servant.

Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen’s and walked with him
round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he
had thrust them.

—It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it?<eos>: 43.20557743981999
he said kindly.
God knows you have more spirit than any of them.

Parried again.<eos>: 67.44695630036894
He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his.<eos>: 33.472235733897854
The
cold steel pen.

—Cracked lookingglass of a servant!<eos>: 65.36109730553736
Tell that to the oxy chap
downstairs and touch him for a guinea.<eos>: 40.21300578846438
He’s stinking with money and
thinks you’re not a gentleman.<eos>: 20.671552221289282
His old fellow made his tin by selling
jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other.<eos>: 82.39578719937072
God, Kinch, if you and
I could only work together we might do something for the island.
Hellenise it.

Cranly’s arm.<eos>: 52.36529144618572
His arm.

—And to think of your having to beg from these swine.<eos>: 67.78110451446013
I’m the only one
that knows what you are.<eos>: 24.58508244758908
Why don’t you trust me more?<eos>: 17.853965361673367
What have you up
your nose against me?<eos>: 33.940212799872825
Is it Haines?<eos>: 39.173451808582364
If he makes any noise here I’ll
bring down Seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave
Clive Kempthorpe.

Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe’s rooms.<eos>: 49.11193461186332
Palefaces:
they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another.<eos>: 89.45331660902917
O, I shall
expire!<eos>: 14.4169408941189
Break the news to her gently, Aubrey!<eos>: 38.3476639169267
I shall die!<eos>: 33.16586887773609
With slit
ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the
table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the
tailor’s shears.<eos>: 30.764947851926788
A scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade.<eos>: 57.13783517381312
I don’t
want to be debagged!<eos>: 9.40153101557417
Don’t you play the giddy ox with me!

Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle.<eos>: 53.08852337756657
A deaf
gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold’s face, pushes his mower
on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.

To ourselves...<eos>: 33.616365945043064
new paganism...<eos>: 10.05991307174802
omphalos.

—Let him stay, Stephen said.<eos>: 13.26712908014287
There’s nothing wrong with him except at
night.

—Then what is it?<eos>: 34.81960052397696
Buck Mulligan asked impatiently.<eos>: 11.307620836140247
Cough it up.<eos>: 11.487628084390794
I’m
quite frank with you.<eos>: 25.33875355049218
What have you against me now?

They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on
the water like the snout of a sleeping whale.<eos>: 54.733039664419806
Stephen freed his arm
quietly.

—Do you wish me to tell you?<eos>: 27.306123068128873
he asked.

—Yes, what is it?<eos>: 9.00374491450554
Buck Mulligan answered.<eos>: 5.702778119179099
I don’t remember anything.

He looked in Stephen’s face as he spoke.<eos>: 18.020204426319758
A light wind passed his brow,
fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of
anxiety in his eyes.

Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:

—Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s
death?

Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:

—What?<eos>: 43.36752860270375
Where?<eos>: 4.213136859000814
I can’t remember anything.<eos>: 11.455633627816733
I remember only ideas and
sensations.<eos>: 73.15776508144589
Why?<eos>: 4.396144867849921
What happened in the name of God?

—You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get
more hot water.<eos>: 42.834602771436536
Your mother and some visitor came out of the
drawingroom.<eos>: 28.86333124951007
She asked you who was in your room.

—Yes?<eos>: 28.33555731040181
Buck Mulligan said.<eos>: 2.8619024257519623
What did I say?<eos>: 9.567322942630616
I forget.

—You said, Stephen answered, _O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is
beastly dead._

A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck
Mulligan’s cheek.

—Did I say that?<eos>: 74.65628433176414
he asked.<eos>: 5.051942343743682
Well?<eos>: 4.8242193530921815
What harm is that?

He shook his constraint from him nervously.

—And what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own?<eos>: 40.646033801025396
You saw
only your mother die.<eos>: 42.40257164945319
I see them pop off every day in the Mater and
Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom.<eos>: 44.80889013694136
It’s a beastly
thing and nothing else.<eos>: 24.34875967618113
It simply doesn’t matter.<eos>: 28.710804606330925
You wouldn’t kneel
down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you.<eos>: 36.26569409445279
Why?
Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it’s injected
the wrong way.<eos>: 52.67757445716761
To me it’s all a mockery and beastly.<eos>: 35.85486553680974
Her cerebral lobes
are not functioning.<eos>: 14.009744637989234
She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks
buttercups off the quilt.<eos>: 82.71824363790326
Humour her till it’s over.<eos>: 26.489079420761882
You crossed her
last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don’t whinge like
some hired mute from Lalouette’s.<eos>: 49.41277364039249
Absurd!<eos>: 8.860933046772931
I suppose I did say it.<eos>: 28.897419645451144
I
didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother.

He had spoken himself into boldness.<eos>: 25.76130186389822
Stephen, shielding the gaping
wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:

—I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.

—Of what then?<eos>: 59.36836593609413
Buck Mulligan asked.

—Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.

Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.

—O, an impossible person!<eos>: 37.62673939745215
he exclaimed.

He walked off quickly round the parapet.<eos>: 30.141701282584183
Stephen stood at his post,
gazing over the calm sea towards the headland.<eos>: 50.54671081055408
Sea and headland now
grew dim.<eos>: 44.02223514347546
Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he
felt the fever of his cheeks.

A voice within the tower called loudly:

—Are you up there, Mulligan?

—I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.

He turned towards Stephen and said:

—Look at the sea.<eos>: 39.85077897932674
What does it care about offences?<eos>: 31.773998376749063
Chuck Loyola,
Kinch, and come on down.<eos>: 28.53126934379169
The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.

His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level
with the roof:

—Don’t mope over it all day, he said.<eos>: 34.68992640205654
I’m inconsequent.<eos>: 3.6928716194660365
Give up the
moody brooding.

His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of
the stairhead:

     And no more turn aside and brood
     Upon love’s bitter mystery
     For Fergus rules the brazen cars.

Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the
stairhead seaward where he gazed.<eos>: 53.848444458085375
Inshore and farther out the mirror of
water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet.<eos>: 64.81174250606361
White breast of the
dim sea.<eos>: 21.226818309780597
The twining stresses, two by two.<eos>: 48.83626083769541
A hand plucking the
harpstrings, merging their twining chords.<eos>: 24.543631401375524
Wavewhite wedded words
shimmering on the dim tide.

A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in
deeper green.<eos>: 51.03054326079196
It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters.<eos>: 47.284957949979265
Fergus’
song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords.
Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music.<eos>: 89.68147172525106
Silent with awe and
pity I went to her bedside.<eos>: 39.24595269530261
She was crying in her wretched bed.<eos>: 49.190569987412246
For
those words, Stephen: love’s bitter mystery.

Where now?

Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk,
a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer.<eos>: 39.68086437399531
A birdcage hung in the
sunny window of her house when she was a girl.<eos>: 24.669408109046966
She heard old Royce sing
in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he
sang:

     I am the boy
     That can enjoy
     Invisibility.

Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.

     And no more turn aside and brood.


Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys.<eos>: 79.31582340291405
Memories beset his
brooding brain.<eos>: 13.150737861843124
Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had
approached the sacrament.<eos>: 75.69892035089488
A cored apple, filled with brown sugar,
roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening.<eos>: 80.3076136244048
Her shapely
fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s
shirts.

In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its
loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath,
bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.

Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul.<eos>: 63.79240928405063
On
me alone.<eos>: 12.103284568104822
The ghostcandle to light her agony.<eos>: 39.33992238500081
Ghostly light on the
tortured face.<eos>: 17.008617844001932
Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all
prayed on their knees.<eos>: 134.3415702515093
Her eyes on me to strike me down.<eos>: 40.497537080618606
_Liliata
rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum
chorus excipiat._

Ghoul!<eos>: 17.499888510265627
Chewer of corpses!

No, mother!<eos>: 30.698553269172418
Let me be and let me live.

—Kinch ahoy!

Buck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower.<eos>: 43.21839809311119
It came nearer up the
staircase, calling again.<eos>: 38.82490616148632
Stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry,
heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.

—Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey.<eos>: 74.3416348806755
Breakfast is ready.<eos>: 22.53829095513517
Haines is
apologising for waking us last night.<eos>: 46.30791914771124
It’s all right.

—I’m coming, Stephen said, turning.

—Do, for Jesus’ sake, Buck Mulligan said.<eos>: 14.45588942106484
For my sake and for all our
sakes.

His head disappeared and reappeared.

—I told him your symbol of Irish art.<eos>: 45.17779188010357
He says it’s very clever.<eos>: 26.540607723915784
Touch
him for a quid, will you?<eos>: 26.4890084066955
A guinea, I mean.

—I get paid this morning, Stephen said.

—The school kip?<eos>: 35.36281043020114
Buck Mulligan said.<eos>: 2.8619024257519623
How much?<eos>: 10.698938661476618
Four quid?<eos>: 26.36384378546337
Lend us one.

—If you want it, Stephen said.

—Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight.<eos>: 27.19540484231242
We’ll have
a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids.<eos>: 13.055080104473909
Four omnipotent
sovereigns.

He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of
tune with a Cockney accent:

     O, won’t we have a merry time,
     Drinking whisky, beer and wine!
     On coronation,
     Coronation day!
     O, won’t we have a merry time
     On coronation day!

Warm sunshine merrying over the sea.<eos>: 61.37933449972286
The nickel shavingbowl shone,
forgotten, on the parapet.<eos>: 28.200541041681557
Why should I bring it down?<eos>: 28.983834107572047
Or leave it
there all day, forgotten friendship?

He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,
smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.
So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes.<eos>: 67.99490628676598
I am another now
and yet the same.<eos>: 50.37737039782629
A servant too.<eos>: 22.728235745490892
A server of a servant.

In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan’s gowned form
moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its
yellow glow.<eos>: 72.55137656857438
Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor
from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of
coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.

—We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said.<eos>: 44.955833435817524
Haines, open that door, will you?

Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker.<eos>: 37.49188019049591
A tall figure rose from the
hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open
the inner doors.

—Have you the key?<eos>: 47.351104818091564
a voice asked.

—Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said.<eos>: 18.78278685773112
Janey Mack, I’m choked!

He howled, without looking up from the fire:

—Kinch!

—It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.

The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been
set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered.<eos>: 62.28602292010064
Haines stood at the
doorway, looking out.<eos>: 22.71642954870026
Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and
sat down to wait.<eos>: 23.865501882602853
Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside
him.<eos>: 28.02293526159042
Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set
them down heavily and sighed with relief.

—I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when...<eos>: 60.46444466042562
But, hush!<eos>: 26.381824931201237
Not a
word more on that subject!<eos>: 74.17002055064701
Kinch, wake up!<eos>: 36.96645729305424
Bread, butter, honey.
Haines, come in.<eos>: 42.091105786548155
The grub is ready.<eos>: 12.059830358345016
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy
gifts.<eos>: 37.81637411162248
Where’s the sugar?<eos>: 14.131099849911205
O, jay, there’s no milk.

Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from
the locker.<eos>: 26.28450500865439
Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.

—What sort of a kip is this?<eos>: 31.74154109011447
he said.<eos>: 3.492439908750907
I told her to come after eight.

—We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily.<eos>: 38.640400149094354
There’s a lemon in the
locker.

—O, damn you and your Paris fads!<eos>: 38.33338233037274
Buck Mulligan said.<eos>: 2.8619024257519623
I want Sandycove
milk.

Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:

—That woman is coming up with the milk.

—The blessings of God on you!<eos>: 50.09783769504142
Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his
chair.<eos>: 21.43049514310761
Sit down.<eos>: 13.567749809525191
Pour out the tea there.<eos>: 42.70240144404778
The sugar is in the bag.<eos>: 32.46987301406891
Here,
I can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs.

He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three
plates, saying:

—_In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti._

Haines sat down to pour out the tea.

—I’m giving you two lumps each, he said.<eos>: 31.345801405656683
But, I say, Mulligan, you do
make strong tea, don’t you?

Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old
woman’s wheedling voice:

—When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said.<eos>: 46.947746661845514
And when I
makes water I makes water.

—By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.

Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:

—_So I do, Mrs Cahill,_ says she.<eos>: 35.2982528823946
_Begob, ma’am,_ says Mrs Cahill, _God
send you don’t make them in the one pot._

He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled
on his knife.

—That’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines.<eos>: 43.81114816958147
Five lines
of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of
Dundrum.<eos>: 57.07220355755171
Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.

He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his
brows:

—Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken
of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?

—I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.

—Do you now?<eos>: 55.51064844606219
Buck Mulligan said in the same tone.<eos>: 9.682400655064558
Your reasons, pray?

—I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the
Mabinogion.<eos>: 36.56340420555506
Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.

Buck Mulligan’s face smiled with delight.

—Charming!<eos>: 30.06078937283419
he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth
and blinking his eyes pleasantly.<eos>: 35.58990626334982
Do you think she was?<eos>: 19.26416116929841
Quite charming!

Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened
rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:

_—For old Mary Ann

She doesn’t care a damn.

But, hising up her petticoats..._

He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.

The doorway was darkened by an entering form.

—The milk, sir!

—Come in, ma’am, Mulligan said.<eos>: 53.279729914595954
Kinch, get the jug.

An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen’s elbow.

—That’s a lovely morning, sir, she said.<eos>: 25.202676821675123
Glory be to God.

—To whom?<eos>: 37.24015374426889
Mulligan said, glancing at her.<eos>: 17.937197206467573
Ah, to be sure!

Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.

—The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of
the collector of prepuces.

—How much, sir?<eos>: 30.624647033334174
asked the old woman.

—A quart, Stephen said.

He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white
milk, not hers.<eos>: 105.11482274773063
Old shrunken paps.<eos>: 3.3664333677147025
She poured again a measureful and a
tilly.<eos>: 18.45105860975893
Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a
messenger.<eos>: 160.46188771597676
She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.
Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on
her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs.<eos>: 46.85546543727514
They
lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle.<eos>: 41.64639901669376
Silk of the kine and
poor old woman, names given her in old times.<eos>: 76.50465821788812
A wandering crone, lowly
form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their
common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning.<eos>: 56.25662067199352
To serve or to
upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.

—It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.

—Taste it, sir, she said.

He drank at her bidding.

—If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat
loudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten
guts.<eos>: 62.03296425594174
Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved
with dust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits.

—Are you a medical student, sir?<eos>: 40.98784421811048
the old woman asked.

—I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered.

—Look at that now, she said.

Stephen listened in scornful silence.<eos>: 28.769507117279893
She bows her old head to a voice
that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she
slights.<eos>: 83.87865619184944
To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there
is of her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in
God’s likeness, the serpent’s prey.<eos>: 63.96604645103592
And to the loud voice that now bids
her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.

—Do you understand what he says?<eos>: 59.33086918814099
Stephen asked her.

—Is it French you are talking, sir?<eos>: 53.18620223075994
the old woman said to Haines.

Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.

—Irish, Buck Mulligan said.<eos>: 49.134459535200214
Is there Gaelic on you?

—I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it.<eos>: 35.590965523521064
Are you from the
west, sir?

—I am an Englishman, Haines answered.

—He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak
Irish in Ireland.

—Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak
the language myself.<eos>: 32.62928259811554
I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows.

—Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan.<eos>: 56.39434945468642
Wonderful entirely.<eos>: 31.527010213129607
Fill
us out some more tea, Kinch.<eos>: 54.78663585082431
Would you like a cup, ma’am?

—No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the
milkcan on her forearm and about to go.

Haines said to her:

—Have you your bill?<eos>: 43.24751715638231
We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?

Stephen filled again the three cups.

—Bill, sir?<eos>: 79.88077115442563
she said, halting.<eos>: 6.014599783192348
Well, it’s seven mornings a pint at
twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three
mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling.<eos>: 124.64095792426642
That’s a
shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.

Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly
buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search
his trouser pockets.

—Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.

Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the
thick rich milk.<eos>: 64.7362959794852
Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in
his fingers and cried:

—A miracle!

He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:

—Ask nothing more of me, sweet.<eos>: 45.862043156311465
All I can give you I give.

Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.

—We’ll owe twopence, he said.

—Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin.<eos>: 28.90758627661308
Time enough.<eos>: 9.373606051157516
Good
morning, sir.

She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant:

_—Heart of my heart, were it more,

More would be laid at your feet._

He turned to Stephen and said:

—Seriously, Dedalus.<eos>: 51.221423606433824
I’m stony.<eos>: 12.034183744944553
Hurry out to your school kip and bring
us back some money.<eos>: 94.73617874189499
Today the bards must drink and junket.<eos>: 21.205924474005435
Ireland
expects that every man this day will do his duty.

—That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your
national library today.

—Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.

He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:

—Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?

Then he said to Haines:

—The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.

—All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey
trickle over a slice of the loaf.

Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the
loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:

—I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.

Speaking to me.<eos>: 60.211705002523054
They wash and tub and scrub.<eos>: 13.345852023638606
Agenbite of inwit.
Conscience.<eos>: 37.62284963944905
Yet here’s a spot.

—That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol
of Irish art is deuced good.

Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with
warmth of tone:

—Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.

—Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen.<eos>: 46.62067497395054
I was just
thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.

—Would I make any money by it?<eos>: 52.86541673153356
Stephen asked.

Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of
the hammock, said:

—I don’t know, I’m sure.

He strolled out to the doorway.<eos>: 17.652467002039497
Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen
and said with coarse vigour:

—You put your hoof in it now.<eos>: 43.97228884948121
What did you say that for?

—Well?<eos>: 20.979341671466173
Stephen said.<eos>: 3.8431400504305624
The problem is to get money.<eos>: 37.21797059554573
From whom?<eos>: 19.25676288162961
From the
milkwoman or from him.<eos>: 16.09020160796081
It’s a toss up, I think.

—I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along
with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.

—I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.

Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm.

—From me, Kinch, he said.

In a suddenly changed tone he added:

—To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right.<eos>: 38.04057432822711
Damn all else they
are good for.<eos>: 71.5671854037783
Why don’t you play them as I do?<eos>: 20.232352911875843
To hell with them all.
Let us get out of the kip.

He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying
resignedly:

—Mulligan is stripped of his garments.

He emptied his pockets on to the table.

—There’s your snotrag, he said.

And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,
chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain.<eos>: 34.467762366839324
His hands plunged and
rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief.<eos>: 61.50738384665659
God,
we’ll simply have to dress the character.<eos>: 32.508463762444705
I want puce gloves and green
boots.<eos>: 48.21381178422273
Contradiction.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Do I contradict myself?<eos>: 12.74150802144128
Very well then, I
contradict myself.<eos>: 28.68124272389881
Mercurial Malachi.<eos>: 19.479432385521424
A limp black missile flew out of
his talking hands.

—And there’s your Latin quarter hat, he said.

Stephen picked it up and put it on.<eos>: 52.37443002024928
Haines called to them from the
doorway:

—Are you coming, you fellows?

—I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door.<eos>: 31.402874363504772
Come out,
Kinch.<eos>: 13.327446966474946
You have eaten all we left, I suppose.<eos>: 42.13904615858532
Resigned he passed out
with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:

—And going forth he met Butterly.

Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out
and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and
locked it.<eos>: 72.39453491156308
He put the huge key in his inner pocket.

At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:

—Did you bring the key?

—I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.

He walked on.<eos>: 31.67630635640342
Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy
bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.

—Down, sir!<eos>: 43.55287991647091
How dare you, sir!

Haines asked:

—Do you pay rent for this tower?

—Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.

—To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.

They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:

—Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say.<eos>: 50.68944445777547
Martello you call it?

—Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on
the sea.<eos>: 43.69023219251015
But ours is the _omphalos_.

—What is your idea of Hamlet?<eos>: 27.061401637139284
Haines asked Stephen.

—No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain.<eos>: 33.93859059949001
I’m not equal to Thomas Aquinas
and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up.<eos>: 32.54440123965194
Wait till I
have a few pints in me first.

He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his
primrose waistcoat:

—You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?

—It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.

—You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably.<eos>: 43.53531970825931
Is it some paradox?

—Pooh!<eos>: 15.04371001044244
Buck Mulligan said.<eos>: 2.8619024257519623
We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.
It’s quite simple.<eos>: 30.04180113753731
He proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is
Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own
father.

—What?<eos>: 31.791507112829862
Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen.<eos>: 39.78923966877623
He himself?

Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in
loose laughter, said to Stephen’s ear:

—O, shade of Kinch the elder!<eos>: 47.775067402234505
Japhet in search of a father!

—We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines.<eos>: 35.93346820826195
And it is
rather long to tell.

Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.

—The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.

—I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this
tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore.<eos>: 56.30961014457226
_That
beetles o’er his base into the sea,_ isn’t it?

Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did
not speak.<eos>: 48.762444996018274
In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in
cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.

—It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.

Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.
The seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the
smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail
tacking by the Muglins.

—I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.
The Father and the Son idea.<eos>: 58.19816805722824
The Son striving to be atoned with the
Father.

Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face.<eos>: 43.16471489366541
He looked
at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had
suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety.<eos>: 78.55023793474666
He moved
a doll’s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and
began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:

_—I’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.
My mother’s a jew, my father’s a bird.
With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.
So here’s to disciples and Calvary._

He held up a forefinger of warning.

_—If anyone thinks that I amn’t divine
He’ll get no free drinks when I’m making the wine
But have to drink water and wish it were plain
That I make when the wine becomes water again._

He tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running
forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like
fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:

_—Goodbye, now, goodbye!<eos>: 58.02796784607047
Write down all I said
And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.
What’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly
And Olivet’s breezy...<eos>: 73.14377779809305
Goodbye, now, goodbye!_

He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his
winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh
wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.

Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and
said:

—We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose.<eos>: 51.45843980399571
He’s rather blasphemous.<eos>: 7.155274661083315
I’m not a
believer myself, that is to say.<eos>: 16.21984047047418
Still his gaiety takes the harm out of
it somehow, doesn’t it?<eos>: 59.92629640568823
What did he call it?<eos>: 13.35900116072389
Joseph the Joiner?

—The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.

—O, Haines said, you have heard it before?

—Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.

—You’re not a believer, are you?<eos>: 27.241012898589805
Haines asked.<eos>: 6.237964738479483
I mean, a believer in
the narrow sense of the word.<eos>: 20.93658090873868
Creation from nothing and miracles and a
personal God.

—There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.

Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a
green stone.<eos>: 47.310014062992565
He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.

—Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.

Haines helped himself and snapped the case to.<eos>: 43.21967517253898
He put it back in his
sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang
it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk
towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.

—Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again.<eos>: 41.16638068289535
Either you believe or
you don’t, isn’t it?<eos>: 17.721412062577517
Personally I couldn’t stomach that idea of a
personal God.<eos>: 40.746185423968534
You don’t stand for that, I suppose?

—You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible
example of free thought.

He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his
side.<eos>: 44.06653251189679
Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.
My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen!<eos>: 57.427451988283245
A wavering line
along the path.<eos>: 22.115038792146475
They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.
He wants that key.<eos>: 49.04673544970405
It is mine.<eos>: 12.216377641033409
I paid the rent.<eos>: 20.883527603382326
Now I eat his salt
bread.<eos>: 84.98078663934696
Give him the key too.<eos>: 15.490176320886968
All.<eos>: 3.9771051254033254
He will ask for it.<eos>: 22.18175578283001
That was in his
eyes.

—After all, Haines began...

Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was
not all unkind.

—After all, I should think you are able to free yourself.<eos>: 69.76874630006228
You are your
own master, it seems to me.

—I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an
Italian.

—Italian?<eos>: 43.40066448877272
Haines said.

A crazy queen, old and jealous.<eos>: 73.65144370182514
Kneel down before me.

—And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.

—Italian?<eos>: 52.03777889585889
Haines said again.<eos>: 10.271050428095075
What do you mean?

—The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and
the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.

Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he
spoke.

—I can quite understand that, he said calmly.<eos>: 50.5365553871262
An Irishman must think
like that, I daresay.<eos>: 51.16276136878273
We feel in England that we have treated you
rather unfairly.<eos>: 61.837453496426555
It seems history is to blame.

The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen’s memory the triumph of
their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam
ecclesiam:_ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own
rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars.<eos>: 74.86505084423986
Symbol of the apostles in the mass
for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in
affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church
militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs.<eos>: 46.668980444921
A horde of heresies
fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom
Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the
consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning
Christ’s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who
held that the Father was Himself His own Son.<eos>: 36.373021837625494
Words Mulligan had spoken
a moment since in mockery to the stranger.<eos>: 91.6293990544612
Idle mockery.<eos>: 17.145600695531773
The void
awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a
worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael’s host, who
defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their
shields.

Hear, hear!<eos>: 55.337856719899534
Prolonged applause.<eos>: 13.416139668500607
_Zut!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
Nom de Dieu!_

—Of course I’m a Britisher, Haines’s voice said, and I feel as one.<eos>: 25.47911617648396
I
don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.
That’s our national problem, I’m afraid, just now.

Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman,
boatman.

—She’s making for Bullock harbour.

The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.

—There’s five fathoms out there, he said.<eos>: 44.770851228707194
It’ll be swept up that way
when the tide comes in about one.<eos>: 52.207245521199006
It’s nine days today.

The man that was drowned.<eos>: 34.57105510564653
A sail veering about the blank bay waiting
for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face,
saltwhite.<eos>: 97.20911151239008
Here I am.

They followed the winding path down to the creek.<eos>: 33.792880009743236
Buck Mulligan stood
on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his
shoulder.<eos>: 22.437027973075466
A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly
frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.

—Is the brother with you, Malachi?

—Down in Westmeath.<eos>: 58.25723954476984
With the Bannons.

—Still there?<eos>: 14.722570219918769
I got a card from Bannon.<eos>: 44.02844379889339
Says he found a sweet young
thing down there.<eos>: 64.19836659612783
Photo girl he calls her.

—Snapshot, eh?<eos>: 44.486591578469984
Brief exposure.

Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots.<eos>: 28.11435319749616
An elderly man shot up near
the spur of rock a blowing red face.<eos>: 112.02832693030159
He scrambled up by the stones,
water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water
rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black
sagging loincloth.

Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines
and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and
lips and breastbone.

—Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of
rock.<eos>: 59.90458927133439
Chucked medicine and going in for the army.

—Ah, go to God!<eos>: 54.72451093219583
Buck Mulligan said.

—Going over next week to stew.<eos>: 50.67749583793169
You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?

—Yes.

—Spooning with him last night on the pier.<eos>: 63.694378759140136
The father is rotto with
money.

—Is she up the pole?

—Better ask Seymour that.

—Seymour a bleeding officer!<eos>: 76.90091554832505
Buck Mulligan said.

He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying
tritely:

—Redheaded women buck like goats.

He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.

—My twelfth rib is gone, he cried.<eos>: 41.07165006301634
I’m the _Übermensch._ Toothless
Kinch and I, the supermen.

He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his
clothes lay.

—Are you going in here, Malachi?

—Yes.<eos>: 31.474236027753925
Make room in the bed.

The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the
middle of the creek in two long clean strokes.<eos>: 47.214282314568756
Haines sat down on a
stone, smoking.

—Are you not coming in?<eos>: 36.58963868925168
Buck Mulligan asked.

—Later on, Haines said.<eos>: 13.517831531003399
Not on my breakfast.

Stephen turned away.

—I’m going, Mulligan, he said.

—Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.

Stephen handed him the key.<eos>: 26.02284418291483
Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped
clothes.

—And twopence, he said, for a pint.<eos>: 22.62716672059227
Throw it there.

Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap.<eos>: 63.05625517118171
Dressing, undressing.<eos>: 5.017649406720244
Buck
Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:

—He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord.<eos>: 46.123437677729044
Thus spake
Zarathustra.

His plump body plunged.

—We’ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the
path and smiling at wild Irish.

Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.

—The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried.<eos>: 46.177711443363336
Half twelve.

—Good, Stephen said.

He walked along the upwardcurving path.

     Liliata rutilantium.
     Turma circumdet.
     Iubilantium te virginum.

The priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly.<eos>: 20.75511011159772
I will
not sleep here tonight.<eos>: 32.78457229463825
Home also I cannot go.

A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea.<eos>: 33.32843433758234
Turning
the curve he waved his hand.<eos>: 25.307798418603113
It called again.<eos>: 18.618338459644576
A sleek brown head, a
seal’s, far out on the water, round.

Usurper.




[ 2 ]


—You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?

—Tarentum, sir.

—Very good.<eos>: 54.67234289458568
Well?

—There was a battle, sir.

—Very good.<eos>: 24.077209655351666
Where?

The boy’s blank face asked the blank window.

Fabled by the daughters of memory.<eos>: 35.349738540488445
And yet it was in some way if not as
memory fabled it.<eos>: 51.42369612869334
A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake’s wings
of excess.<eos>: 29.858442165639037
I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling
masonry, and time one livid final flame.<eos>: 79.23109662468835
What’s left us then?

—I forget the place, sir.<eos>: 24.77516581214487
279 B.<eos>: 8.464209399594727
C.

—Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the
gorescarred book.

—Yes, sir.<eos>: 16.97290148581644
And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done
for._

That phrase the world had remembered.<eos>: 66.15952610278191
A dull ease of the mind.<eos>: 15.93415601934446
From a
hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers,
leaned upon his spear.<eos>: 103.56654200008649
Any general to any officers.<eos>: 69.24976892965611
They lend ear.

—You, Armstrong, Stephen said.<eos>: 24.9369314447924
What was the end of Pyrrhus?

—End of Pyrrhus, sir?

—I know, sir.<eos>: 18.579938092873363
Ask me, sir, Comyn said.

—Wait.<eos>: 14.152032540064956
You, Armstrong.<eos>: 13.719488351075961
Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?

A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong’s satchel.<eos>: 36.680428013541615
He curled them
between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly.<eos>: 100.72651932320825
Crumbs adhered
to the tissue of his lips.<eos>: 17.42111151902593
A sweetened boy’s breath.<eos>: 10.71360191909189
Welloff people,
proud that their eldest son was in the navy.<eos>: 77.03112560726888
Vico Road, Dalkey.

—Pyrrhus, sir?<eos>: 33.3623694864279
Pyrrhus, a pier.

All laughed.<eos>: 49.226068948162386
Mirthless high malicious laughter.<eos>: 20.14281064851038
Armstrong looked round
at his classmates, silly glee in profile.<eos>: 28.059382726835
In a moment they will laugh
more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.

—Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy’s shoulder with the book,
what is a pier.

—A pier, sir, Armstrong said.<eos>: 44.800718838102455
A thing out in the water.<eos>: 22.076608999572823
A kind of a
bridge.<eos>: 18.519071691624404
Kingstown pier, sir.

Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning.<eos>: 80.83818516319234
Two in the back bench
whispered.<eos>: 100.17132560886205
Yes.<eos>: 2.0880743848448278
They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.
All.<eos>: 239.58335317503546
With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily.<eos>: 36.2300419251213
Their
likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets
tittering in the struggle.

—Kingstown pier, Stephen said.<eos>: 26.079171679055882
Yes, a disappointed bridge.

The words troubled their gaze.

—How, sir?<eos>: 39.131182489204264
Comyn asked.<eos>: 13.747982794376908
A bridge is across a river.

For Haines’s chapbook.<eos>: 48.956306700163445
No-one here to hear.<eos>: 36.30894112839211
Tonight deftly amid wild
drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind.<eos>: 72.41243876292916
What then?<eos>: 10.051435056014776
A
jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a
clement master’s praise.<eos>: 16.941482507831108
Why had they chosen all that part?<eos>: 38.53277504483354
Not wholly
for the smooth caress.<eos>: 39.58102326637372
For them too history was a tale like any other
too often heard, their land a pawnshop.

Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not
been knifed to death.<eos>: 81.45634341474081
They are not to be thought away.<eos>: 24.46051182948233
Time has branded
them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite
possibilities they have ousted.<eos>: 54.506575815229034
But can those have been possible seeing
that they never were?<eos>: 102.54249932741553
Or was that only possible which came to pass?
Weave, weaver of the wind.

—Tell us a story, sir.

—O, do, sir.<eos>: 44.58938183719317
A ghoststory.

—Where do you begin in this?<eos>: 21.02506405695201
Stephen asked, opening another book.

—_Weep no more,_ Comyn said.

—Go on then, Talbot.

—And the story, sir?

—After, Stephen said.<eos>: 34.51815172002953
Go on, Talbot.

A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork
of his satchel.<eos>: 36.437819746163846
He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:

_—Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more
For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor..._

It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.
Aristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated
out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where
he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night.<eos>: 67.54569565868331
By his
elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy.<eos>: 17.866164530666538
Fed and feeding
brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating
feelers: and in my mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld,
reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds.<eos>: 52.78108100269201
Thought
is the thought of thought.<eos>: 45.60893794728935
Tranquil brightness.<eos>: 15.723794113153097
The soul is in a manner
all that is: the soul is the form of forms.<eos>: 62.57880387346526
Tranquility sudden, vast,
candescent: form of forms.

Talbot repeated:

_—Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,

Through the dear might..._

—Turn over, Stephen said quietly.<eos>: 146.45616194222953
I don’t see anything.

—What, sir?<eos>: 10.322602557094886
Talbot asked simply, bending forward.

His hand turned the page over.<eos>: 80.68295028641572
He leaned back and went on again, having
just remembered.<eos>: 56.57969941516221
Of him that walked the waves.<eos>: 35.39172633939324
Here also over these
craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer’s heart and lips and
on mine.<eos>: 78.5797127720254
It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the
tribute.<eos>: 73.86945913830561
To Caesar what is Caesar’s, to God what is God’s.<eos>: 40.95250130103312
A long look
from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the
church’s looms.<eos>: 35.90521573424852
Ay.

     Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.
     My father gave me seeds to sow.

Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.

—Have I heard all?<eos>: 60.963280648076704
Stephen asked.

—Yes, sir.<eos>: 7.300289314004088
Hockey at ten, sir.

—Half day, sir.<eos>: 29.953572303428732
Thursday.

—Who can answer a riddle?<eos>: 30.64581550937643
Stephen asked.

They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.
Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all
gabbling gaily:

—A riddle, sir?<eos>: 41.757065150975734
Ask me, sir.

—O, ask me, sir.

—A hard one, sir.

—This is the riddle, Stephen said:

     The cock crew,
     The sky was blue:
     The bells in heaven
     Were striking eleven.
     ’Tis time for this poor soul
     To go to heaven.

What is that?

—What, sir?

—Again, sir.<eos>: 40.9493623909562
We didn’t hear.

Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated.<eos>: 49.01745503185068
After a silence
Cochrane said:

—What is it, sir?<eos>: 24.776385766954146
We give it up.

Stephen, his throat itching, answered:

—The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.

He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries
echoed dismay.

A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:

—Hockey!

They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them.<eos>: 50.18066324425022
Quickly
they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and
clamour of their boots and tongues.

Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open
copybook.<eos>: 91.60504019329723
His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness
and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading.<eos>: 122.8816566670898
On his
cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent
and damp as a snail’s bed.

He held out his copybook.<eos>: 45.964697570404
The word _Sums_ was written on the headline.
Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with
blind loops and a blot.<eos>: 80.68033849520658
Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.

—Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them
to you, sir.

Stephen touched the edges of the book.<eos>: 42.665188092541925
Futility.

—Do you understand how to do them now?<eos>: 27.653129427400756
he asked.

—Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered.<eos>: 69.46081013444177
Mr Deasy said I was to
copy them off the board, sir.

—Can you do them yourself?<eos>: 36.55776134593718
Stephen asked.

—No, sir.

Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a
snail’s bed.<eos>: 35.5728678219292
Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in
her heart.<eos>: 63.683971620397784
But for her the race of the world would have trampled him
underfoot, a squashed boneless snail.<eos>: 25.74221779765987
She had loved his weak watery
blood drained from her own.<eos>: 68.2105152900352
Was that then real?<eos>: 72.16172370261246
The only true thing in
life?<eos>: 49.63243783079244
His mother’s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal
bestrode.<eos>: 14.486280626062708
She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in
the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes.<eos>: 57.276171041312104
She had saved him from
being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been.<eos>: 75.03566576691719
A poor
soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red
reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the
earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.

Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem.<eos>: 100.64171392911177
He proves by
algebra that Shakespeare’s ghost is Hamlet’s grandfather.<eos>: 30.685190018025708
Sargent
peered askance through his slanted glasses.<eos>: 42.08792694604066
Hockeysticks rattled in the
lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.

Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of
their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes.<eos>: 49.34506422580108
Give hands,
traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors.<eos>: 35.83146533876162
Gone too from
the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and
movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the
world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not
comprehend.

—Do you understand now?<eos>: 82.81519114534956
Can you work the second for yourself?

—Yes, sir.

In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data.<eos>: 43.49882096519169
Waiting always for a
word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint
hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin.<eos>: 87.874806993628
_Amor matris:_ subjective
and objective genitive.<eos>: 6.601158594336412
With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had
fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.

Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness.<eos>: 109.72829613388306
My
childhood bends beside me.<eos>: 90.07586982228847
Too far for me to lay a hand there once or
lightly.<eos>: 103.44100369687571
Mine is far and his secret as our eyes.<eos>: 87.45188498319186
Secrets, silent, stony
sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their
tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.

The sum was done.

—It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.

—Yes, sir.<eos>: 46.67122510714177
Thanks, Sargent answered.

He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his
copybook back to his bench.

—You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said
as he followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form.

—Yes, sir.

In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.

—Sargent!

—Run on, Stephen said.<eos>: 36.765338432386976
Mr Deasy is calling you.

He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy
field where sharp voices were in strife.<eos>: 62.00983221747102
They were sorted in teams and
Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet.
When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to
him.<eos>: 48.784236837728535
He turned his angry white moustache.

—What is it now?<eos>: 27.224670200849786
he cried continually without listening.

—Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.

—Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore
order here.

And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice
cried sternly:

—What is the matter?<eos>: 43.23018213319164
What is it now?

Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms
closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his
illdyed head.

Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded
leather of its chairs.<eos>: 61.0533399049588
As on the first day he bargained with me here.
As it was in the beginning, is now.<eos>: 39.30485854326139
On the sideboard the tray of Stuart
coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be.<eos>: 37.03203319543793
And snug in their
spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached
to all the gentiles: world without end.

A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor.<eos>: 71.35726181826377
Blowing out his
rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.

—First, our little financial settlement, he said.

He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong.<eos>: 48.22243019215911
It
slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and
laid them carefully on the table.

—Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.

And now his strongroom for the gold.<eos>: 43.196809853998055
Stephen’s embarrassed hand moved
over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money
cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir’s turban, and
this, the scallop of saint James.<eos>: 38.866475591203034
An old pilgrim’s hoard, dead
treasure, hollow shells.

A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.

—Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.
These are handy things to have.<eos>: 49.742274709812804
See.<eos>: 2.5220783895263676
This is for sovereigns.<eos>: 28.742430243491874
This is
for shillings.<eos>: 74.39973461099788
Sixpences, halfcrowns.<eos>: 3.9779859257146626
And here crowns.<eos>: 88.70518779943284
See.

He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.

—Three twelve, he said.<eos>: 33.32627160688376
I think you’ll find that’s right.

—Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy
haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.

—No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said.<eos>: 28.55184477270086
You have earned it.

Stephen’s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells.<eos>: 30.24662311930373
Symbols too
of beauty and of power.<eos>: 37.817542469355104
A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed
and misery.

—Don’t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said.<eos>: 39.47042726687006
You’ll pull it out somewhere
and lose it.<eos>: 25.435794576951558
You just buy one of these machines.<eos>: 72.2323299721132
You’ll find them very
handy.

Answer something.

—Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.

The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same.<eos>: 93.56681426609255
Three times
now.<eos>: 18.52201806027866
Three nooses round me here.<eos>: 41.635564749935384
Well?<eos>: 4.8242193530921815
I can break them in this instant
if I will.

—Because you don’t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger.<eos>: 28.52419726424499
You don’t
know yet what money is.<eos>: 23.594488022249287
Money is power.<eos>: 22.258867721992946
When you have lived as long as
I have.<eos>: 23.1263469361693
I know, I know.<eos>: 9.260612590965161
If youth but knew.<eos>: 76.18252518047184
But what does Shakespeare
say?<eos>: 41.08421530235283
_Put but money in thy purse._

—Iago, Stephen murmured.

He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare.

—He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said.<eos>: 36.19635106663503
He made money.<eos>: 24.478764261783294
A poet, yes, but
an Englishman too.<eos>: 48.81850200978549
Do you know what is the pride of the English?<eos>: 19.90084699403033
Do you
know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman’s
mouth?

The seas’ ruler.<eos>: 27.289601639436903
His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems
history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.

—That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.

—Ba!<eos>: 57.25498898014098
Mr Deasy cried.<eos>: 8.703736055190923
That’s not English.<eos>: 14.450818068580245
A French Celt said that.<eos>: 35.27247301309045
He
tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.

—I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast.<eos>: 15.261992700469431
_I paid
my way._

Good man, good man.

_—I paid my way.<eos>: 32.75450369801674
I never borrowed a shilling in my life._ Can you feel
that?<eos>: 29.48020736974304
_I owe nothing._ Can you?

Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.
Curran, ten guineas.<eos>: 71.67947289135874
McCann, one guinea.<eos>: 15.03565922697162
Fred Ryan, two shillings.
Temple, two lunches.<eos>: 27.20350753974929
Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob
Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five
weeks’ board.<eos>: 42.22302996347459
The lump I have is useless.

—For the moment, no, Stephen answered.

Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.

—I knew you couldn’t, he said joyously.<eos>: 35.25915710312271
But one day you must feel it.
We are a generous people but we must also be just.

—I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.

Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the
shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of
Wales.

—You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.
I saw three generations since O’Connell’s time.<eos>: 65.79135426987682
I remember the famine
in ’46.<eos>: 55.30107652586527
Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the
union twenty years before O’Connell did or before the prelates of your
communion denounced him as a demagogue?<eos>: 54.0332481997063
You fenians forget some things.

Glorious, pious and immortal memory.<eos>: 114.51229064958656
The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the
splendid behung with corpses of papishes.<eos>: 55.77380536642176
Hoarse, masked and armed, the
planters’ covenant.<eos>: 12.94574951549201
The black north and true blue bible.<eos>: 110.325659574955
Croppies lie
down.

Stephen sketched a brief gesture.

—I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said.<eos>: 45.41578604626589
On the spindle side.<eos>: 9.113191650629403
But
I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union.<eos>: 55.87295808434618
We are
all Irish, all kings’ sons.

—Alas, Stephen said.

—_Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto.<eos>: 25.631162597537728
He voted for
it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to
do so.

     Lal the ral the ra
     The rocky road to Dublin.

A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots.<eos>: 44.9033409808743
Soft day, sir John!
Soft day, your honour!...<eos>: 134.37114569064292
Day!...<eos>: 20.5038248155418
Day!...<eos>: 20.5038248155418
Two topboots jog dangling on
to Dublin.<eos>: 45.8208119152918
Lal the ral the ra.<eos>: 13.945653340273685
Lal the ral the raddy.

—That reminds me, Mr Deasy said.<eos>: 11.595167541144932
You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus,
with some of your literary friends.<eos>: 52.93708910725277
I have a letter here for the press.
Sit down a moment.<eos>: 37.64539155837615
I have just to copy the end.

He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read
off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.

—Sit down.<eos>: 50.42834641366401
Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of
common sense._ Just a moment.

He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow
and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly,
sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.

Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence.<eos>: 63.34689279838357
Framed
around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek
heads poised in air: lord Hastings’ _Repulse_, the duke of
Westminster’s _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort’s _Ceylon_, _prix de
Paris_, 1866.<eos>: 29.003267579799953
Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign.<eos>: 36.29310002175731
He saw their
speeds, backing king’s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished
crowds.

—Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys.<eos>: 54.95355643903951
_But prompt ventilation of this
allimportant question..._

Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the
mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek
of the canteen, over the motley slush.<eos>: 30.090423664816743
Even money _Fair Rebel._ Ten to
one the field.<eos>: 65.55012463628061
Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs,
the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher’s
dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.

Shouts rang shrill from the boys’ playfield and a whirring whistle.

Again: a goal.<eos>: 59.883083630486354
I am among them, among their battling bodies in a
medley, the joust of life.<eos>: 32.34511294650346
You mean that knockkneed mother’s darling
who seems to be slightly crawsick?<eos>: 61.92376265608972
Jousts.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Time shocked rebounds, shock
by shock.<eos>: 41.416310396287585
Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of
the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men’s bloodied guts.

—Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.

He came to the table, pinning together his sheets.<eos>: 24.89095671451296
Stephen stood up.

—I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said.<eos>: 20.88207404189919
It’s about the
foot and mouth disease.<eos>: 21.868070567531664
Just look through it.<eos>: 22.20093780949411
There can be no two
opinions on the matter.

May I trespass on your valuable space.<eos>: 58.660297727985245
That doctrine of _laissez faire_
which so often in our history.<eos>: 38.2015648083115

Pardoned a classical allusion.<eos>: 42.18794729292222
Cassandra.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
By a woman who
was no better than she should be.<eos>: 30.34083108664043
To come to the point at issue.

—I don’t mince words, do I?<eos>: 30.411189663964674
Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.

Foot and mouth disease.<eos>: 69.40629463071853
Known as Koch’s preparation.<eos>: 8.438260629114795
Serum and virus.

Dictates of common sense.<eos>: 31.42603731798426
Allimportant question.<eos>: 11.211828076665586
In
every sense of the word take the bull by the horns.<eos>: 50.08410950433535
Thanking you for
the hospitality of your columns.

—I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said.<eos>: 27.831860666725465
You will see at the
next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle.<eos>: 49.54415756721467
And it can be
cured.<eos>: 37.178724992992706
It is cured.<eos>: 19.677656321269446
My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is
regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there.<eos>: 63.393649521898226
They
offer to come over here.<eos>: 34.072802454156815
I am trying to work up influence with the
department.<eos>: 56.2100345735105
Now I’m going to try publicity.<eos>: 22.166954692363564
I am surrounded by
difficulties, by...<eos>: 30.98478455826476
intrigues by...<eos>: 29.225736564490465
backstairs influence by...

He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.

—Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said.<eos>: 44.53361598041891
England is in the hands of the
jews.<eos>: 14.197018037969203
In all the highest places: her finance, her press.<eos>: 80.0077618990336
And they are
the signs of a nation’s decay.<eos>: 22.091979490511843
Wherever they gather they eat up the
nation’s vital strength.<eos>: 58.228101257674055
I have seen it coming these years.<eos>: 62.146345687511115
As sure as
we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of
destruction.<eos>: 117.5668992166534
Old England is dying.

He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a
broad sunbeam.<eos>: 91.742480735581
He faced about and back again.

—Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.

     The harlot’s cry from street to street
     Shall weave old England’s windingsheet.

His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which
he halted.

—A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or
gentile, is he not?

—They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely.<eos>: 75.01630566711869
And you can see
the darkness in their eyes.<eos>: 30.078426993359262
And that is why they are wanderers on the
earth to this day.

On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting
prices on their gemmed fingers.<eos>: 48.94042441726732
Gabble of geese.<eos>: 16.603552210786145
They swarmed loud,
uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit
silk hats.<eos>: 56.05552754929187
Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures.
Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and
unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their
zeal was vain.<eos>: 130.15590623693907
Vain patience to heap and hoard.<eos>: 52.349102702180275
Time surely would
scatter all.<eos>: 34.531798928750604
A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on.
Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the
dishonours of their flesh.

—Who has not?<eos>: 52.711103898587204
Stephen said.

—What do you mean?<eos>: 9.444319244339543
Mr Deasy asked.

He came forward a pace and stood by the table.<eos>: 21.192992827913017
His underjaw fell
sideways open uncertainly.<eos>: 56.783269493456
Is this old wisdom?<eos>: 42.1664780939428
He waits to hear from
me.

—History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.

From the playfield the boys raised a shout.<eos>: 42.92728699173372
A whirring whistle: goal.
What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?

—The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said.<eos>: 59.49499908779284
All human
history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.

Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:

—That is God.

Hooray!<eos>: 46.34018907982907
Ay!<eos>: 6.8394081481978795
Whrrwhee!

—What?<eos>: 11.729130706493878
Mr Deasy asked.

—A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.

Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked
between his fingers.<eos>: 34.04475874698306
Looking up again he set them free.

—I am happier than you are, he said.<eos>: 26.19936841963314
We have committed many errors and
many sins.<eos>: 92.83115617731586
A woman brought sin into the world.<eos>: 34.14232862579234
For a woman who was no
better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten
years the Greeks made war on Troy.<eos>: 69.02971808370086
A faithless wife first brought the
strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough’s wife and her leman,
O’Rourke, prince of Breffni.<eos>: 37.87969309041885
A woman too brought Parnell low.<eos>: 121.0491978510642
Many
errors, many failures but not the one sin.<eos>: 80.1766051585124
I am a struggler now at the
end of my days.<eos>: 22.384509221899872
But I will fight for the right till the end.

     For Ulster will fight
     And Ulster will be right.

Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.

—Well, sir, he began.

—I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at
this work.<eos>: 49.4940570918438
You were not born to be a teacher, I think.<eos>: 16.489051163901795
Perhaps I am
wrong.

—A learner rather, Stephen said.

And here what will you learn more?

Mr Deasy shook his head.

—Who knows?<eos>: 35.51755506617572
he said.<eos>: 3.492439908750907
To learn one must be humble.<eos>: 74.24468497860069
But life is the great
teacher.

Stephen rustled the sheets again.

—As regards these, he began.

—Yes, Mr Deasy said.<eos>: 20.71470293270348
You have two copies there.<eos>: 42.988207673233866
If you can have them
published at once.

_ Telegraph.<eos>: 35.90686522306417
Irish Homestead._

—I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow.<eos>: 18.15865733674405
I know two
editors slightly.

—That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly.<eos>: 25.12883715682987
I wrote last night to Mr Field,
M.P.<eos>: 60.110454421560036
There is a meeting of the cattletraders’ association today at the
City Arms hotel.<eos>: 29.784034921079865
I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting.<eos>: 53.790351458868
You
see if you can get it into your two papers.<eos>: 32.169301524323984
What are they?

_—The Evening Telegraph..._

—That will do, Mr Deasy said.<eos>: 21.023505621924595
There is no time to lose.<eos>: 27.0679304446431
Now I have to
answer that letter from my cousin.

—Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.
Thank you.

—Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk.<eos>: 27.82495341564005
I
like to break a lance with you, old as I am.

—Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.

He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees,
hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield.<eos>: 39.70356591003896
The
lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate:
toothless terrors.<eos>: 21.619841864719756
Still I will help him in his fight.<eos>: 30.451577245004135
Mulligan will
dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.

—Mr Dedalus!

Running after me.<eos>: 51.2447732700209
No more letters, I hope.

—Just one moment.

—Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.

Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.

—I just wanted to say, he said.<eos>: 25.122019192097515
Ireland, they say, has the honour of
being the only country which never persecuted the jews.<eos>: 53.36200445468677
Do you know
that?<eos>: 8.302629408654257
No.<eos>: 5.3673087592043816
And do you know why?

He frowned sternly on the bright air.

—Why, sir?<eos>: 23.99973740047853
Stephen asked, beginning to smile.

—Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.

A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a
rattling chain of phlegm.<eos>: 49.057358129517176
He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing,
his lifted arms waving to the air.

—She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he
stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path.<eos>: 49.30325441184172
That’s why.

On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung
spangles, dancing coins.

Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and
shells.<eos>: 56.58466896407572
You are walking through it howsomever.<eos>: 29.1230676422979
I am, a stride at a

They came down the steps from Leahy’s terrace prudently,
_Frauenzimmer_: and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed

In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: _euthanasia_.
With beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of
a widowed see, with upstiffed _omophorion_, with clotted hinderparts.

Airs romped round him, nipping and eager airs.<eos>: 40.99510694052893
They are coming, waves.
The whitemaned seahorses, champing, brightwindbridled, the steeds of
Mananaan.

And after?<eos>: 36.21134674377382
The Ship, half

By the way go easy with that money like a good young imbecile.
Yes, I must.

His pace slackened.<eos>: 63.76797123401663
Here.<eos>: 3.107997675956089
Am I going to aunt Sara’s or not?<eos>: 32.31101572866934

Did you see anything of your artist
brother Stephen lately?<eos>: 92.85917151394183
No?<eos>: 7.6288815975081885
Sure he’s not down in Strasburg terrace
with his aunt Sally?<eos>: 25.381755491710877
Couldn’t he fly a bit higher than that, eh?<eos>: 31.335742718797746
And
and and and tell us, Stephen, how is uncle Si?<eos>: 81.85879830836659
O, weeping God, the
things I married into!<eos>: 101.98034499588448
De boys up in de hayloft.<eos>: 48.09549986550893

Highly respectable

And skeweyed Walter sirring his father, no less!<eos>: 44.59492186598382
Sir.<eos>: 5.126673213442302
Yes,
sir.<eos>: 5.073569478673312
No, sir.<eos>: 8.741513829040036
Jesus wept: and no wonder, by Christ!

I pull the wheezy bell of their shuttered cottage: and wait.<eos>: 85.62484195790904
They take
me for a dun, peer out from a coign of vantage.

—It’s Stephen, sir.

—Let him in.<eos>: 25.38136227362472
Let Stephen in.

A bolt drawn back and Walter welcomes me.

—We thought you were someone else.

In his broad bed nuncle Richie, pillowed and blanketed, extends over
the hillock of his knees a sturdy forearm.<eos>: 53.37157771726035
Cleanchested.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
He has washed
the upper moiety.

—Morrow, nephew.

He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for the
eyes of master Goff and master Shapland Tandy, filing consents and
common searches and a writ of _Duces Tecum_.<eos>: 28.70771787714097
A bogoak frame over his
bald head: Wilde’s _Requiescat_.<eos>: 24.575823376383198
The drone of his misleading whistle
brings Walter back.

—Yes, sir?

—Malt for Richie and Stephen, tell mother.<eos>: 57.11118515431808
Where is she?

—Bathing Crissie, sir.

Papa’s little bedpal.<eos>: 27.018378402853543
Lump of love.

—No, uncle Richie...

—Call me Richie.<eos>: 57.980239496091194
Damn your lithia water.<eos>: 16.312842637968327
It lowers.<eos>: 4.777775093538261
Whusky!

—Uncle Richie, really...

—Sit down or by the law Harry I’ll knock you down.

Walter squints vainly for a chair.

—He has nothing to sit down on, sir.

—He has nowhere to put it, you mug.<eos>: 58.58849995624897
Bring in our chippendale chair.
Would you like a bite of something?<eos>: 43.505405529233364
None of your damned lawdeedaw airs
here.<eos>: 49.00681138624441
The rich of a rasher fried with a herring?<eos>: 39.51818109586468
Sure?<eos>: 4.786063797134821
So much the
better.<eos>: 18.659047749143408
We have nothing in the house but backache pills.

_All’erta!_

He drones bars of Ferrando’s _aria di sortita_.<eos>: 27.669168752175985
The grandest number,
Stephen, in the whole opera.<eos>: 35.631265311179014
Listen.

His tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded, with rushes of the
air, his fists bigdrumming on his padded knees.

This wind is sweeter.

Houses of decay, mine, his and all.<eos>: 53.374279627968136
You told the Clongowes gentry you
had an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army.<eos>: 100.19806245297325
Come out of
them, Stephen.<eos>: 18.481944273364142
Beauty is not there.<eos>: 14.13620474298757
Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh’s
library where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas.<eos>: 41.89993816566528
For
whom?<eos>: 14.182276287740617
The hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close.<eos>: 9.924836397346759
A hater of his
kind ran from them to the wood of madness, his mane foaming in the
moon, his eyeballs stars.<eos>: 34.91947847434362
Houyhnhnm, horsenostrilled.<eos>: 3.9779859257146626
The oval equine
faces, Temple, Buck Mulligan, Foxy Campbell, Lanternjaws.<eos>: 31.157670210205378
Abbas father,
furious dean, what offence laid fire to their brains?<eos>: 147.06894669743954
Paff!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
_Descende,
calve, ut ne nimium decalveris_.<eos>: 11.374638777791525
A garland of grey hair on his
comminated head see him me clambering down to the footpace
(_descende!_), clutching a monstrance, basiliskeyed.<eos>: 50.70136562335652
Get down,
baldpoll!<eos>: 15.418809391717758
A choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the
altar’s horns, the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their
albs, tonsured and oiled and gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of
wheat.

And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating
it.<eos>: 42.35877552409934
Dringdring!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
And two streets off another locking it into a pyx.
Dringadring!<eos>: 63.7053038455318
And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own
cheek.<eos>: 40.57828639951482
Dringdring!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
Down, up, forward, back.<eos>: 29.05002669986969
Dan Occam thought of that,
invincible doctor.<eos>: 54.864280000043536
A misty English morning the imp hypostasis tickled
his brain.<eos>: 33.2913062697624
Bringing his host down and kneeling he heard twine with his
second bell the first bell in the transept (he is lifting his) and,
rising, heard (now I am lifting) their two bells (he is kneeling) twang
in diphthong.

Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint.<eos>: 123.32503631508025
Isle of saints.<eos>: 25.59739960592599
You were
awfully holy, weren’t you?<eos>: 38.88903141611993
You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you
might not have a red nose.<eos>: 58.480526393732916
You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue
that the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from
the wet street.<eos>: 86.23212322320434
_O si, certo!_ Sell your soul for that, do, dyed rags
pinned round a squaw.<eos>: 54.14564611223027
More tell me, more still!<eos>: 57.50280955421779
On the top of the Howth
tram alone crying to the rain: _Naked women!<eos>: 57.86447703575462
Naked women!_ What about
that, eh?

What about what?<eos>: 46.08911336498874
What else were they invented for?

Reading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh?<eos>: 173.21488907624374
I was young.
You bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause
earnestly, striking face.<eos>: 100.56524980231906
Hurray for the Goddamned idiot!<eos>: 21.81000589948519
Hray!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
No-one
saw: tell no-one.<eos>: 96.21630226360968
Books you were going to write with letters for
titles.<eos>: 48.316546500422746
Have you read his F?<eos>: 57.55501004866516
O yes, but I prefer Q.<eos>: 14.220561939042785
Yes, but W is
wonderful.<eos>: 59.79368917035505
O yes, W.<eos>: 11.861067006615102
Remember your epiphanies written on green oval
leaves, deeply deep, copies to be sent if you died to all the great
libraries of the world, including Alexandria?<eos>: 104.70203265994695
Someone was to read them
there after a few thousand years, a mahamanvantara.<eos>: 38.17622623658782
Pico della
Mirandola like.<eos>: 13.308509229092488
Ay, very like a whale.<eos>: 14.341041411596194
When one reads these strange
pages of one long gone one feels that one is at one with one who
once...

The grainy sand had gone from under his feet.<eos>: 187.56644787808278
His boots trod again a
damp crackling mast, razorshells, squeaking pebbles, that on the
unnumbered pebbles beats, wood sieved by the shipworm, lost Armada.
Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing
upward sewage breath, a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a
midden of man’s ashes.<eos>: 52.48031187395247
He coasted them, walking warily.<eos>: 30.782833787289057
A porterbottle
stood up, stogged to its waist, in the cakey sand dough.<eos>: 21.684525524650194
A sentinel:
isle of dreadful thirst.<eos>: 43.272232860287744
Broken hoops on the shore; at the land a maze
of dark cunning nets; farther away chalkscrawled backdoors and on the
higher beach a dryingline with two crucified shirts.<eos>: 71.99978374935057
Ringsend: wigwams
of brown steersmen and master mariners.<eos>: 20.171844720772704
Human shells.

He halted.<eos>: 19.669555334051218
I have passed the way to aunt Sara’s.<eos>: 26.7838038678972
Am I not going there?
Seems not.<eos>: 43.30423626286838
No-one about.<eos>: 30.652982593701456
He turned northeast and crossed the firmer

He is running back to them.<eos>: 20.597273921471928
Who?

Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their
bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf.<eos>: 42.63406137573768
Dane vikings,
torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the
collar of gold.<eos>: 49.23847404259016
A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon,
spouting, hobbling in the shallows.<eos>: 18.764137029379004

Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves.<eos>: 42.326372827723105
I moved
among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the
spluttering resin fires.<eos>: 52.30316981397797
I spoke to no-one: none to me.

The dog’s bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back.<eos>: 54.03898187107314
Dog of my enemy.<eos>: 17.84978504553931

Who’s behind me?<eos>: 9.36237408558564
Out quickly, quickly!<eos>: 30.87522406140722
Do you see the tide flowing
quickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly,

I...<eos>: 13.649750072430631
With him together down...<eos>: 96.21507186648564
I could not
save her.<eos>: 23.870005736279726
Waters: bitter death: lost.

I see her skirties.<eos>: 9.57062149678024
Pinned up, I bet.

Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on
all sides.<eos>: 53.22635373535012
Looking for something lost in a past life.<eos>: 37.89710505287368
Suddenly he made
off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a
lowskimming gull.<eos>: 70.1494732758419
The man’s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears.<eos>: 39.631856810883036
He
turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks.<eos>: 42.00898417059257
On a
field tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired.<eos>: 30.686012743384246

the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears.<eos>: 24.85457578443253
His snout
lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse.<eos>: 13.46328982695417
They serpented
towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth,
breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.

Cocklepickers.<eos>: 66.2215307861764
They waded a little way in the water and, stooping,
soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out.<eos>: 32.49712855889554
The dog yelped
running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again
reared up at them with mute bearish fawning.<eos>: 47.484605330185424
Unheeded he kept by them
as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf’s tongue redpanting
from his jaws.<eos>: 35.76663557342108
His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped
off at a calf’s gallop.<eos>: 37.277177435124194
The carcass lay on his path.<eos>: 16.165358053980317
He stopped,
sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it,
sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog’s bedraggled fell.
Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal.<eos>: 41.99983142445693
Ah,
poor dogsbody!<eos>: 8.971170682720043
Here lies poor dogsbody’s body.

—Tatters!<eos>: 26.378668420264223
Out of that, you mongrel!

The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless
kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight.<eos>: 65.16916817601181
He
slunk back in a curve.<eos>: 21.304107814411083
Doesn’t see me.<eos>: 5.239898770864447
Along by the edge of the mole he
lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed
against it.<eos>: 46.62500343296496
He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed
quick short at an unsmelt rock.<eos>: 62.99611652115561
The simple pleasures of the poor.<eos>: 73.46348746911423
His
hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved.
Something he buried there, his grandmother.<eos>: 35.84353735701997
He rooted in the sand,
dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand
again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in
spousebreach, vulturing the dead.

After he woke me last night same dream or was it?<eos>: 54.194657708888805
Wait.<eos>: 2.366011761982759
Open hallway.
Street of harlots.<eos>: 44.24541315236895
Remember.<eos>: 3.1573504967419153
Haroun al Raschid.<eos>: 3.3831009326705948
I am almosting it.<eos>: 8.815121252721706
That
man led me, spoke.<eos>: 34.91843156439304
I was not afraid.<eos>: 12.178002444668074
The melon he had he held against
my face.<eos>: 33.66265367088257
Smiled: creamfruit smell.<eos>: 13.754807995119474
That was the rule, said.<eos>: 29.015129530311807
In.<eos>: 7.669899004745134
Come.
Red carpet spread.<eos>: 69.9246809340606
You will see who.

Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians.<eos>: 30.981257864478636
His blued feet
out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler
strangling his unshaven neck.<eos>: 25.032298535570625
With woman steps she followed: the
ruffian and his strolling mort.<eos>: 61.77141867828616
Spoils slung at her back.<eos>: 57.067160364566135
Loose sand
and shellgrit crusted her bare feet.<eos>: 32.496864046010025
About her windraw face hair
trailed.<eos>: 36.92483406484216
Behind her lord, his helpmate, bing awast to Romeville.<eos>: 13.35759358982381
When
night hides her body’s flaws calling under her brown shawl from an
archway where dogs have mired.<eos>: 92.74888446638593
Her fancyman is treating two Royal
Dublins in O’Loughlin’s of Blackpitts.<eos>: 21.158598749486064
Buss her, wap in rogues’ rum
lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell!<eos>: 29.94177123204943
A shefiend’s whiteness under her
rancid rags.<eos>: 11.075263014807916
Fumbally’s lane that night: the tanyard smells.

     White thy fambles, red thy gan
     And thy quarrons dainty is.
     Couch a hogshead with me then.
     In the darkmans clip and kiss.

Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, _frate porcospino_.
Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted.<eos>: 56.521977753200936
Call away let him: _thy quarrons
dainty is_.<eos>: 44.778560399558664
Language no whit worse than his.<eos>: 42.62804862271226
Monkwords, marybeads
jabber on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their
pockets.

Passing now.

A side eye at my Hamlet hat.<eos>: 71.14996583701814
If I were suddenly naked here as I sit?<eos>: 136.933524108202
I
am not.<eos>: 8.669168431969265
Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun’s
flaming sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands.<eos>: 45.825851234320105
She trudges,
schlepps, trains, drags, trascines her load.<eos>: 7.151939452584779
A tide westering,
moondrawn, in her wake.<eos>: 23.04749968025061
Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not
mine, _oinopa ponton_, a winedark sea.<eos>: 33.8938451461855
Behold the handmaid of the moon.
In sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise.<eos>: 52.124324403625806
Bridebed,
childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled.<eos>: 13.089082871418944
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.<eos>: 15.629922671870709
He
comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying
the sea, mouth to her mouth’s kiss.

Here.<eos>: 68.64296615756679
Put a pin in that chap, will you?<eos>: 34.295995143426886
My tablets.<eos>: 3.716692993441936
Mouth to her kiss.
No.<eos>: 30.55442076546244
Must be two of em.<eos>: 36.59278403002533
Glue em well.<eos>: 34.59819449279889
Mouth to her mouth’s kiss.

His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb.
Oomb, allwombing tomb.<eos>: 28.814571483665937
His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched:
ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring
wayawayawayawayaway.<eos>: 24.693701570200165
Paper.<eos>: 1.9515045490863507
The banknotes, blast them.<eos>: 18.372534514678883
Old Deasy’s
letter.<eos>: 14.77279389135279
Here.<eos>: 3.107997675956089
Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off.
Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and
scribbled words.<eos>: 128.1346550044757
That’s twice I forgot to take slips from the library
counter.

His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending.<eos>: 89.31118006757627
Why not endless till
the farthest star?<eos>: 35.87920248963403
Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness
shining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds.<eos>: 98.4512729466048
Me sits there
with his augur’s rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid
sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth
stars.<eos>: 76.64816506888673
I throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it
back.<eos>: 114.45847719814579
Endless, would it be mine, form of my form?<eos>: 59.46629042869645
Who watches me here?
Who ever anywhere will read these written words?<eos>: 158.56575372641743
Signs on a white
field.<eos>: 23.539038970008146
Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice.<eos>: 30.975284243461783
The good bishop of
Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space
with coloured emblems hatched on its field.<eos>: 63.336336723122336
Hold hard.<eos>: 10.788983369466465
Coloured on a
flat: yes, that’s right.<eos>: 24.16896690563947
Flat I see, then think distance, near, far,
flat I see, east, back.<eos>: 162.7898470990837
Ah, see now!<eos>: 20.93110231719227
Falls back suddenly, frozen in
stereoscope.<eos>: 74.47445420278585
Click does the trick.<eos>: 26.81764312847612
You find my words dark.<eos>: 82.03395432205158
Darkness is
in our souls do you not think?<eos>: 59.546967803288524
Flutier.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Our souls, shamewounded by our
sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the
more.

She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes.<eos>: 86.08043818593643
Now where the blue
hell am I bringing her beyond the veil?<eos>: 238.97510932644565
Into the ineluctable modality
of the ineluctable visuality.<eos>: 11.810627847343122
She, she, she.<eos>: 31.767539692179458
What she?<eos>: 11.188308044921142
The virgin at
Hodges Figgis’ window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet
books you were going to write.<eos>: 71.61101883870202
Keen glance you gave her.<eos>: 61.368079208778
Wrist through
the braided jesse of her sunshade.<eos>: 15.644985371972009
She lives in Leeson park with a
grief and kickshaws, a lady of letters.<eos>: 39.07096830175942
Talk that to someone else,
Stevie: a pickmeup.<eos>: 27.783470957817638
Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders
and yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool.<eos>: 65.5327046749787
Talk about apple
dumplings, _piuttosto_.<eos>: 19.235116785912005
Where are your wits?

Touch me.<eos>: 36.104538429682925
Soft eyes.<eos>: 11.953342823622085
Soft soft soft hand.<eos>: 56.96943864766324
I am lonely here.<eos>: 26.686242661995642
O, touch me
soon, now.<eos>: 39.126922203376836
What is that word known to all men?<eos>: 39.51513298197671
I am quiet here alone.
Sad too.<eos>: 85.68746743691321
Touch, touch me.

He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the
scribbled note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his
eyes.<eos>: 65.32384965685473
That is Kevin Egan’s movement I made, nodding for his nap,
sabbath sleep.<eos>: 79.55679092757767
_Et vidit Deus.<eos>: 2.332577538923788
Et erant valde bona_.<eos>: 2.5886089713672646
Alo!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
_Bonjour_.
Welcome as the flowers in May.<eos>: 94.03550003400322
Under its leaf he watched through
peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun.<eos>: 28.447327676353254
I am caught in this burning
scene.<eos>: 72.58281284964228
Pan’s hour, the faunal noon.<eos>: 16.54971175026
Among gumheavy serpentplants,
milkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide.<eos>: 92.57990715903142
Pain is
far.

     And no more turn aside and brood.

His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck’s castoffs,
_nebeneinander_.<eos>: 45.074783783649835
He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein
another’s foot had nested warm.<eos>: 77.97314953342442
The foot that beat the ground in
tripudium, foot I dislove.<eos>: 61.45852536456097
But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt’s
shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris.<eos>: 93.88716896227513
_Tiens, quel petit pied!_
Staunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde’s love that dare not speak its
name.<eos>: 47.03249619648392
His arm: Cranly’s arm.<eos>: 21.50931978643666
He now will leave me.<eos>: 31.018939484865324
And the blame?<eos>: 33.02597044797508
As I
am.<eos>: 14.075781817142841
As I am.<eos>: 14.075781817142841
All or not at all.

In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering
greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing.<eos>: 80.34847602324086
My ashplant will float
away.<eos>: 71.59723441346208
I shall wait.<eos>: 16.251938662695146
No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the
low rocks, swirling, passing.<eos>: 72.08021377968711
Better get this job over quick.<eos>: 59.33167747217526
Listen: a
fourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos.<eos>: 4.755819488553541
Vehement breath of
waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks.<eos>: 57.74714989617986
In cups of rocks it
slops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels.<eos>: 31.907863305733525
And, spent, its speech
ceases.<eos>: 68.6365977275065
It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower
unfurling.

Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and
sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water
swaying and upturning coy silver fronds.<eos>: 67.93666829836503
Day by day: night by night:
lifted, flooded and let fall.<eos>: 109.2167782708303
Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to,
they sigh.<eos>: 126.85599509016575
Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting,
awaiting the fullness of their times, _diebus ac noctibus iniurias
patiens ingemiscit_.<eos>: 30.267786151082362
To no end gathered; vainly then released,
forthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon.<eos>: 34.064362278204946
Weary too in sight of
lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws
a toil of waters.

Five fathoms out there.<eos>: 77.00816443319461
Full fathom five thy father lies.<eos>: 63.856717299992056
At one, he
said.<eos>: 6.234546548324018
Found drowned.<eos>: 16.75865682094401
High water at Dublin bar.<eos>: 44.518658033982504
Driving before it a
loose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells.<eos>: 39.1441120369249
A corpse
rising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise
landward.<eos>: 26.910764243756052
There he is.<eos>: 9.414934193496887
Hook it quick.<eos>: 18.425679339453787
Pull.<eos>: 6.735652951977699
Sunk though he be beneath
the watery floor.<eos>: 50.233309036386636
We have him.<eos>: 11.835061920273704
Easy now.

Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine.<eos>: 30.142280986380445
A quiver of minnows, fat of a
spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly.<eos>: 17.60836303582974
God
becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed
mountain.<eos>: 132.6211421474672
Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a
urinous offal from all dead.<eos>: 122.86065988820685
Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes
upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to
the sun.

A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue.<eos>: 47.98237707595362
Seadeath, mildest of all deaths
known to man.<eos>: 39.870319922518235
Old Father Ocean.<eos>: 26.037978873944784
_Prix de Paris_: beware of imitations.
Just you give it a fair trial.<eos>: 30.007181898457503
We enjoyed ourselves immensely.

Come.<eos>: 60.369169140759375
I thirst.<eos>: 14.729491393445086
Clouding over.<eos>: 12.518482132201957
No black clouds anywhere, are there?
Thunderstorm.<eos>: 98.44592011709685
Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect,
_Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum_.<eos>: 32.12177490643944
No.<eos>: 5.3673087592043816
My cockle hat and staff and
hismy sandal shoon.<eos>: 16.781494820972362
Where?<eos>: 4.213136859000814
To evening lands.<eos>: 39.21552535605233
Evening will find itself.

He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying
still.<eos>: 35.2272863326565
Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me.<eos>: 68.30067493121767
All days make
their end.<eos>: 108.46109724689349
By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day.
Of all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum.<eos>: 84.60185071405306
Lawn

Toothless Kinch,

Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?

My handkerchief.<eos>: 98.8303944673526
He threw it.<eos>: 17.971059614309436
I remember.<eos>: 9.626315617604796
Did I not take it up?

His hand groped vainly in his pockets.<eos>: 22.63907801392029
No, I didn’t.<eos>: 10.517364067327287
Better buy one.

He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock,
carefully.<eos>: 40.96029483769541
For the rest let look who will.

Behind.<eos>: 197.86711365166
Perhaps there is someone.

He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant.<eos>: 43.096271521216565
Moving through the
air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the
crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.

[ 4 ]

Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.
He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart,
liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods’ roes.<eos>: 41.72231557907224
Most of all he
liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of
faintly scented urine.

Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting
her breakfast things on the humpy tray.<eos>: 64.59304415255356
Gelid light and air were in the
kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere.<eos>: 100.94960720998657
Made him
feel a bit peckish.

The coals were reddening.

Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right.<eos>: 55.39126361458372
She didn’t like
her plate full.<eos>: 34.895749842633805
Right.<eos>: 12.300255453267342
He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off
the hob and set it sideways on the fire.<eos>: 43.964189263368844
It sat there, dull and squat,
its spout stuck out.<eos>: 44.20100750774784
Cup of tea soon.<eos>: 59.422050494815466
Good.<eos>: 5.7636952636093595
Mouth dry.<eos>: 14.116324497129423
The cat walked
stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.

—Mkgnao!

—O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.

The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the
table, mewing.<eos>: 29.001333604775652
Just how she stalks over my writingtable.<eos>: 25.635890320660167

Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form.<eos>: 50.41692065354935
Clean to see:
the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her
tail, the green flashing eyes.<eos>: 53.24511743358177
He bent down to her, his hands on his
knees.

—Milk for the pussens, he said.

—Mrkgnao!<eos>: 19.612066597410344
the cat cried.

They call them stupid.<eos>: 54.87650131703469
They understand what we say better than we
understand them.<eos>: 71.31808665081041
She understands all she wants to.<eos>: 36.66604220055621
Vindictive too.
Cruel.<eos>: 36.95713085927093
Her nature.<eos>: 16.859747883741132
Curious mice never squeal.<eos>: 16.77788489482941
Seem to like it.<eos>: 9.457839495071761
Wonder
what I look like to her.<eos>: 32.12109371665162
Height of a tower?<eos>: 23.894400560814667
No, she can jump me.

—Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly.<eos>: 25.934970921263726
Afraid of the
chookchooks.<eos>: 5.2339952216010355
I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.

—Mrkrgnao!<eos>: 23.01283710503171
the cat said loudly.

She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively
and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth.<eos>: 38.468100318237305
He watched the dark eyeslits
narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones.<eos>: 71.00484134047397
Then he went to
the dresser, took the jug Hanlon’s milkman had just filled for him,
poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.

—Gurrhr!<eos>: 46.81724536551683
she cried, running to lap.

He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped
three times and licked lightly.<eos>: 55.90078154714262
Wonder is it true if you clip them they
can’t mouse after.<eos>: 44.00017866998625
Why?<eos>: 4.396144867849921
They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips.<eos>: 25.40192946370281
Or
kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.

He listened to her licking lap.<eos>: 48.854244256060156
Ham and eggs, no.<eos>: 21.864096964429546
No good eggs with
this drouth.<eos>: 68.04014099975413
Want pure fresh water.<eos>: 49.83365761776722
Thursday: not a good day either for
a mutton kidney at Buckley’s.<eos>: 41.97457749078866
Fried with butter, a shake of pepper.
Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz’s.<eos>: 71.69670385643812
While the kettle is boiling.<eos>: 29.22698335795969
She
lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean.<eos>: 29.150535503565727
Why are their tongues so
rough?<eos>: 98.84208175291765
To lap better, all porous holes.<eos>: 82.97108812215343
Nothing she can eat?<eos>: 48.822253162831025
He glanced
round him.<eos>: 22.400261782361444
No.

On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by
the bedroom door.<eos>: 70.15257049859403
She might like something tasty.<eos>: 21.178647949284905
Thin bread and butter
she likes in the morning.<eos>: 53.40900225133274
Still perhaps: once in a way.

He said softly in the bare hall:

—I’m going round the corner.<eos>: 39.122286211071774
Be back in a minute.

And when he had heard his voice say it he added:

—You don’t want anything for breakfast?

A sleepy soft grunt answered:

—Mn.

No.<eos>: 65.60338267126087
She didn’t want anything.<eos>: 9.505341871824319
He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer,
as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.
Must get those settled really.<eos>: 113.79148663476848
Pity.<eos>: 2.5276301759608875
All the way from Gibraltar.
Forgotten any little Spanish she knew.<eos>: 88.46799174317
Wonder what her father gave for
it.<eos>: 43.03770034725151
Old style.<eos>: 13.752413420431044
Ah yes!<eos>: 11.563389486858982
of course.<eos>: 11.522910931874808
Bought it at the governor’s auction.
Got a short knock.<eos>: 40.844240328501
Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy.<eos>: 100.85963761781107
Yes, sir.<eos>: 5.073569478673312
At
Plevna that was.<eos>: 11.414162453149025
I rose from the ranks, sir, and I’m proud of it.<eos>: 26.8162540120834
Still
he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps.<eos>: 73.56836665738616
Now that was
farseeing.

His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat
and his lost property office secondhand waterproof.<eos>: 52.57103685834336
Stamps: stickyback
pictures.<eos>: 16.567954227623453
Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too.<eos>: 87.71522006492867
Course they do.
The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto’s
high grade ha.<eos>: 39.9356603789964
He peeped quickly inside the leather headband.<eos>: 35.61672622364046
White
slip of paper.<eos>: 20.207707622231723
Quite safe.

On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey.<eos>: 30.091717767403917
Not there.
In the trousers I left off.<eos>: 49.575615164109536
Must get it.<eos>: 6.616510645239779
Potato I have.<eos>: 16.5789100497866
Creaky
wardrobe.<eos>: 2.842387380473868
No use disturbing her.<eos>: 17.46676174736453
She turned over sleepily that time.<eos>: 29.944734642494666
He
pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf
dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid.<eos>: 64.92170891320445
Looked shut.<eos>: 16.50683890417204
All right
till I come back anyhow.

He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number
seventyfive.<eos>: 40.79943859426976
The sun was nearing the steeple of George’s church.<eos>: 14.682294029126957
Be a
warm day I fancy.<eos>: 66.53384809591188
Specially in these black clothes feel it more.<eos>: 110.32132831951878
Black
conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat.<eos>: 38.013812057578555
But I couldn’t go in
that light suit.<eos>: 22.448131155731957
Make a picnic of it.<eos>: 17.610165538492247
His eyelids sank quietly often as
he walked in happy warmth.<eos>: 162.0937416350899
Boland’s breadvan delivering with trays our
daily but she prefers yesterday’s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.
Makes you feel young.<eos>: 78.61899653374039
Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at
dawn.<eos>: 52.11689097698798
Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day’s march on him.
Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically.<eos>: 67.22380183013419
Walk along a
strand, strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker
too, old Tweedy’s big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear.
Wander through awned streets.<eos>: 68.9446785558198
Turbaned faces going by.<eos>: 144.94063435818205
Dark caves of
carpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking
a coiled pipe.<eos>: 56.64482198009976
Cries of sellers in the streets.<eos>: 10.643389278266584
Drink water scented
with fennel, sherbet.<eos>: 43.48617778707167
Dander along all day.<eos>: 32.63101409333815
Might meet a robber or two.
Well, meet him.<eos>: 63.45142908333592
Getting on to sundown.<eos>: 8.205417293847724
The shadows of the mosques among
the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up.<eos>: 59.85748679514993
A shiver of the trees,
signal, the evening wind.<eos>: 31.97799648303324
I pass on.<eos>: 15.145268591943214
Fading gold sky.<eos>: 47.94741935917636
A mother watches
me from her doorway.<eos>: 44.902781074275055
She calls her children home in their dark
language.<eos>: 78.89319411200893
High wall: beyond strings twanged.<eos>: 58.61292042101446
Night sky, moon, violet,
colour of Molly’s new garters.<eos>: 62.90807216523062
Strings.<eos>: 2.3413742622786216
Listen.<eos>: 1.4273104182682907
A girl playing one of
those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers.<eos>: 44.296154881393356
I pass.

Probably not a bit like it really.<eos>: 41.11632451328738
Kind of stuff you read: in the track
of the sun.<eos>: 33.80948246477819
Sunburst on the titlepage.<eos>: 4.398156850102428
He smiled, pleasing himself.
What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_
leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway
behind the bank of Ireland.<eos>: 43.15261322413739
He prolonged his pleased smile.<eos>: 125.90732051250619
Ikey touch
that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.

He approached Larry O’Rourke’s.<eos>: 46.096982669138725
From the cellar grating floated up the
flabby gush of porter.<eos>: 16.620802614599857
Through the open doorway the bar squirted out
whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush.<eos>: 33.07077778122559
Good house, however: just the
end of the city traffic.<eos>: 41.46038360808881
For instance M’Auley’s down there: n.<eos>: 51.54616117893885
g.<eos>: 1.812389059909156
as
position.<eos>: 20.461633336557668
Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular
from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.

Baldhead over the blind.<eos>: 83.41857783254602
Cute old codger.<eos>: 7.888238467392258
No use canvassing him for an
ad.<eos>: 28.94096631378295
Still he knows his own business best.<eos>: 52.82531765605911
There he is, sure enough, my
bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching
the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket.<eos>: 55.90467675266685
Simon Dedalus takes him
off to a tee with his eyes screwed up.<eos>: 53.36939461455521
Do you know what I’m going to
tell you?<eos>: 10.038608604037043
What’s that, Mr O’Rourke?<eos>: 11.281480193930767
Do you know what?<eos>: 7.032668157650424
The Russians,
they’d only be an eight o’clock breakfast for the Japanese.

Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps.<eos>: 69.72962743006656
Sad thing about poor
Dignam, Mr O’Rourke.

Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the
doorway:

—Good day, Mr O’Rourke.

—Good day to you.

—Lovely weather, sir.

—’Tis all that.

Where do they get the money?<eos>: 37.82881828325465
Coming up redheaded curates from the
county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar.<eos>: 15.333946716456515
Then, lo and
behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons.<eos>: 92.96757691537948
Then think
of the competition.<eos>: 23.34591354485091
General thirst.<eos>: 12.553437687194224
Good puzzle would be cross Dublin
without passing a pub.<eos>: 143.56818903258377
Save it they can’t.<eos>: 14.639448596143778
Off the drunks perhaps.<eos>: 9.715565060636962
Put
down three and carry five.<eos>: 66.54406459137839
What is that, a bob here and there, dribs
and drabs.<eos>: 25.67538867930539
On the wholesale orders perhaps.<eos>: 68.6739339311291
Doing a double shuffle with
the town travellers.<eos>: 16.920187292286393
Square it you with the boss and we’ll split the
job, see?

How much would that tot to off the porter in the month?<eos>: 94.00330322632746
Say ten barrels
of stuff.<eos>: 37.476575403531
Say he got ten per cent off.<eos>: 68.96863961446795
O more.<eos>: 11.088605635179354
Fifteen.<eos>: 13.281448911780984
He passed Saint
Joseph’s National school.<eos>: 41.472974961107354
Brats’ clamour.<eos>: 7.784982074276408
Windows open.<eos>: 11.232952809632872
Fresh air helps

Slieve Bloom.

He halted before Dlugacz’s window, staring at the hanks of sausages,
polonies, black and white.<eos>: 29.44682397324267
Fifteen multiplied by.<eos>: 38.457277828828175
The figures whitened
in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade.<eos>: 30.879201978326815
The shiny links,
packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the
lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs’ blood.

A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last.<eos>: 60.015600760152594
He
stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter.<eos>: 27.487366850533952
Would she buy it too,
calling the items from a slip in her hand?<eos>: 55.88430467801755
Chapped: washingsoda.<eos>: 7.143657221749682
And a
pound and a half of Denny’s sausages.<eos>: 25.401592177068483
His eyes rested on her vigorous
hips.<eos>: 30.480641996811976
Woods his name is.<eos>: 14.926411565063884
Wonder what he does.<eos>: 11.258779459483645
Wife is oldish.<eos>: 8.195239119715524
New
blood.<eos>: 12.126580430596665
No followers allowed.<eos>: 19.987804995211935
Strong pair of arms.<eos>: 26.055669640669585
Whacking a carpet on
the clothesline.<eos>: 15.233273815652993
She does whack it, by George.<eos>: 88.59315217737758
The way her crooked
skirt swings at each whack.

The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with
blotchy fingers, sausagepink.<eos>: 58.05261548232138
Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.

He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at
Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias.<eos>: 50.77308109901435
Can become ideal winter
sanatorium.<eos>: 80.53605570641419
Moses Montefiore.<eos>: 4.399526669063286
I thought he was.<eos>: 8.560078064804815
Farmhouse, wall round
it, blurred cattle cropping.<eos>: 34.02461604197544
He held the page from him: interesting:
read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page
rustling.<eos>: 64.81615377015368
A young white heifer.<eos>: 17.341221138495378
Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the
beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the
breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a
palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there’s a prime one, unpeeled
switches in their hands.<eos>: 31.397744590755586
He held the page aslant patiently, bending his
senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest.<eos>: 86.37519014679982
The crooked skirt
swinging, whack by whack by whack.

The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime
sausages and made a red grimace.

—Now, my miss, he said.

She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.

—Thank you, my miss.<eos>: 71.40688280723175
And one shilling threepence change.<eos>: 156.6361365908084
For you,
please?

Mr Bloom pointed quickly.<eos>: 23.492796651573475
To catch up and walk behind her if she went
slowly, behind her moving hams.<eos>: 81.58857268410655
Pleasant to see first thing in the
morning.<eos>: 31.415837365728915
Hurry up, damn it.<eos>: 18.609222311868486
Make hay while the sun shines.<eos>: 58.69213543668349
She stood
outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right.<eos>: 29.890024677021092
He
sighed down his nose: they never understand.<eos>: 62.360137388402734
Sodachapped hands.<eos>: 9.459166799268495
Crusted
toenails too.<eos>: 8.155572835292013
Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways.<eos>: 26.095869736951673
The
sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast.<eos>: 33.49717514398656
For
another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles’ Lane.<eos>: 198.09615732173148
They like
them sizeable.<eos>: 16.149877843312225
Prime sausage.<eos>: 2.308084599439445
O please, Mr Policeman, I’m lost in the
wood.

—Threepence, please.

His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.
Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers’ pocket and laid them
on the rubber prickles.<eos>: 62.20375891329517
They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid,
disc by disc, into the till.

—Thank you, sir.<eos>: 81.290749400033
Another time.

A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him.<eos>: 45.91664853629966
He withdrew his gaze
after an instant.<eos>: 23.71027744351542
No: better not: another time.

—Good morning, he said, moving away.

—Good morning, sir.

No sign.<eos>: 36.32353373525462
Gone.<eos>: 1.4412035960954581
What matter?

He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely.<eos>: 31.92485358290552
Agendath Netaim:
planters’ company.<eos>: 47.738076644727236
To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish
government and plant with eucalyptus trees.<eos>: 124.82190448677774
Excellent for shade, fuel
and construction.<eos>: 15.800733921827447
Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa.
You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with
olives, oranges, almonds or citrons.<eos>: 68.07547718306516
Olives cheaper: oranges need
artificial irrigation.<eos>: 59.63220621045706
Every year you get a sending of the crop.<eos>: 88.31169876899835
Your
name entered for life as owner in the book of the union.<eos>: 65.30051770788161
Can pay ten
down and the balance in yearly instalments.<eos>: 36.82888708382129
Bleibtreustrasse 34,
Berlin, W.<eos>: 5.298135131529813
15.

Nothing doing.<eos>: 91.48705098786942
Still an idea behind it.

He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat.<eos>: 42.50522828570235
Silverpowdered
olivetrees.<eos>: 2.842387380473868
Quiet long days: pruning, ripening.<eos>: 20.134070539515125
Olives are packed in
jars, eh?<eos>: 39.40798343722077
I have a few left from Andrews.<eos>: 28.19091757315349
Molly spitting them out.
Knows the taste of them now.<eos>: 59.09603139078817
Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates.
Citrons too.<eos>: 41.41069387911813
Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin’s parade.<eos>: 64.86488111594504
And
Mastiansky with the old cither.<eos>: 27.57335032588617
Pleasant evenings we had then.<eos>: 72.13457898036536
Molly in
Citron’s basketchair.<eos>: 8.90846575448527
Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand,
lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume.<eos>: 104.45181528040531
Like that, heavy, sweet,
wild perfume.<eos>: 75.35960185742606
Always the same, year after year.<eos>: 69.40005509607953
They fetched high

old times.<eos>: 43.644295603604355
Must be without a flaw, he said.<eos>: 9.00052200816068
Coming all that way: Spain,
Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant.<eos>: 24.786829953532703
Crates lined up on the quayside
at Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them

Doesn’t see.<eos>: 4.9671344568597355
Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore.<eos>: 115.1195922644084
His back
is like that Norwegian captain’s.<eos>: 26.558849995761857
Wonder if I’ll meet him today.
Watering cart.<eos>: 19.765778467203763
To provoke the rain.<eos>: 9.091645333830938
On earth as it is in heaven.

A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly.<eos>: 42.68385531613504
Grey.<eos>: 6.82367644141506
Far.

No, not like that.<eos>: 33.96020146192256
A barren land, bare waste.<eos>: 54.68449632913995
Vulcanic lake, the dead
sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth.<eos>: 59.091560310676336
No wind could lift
those waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters.<eos>: 83.04106447343565
Brimstone they called

A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old.<eos>: 74.63293287697944
Old now.<eos>: 13.701373362475405
It bore
the oldest, the first race.<eos>: 24.517748352443412
A bent hag crossed from Cassidy’s,
clutching a naggin bottle by the neck.<eos>: 55.134139823255545
The oldest people.<eos>: 9.709334013527691
Wandered far
away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying,
being born everywhere.<eos>: 38.05204560342335
It lay there now.<eos>: 24.65256502378442
Now it could bear no more.
Dead: an old woman’s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.

Desolation.

Grey horror seared his flesh.<eos>: 54.77128115750266
Folding the page into his pocket he
turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward.<eos>: 21.049913643472628
Cold oils slid along his
veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak.<eos>: 148.2827822261592
Well, I
am here now.<eos>: 15.639390823467668
Yes, I am here now.<eos>: 14.39034664683743
Morning mouth bad images.<eos>: 126.28867480947741

Valuation is only twentyeight.<eos>: 85.2266017845024
Towers, Battersby, North,
MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills.<eos>: 46.87765439219723
Plasters on a sore
eye.<eos>: 20.608601540294835
To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling
butter.<eos>: 52.53528406349446
Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh.<eos>: 49.92009844133541
Yes, yes.

Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim
sandals, along the brightening footpath.<eos>: 56.21790958821167
Runs, she runs to meet me, a
girl with gold hair on the wind.

Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor.<eos>: 44.29881690577725
He stooped and gathered
them.<eos>: 82.65192463531139
Mrs Marion Bloom.<eos>: 11.753490238271832
His quickened heart slowed at once.<eos>: 21.198275244516296
Bold hand.
Mrs Marion.

—Poldy!

Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm
yellow twilight towards her tousled head.

—Who are the letters for?

He looked at them.<eos>: 79.24479918992057
Mullingar.<eos>: 6.786078824955127
Milly.

—A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you.<eos>: 47.407056887011656
And
a letter for you.

He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of
her knees.

—Do you want the blind up?

Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her
glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.

—That do?<eos>: 59.99633836418713
he asked, turning.

She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.

—She got the things, she said.

He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back
slowly with a snug sigh.

—Hurry up with that tea, she said.<eos>: 54.239697987185764
I’m parched.

—The kettle is boiling, he said.

But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled
linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.

As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:

—Poldy!

—What?

—Scald the teapot.

On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout.<eos>: 58.3713378192095
He scalded
and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting
the kettle then to let the water flow in.<eos>: 75.67674289479474
Having set it to draw he took
off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the
lump of butter slide and melt.<eos>: 97.4972458332185
While he unwrapped the kidney the cat
mewed hungrily against him.<eos>: 37.222186408312865
Give her too much meat she won’t mouse.<eos>: 31.205011876442626
Say
they won’t eat pork.<eos>: 25.36800460258194
Kosher.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Here.<eos>: 3.107997675956089
He let the bloodsmeared paper fall
to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce.<eos>: 87.85230581985796
Pepper.
He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.

Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over.<eos>: 33.734878069499516
Thanks:
new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan’s
seaside girls.

The tea was drawn.<eos>: 65.90717456092766
He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby,
smiling.<eos>: 46.94132984845122
Silly Milly’s birthday gift.<eos>: 35.14803463981194
Only five she was then.<eos>: 62.7762302868671
No, wait:
four.<eos>: 38.546246896156205
I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke.<eos>: 40.18128678377249
Putting pieces of
folded brown paper in the letterbox for her.<eos>: 43.838217706752175
He smiled, pouring.

     O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.
     You are my lookingglass from night to morning.
     I’d rather have you without a farthing
     Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.

Poor old professor Goodwin.<eos>: 131.91641228597473
Dreadful old case.<eos>: 17.539746395432164
Still he was a courteous
old chap.<eos>: 26.466611428886452
Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform.<eos>: 54.55564585888076
And
the little mirror in his silk hat.<eos>: 33.17920811177142
The night Milly brought it into the
parlour.<eos>: 41.70331673623701
O, look what I found in professor Goodwin’s hat!<eos>: 50.36984012571432
All we
laughed.<eos>: 24.90758051356649
Sex breaking out even then.<eos>: 55.285005120464014
Pert little piece she was.

He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the
teapot on the tray.<eos>: 73.40450373351518
Its hump bumped as he took it up.<eos>: 27.029186070943535
Everything on it?
Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream.<eos>: 59.670419092425
Yes.<eos>: 2.0880743848448278
He carried it
upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.

Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it
on the chair by the bedhead.

—What a time you were!<eos>: 56.27230334383761
she said.

She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on
the pillow.<eos>: 60.5879815347859
He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large
soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat’s udder.<eos>: 52.75182372808759
The
warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance
of the tea she poured.

A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow.<eos>: 54.27761996941987
In the
act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.

—Who was the letter from?<eos>: 26.05089241322962
he asked.

Bold hand.<eos>: 29.942639817378602
Marion.

—O, Boylan, she said.<eos>: 14.237228994926781
He’s bringing the programme.

—What are you singing?

—_Là ci darem_ with J.<eos>: 26.595144407148652
C.<eos>: 3.246585668467089
Doyle, she said, and _Love’s Old Sweet Song_.

Her full lips, drinking, smiled.<eos>: 33.63070280357309
Rather stale smell that incense leaves
next day.<eos>: 228.31574838174146
Like foul flowerwater.

—Would you like the window open a little?

She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:

—What time is the funeral?

—Eleven, I think, he answered.<eos>: 49.77045492879857
I didn’t see the paper.

Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled
drawers from the bed.<eos>: 55.04089362249272
No?<eos>: 7.6288815975081885
Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a
stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.

—No: that book.

Other stocking.<eos>: 126.25108976787352
Her petticoat.

—It must have fell down, she said.

He felt here and there.<eos>: 41.61006280775036
_Voglio e non vorrei_.<eos>: 29.385182228513507
Wonder if she pronounces
that right: _voglio_.<eos>: 31.761467353925998
Not in the bed.<eos>: 9.024094470240705
Must have slid down.<eos>: 56.51473011442124
He stooped
and lifted the valance.<eos>: 17.37344494750671
The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of
the orangekeyed chamberpot.

—Show here, she said.<eos>: 24.308498074287314
I put a mark in it.<eos>: 17.84165758387213
There’s a word I wanted to
ask you.

She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and,
having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the
text with the hairpin till she reached the word.

—Met him what?<eos>: 47.41934169787107
he asked.

—Here, she said.<eos>: 8.938855299394955
What does that mean?

He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.

—Metempsychosis?

—Yes.<eos>: 40.00845621443501
Who’s he when he’s at home?

—Metempsychosis, he said, frowning.<eos>: 21.824090763486506
It’s Greek: from the Greek.<eos>: 26.101986141421143
That
means the transmigration of souls.

—O, rocks!<eos>: 28.264978411931853
she said.<eos>: 3.4612706779243974
Tell us in plain words.

He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes.<eos>: 41.329580804411
The same young eyes.
The first night after the charades.<eos>: 56.900396767310326
Dolphin’s Barn.<eos>: 4.85073477074727
He turned over the
smudged pages.<eos>: 14.85165394917294
_Ruby: the Pride of the Ring_.<eos>: 10.64059238487041
Hello.<eos>: 13.159053129147367

Mob gaping.
Break your neck and we’ll break our sides.<eos>: 77.79217975260784
Families of them.<eos>: 10.401535800011438
Bone them
young so they metamspychosis.<eos>: 47.98479738875682
That we live after death.<eos>: 54.97891220314272
Our souls.<eos>: 14.456094837060169
That
a man’s soul after he dies.<eos>: 26.9443401142011
Dignam’s soul...

—Did you finish it?<eos>: 19.031614670964842
he asked.

—Yes, she said.<eos>: 6.9691837765012385
There’s nothing smutty in it.<eos>: 22.538368334349194
Is she in love with the
first fellow all the time?

—Never read it.<eos>: 48.593544598546345
Do you want another?

—Yes.<eos>: 16.30610389972408
Get another of Paul de Kock’s.<eos>: 27.552808810725633
Nice name he has.

She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.

Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they’ll write to
Kearney, my guarantor.<eos>: 78.10759711784384
Reincarnation: that’s the word.

—Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body
after death, that we lived before.<eos>: 70.06743123968984
They call it reincarnation.<eos>: 9.134894296045433
That we
all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other
planet.<eos>: 93.36294140039342
They say we have forgotten it.<eos>: 25.6663841699773
Some say they remember their
past lives.

The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea.<eos>: 94.91192947530298
Better
remind her of the word: metempsychosis.<eos>: 38.95434531494714
An example would be better.<eos>: 32.92384490042706
An
example?

The _Bath of the Nymph_ over the bed.<eos>: 16.53454750227471
Given away with the Easter number
of _Photo Bits_: Splendid masterpiece in art colours.<eos>: 63.891862498362755
Tea before you
put milk in.<eos>: 55.05585233381068
Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer.<eos>: 39.00006429992035
Three and six
I gave for the frame.<eos>: 134.73944370887784
She said it would look nice over the bed.<eos>: 34.57699484070271
Naked
nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.

He turned the pages back.

—Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it.<eos>: 71.31792606184288
They
used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for
instance.<eos>: 48.500914899799916
What they called nymphs, for example.

Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar.<eos>: 72.53257817962506
She gazed straight before her,
inhaling through her arched nostrils.

—There’s a smell of burn, she said.<eos>: 21.147220615681807
Did you leave anything on the fire?

—The kidney!<eos>: 29.099346828597945
he cried suddenly.

He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes
against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping
hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork’s legs.<eos>: 52.5647309839376
Pungent smoke
shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan.<eos>: 62.23805711477141
By prodding a prong of
the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its
back.<eos>: 44.92524337481222
Only a little burnt.<eos>: 25.91236764480412
He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and
let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.

Cup of tea now.<eos>: 69.37716633934777
He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf.<eos>: 36.5543458328482
He
shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat.<eos>: 66.20475307742615
Then he put a
forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant
meat.<eos>: 28.114491468368023
Done to a turn.<eos>: 14.738162491901315
A mouthful of tea.<eos>: 8.123969989847215
Then he cut away dies of
bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth.<eos>: 33.15629828744795
What was that
about some young student and a picnic?<eos>: 55.805901936629745
He creased out the letter at his
side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in
the gravy and raising it to his mouth.


Dearest Papli

I hear them at the piano

There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday.
There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his
cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan’s (I was on the
pop of writing Blazes Boylan’s) song about those seaside girls.<eos>: 97.76660363631667

Jolly

He would be eleven now if he had lived.

His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript.<eos>: 38.8606735542698

He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece
after piece of kidney.<eos>: 97.77332869036714
Twelve and six a week.<eos>: 49.09535166821269
Not much.<eos>: 11.087852197841482

Young student.<eos>: 13.819867294665155
He drank a draught of
cooler tea to wash down his meal.<eos>: 60.65155148311862
Then he read the letter again: twice.

O, well: she knows how to mind herself.<eos>: 84.01231753455349
But if not?<eos>: 20.636840773541792
No, nothing has
happened.<eos>: 62.26656668295731
Of course it might.<eos>: 35.893745791796285
Wait in any case till it does.<eos>: 30.286984632088863
A wild
piece of goods.<eos>: 77.23585148016322
Her slim legs running up the staircase.<eos>: 38.8561487396682
Destiny.
Ripening now.<eos>: 4.128292427615706
Vain: very.

He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window.<eos>: 83.62243211328025
Day I caught
her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red.<eos>: 64.31221074978049
Anemic a
little.<eos>: 19.45480831284336
Was given milk too long.<eos>: 71.3722631416968
On the _Erin’s King_ that day round
the Kish.<eos>: 20.423251715292224
Damned old tub pitching about.<eos>: 18.431726890308397
Not a bit funky.<eos>: 10.410519548145828
Her pale blue
scarf loose in the wind with her hair.

     All dimpled cheeks and curls,
     Your head it simply swirls.

Seaside girls.<eos>: 112.02750418118782
Torn envelope.<eos>: 14.580839474089014
Hands stuck in his trousers’ pockets,
jarvey off for the day, singing.<eos>: 71.23332049013422
Friend of the family.<eos>: 9.140718480841
Swurls, he says.
Pier with lamps, summer evening, band.

     Those girls, those girls,
     Those lovely seaside girls.

Milly too.<eos>: 150.55246469108027
Young kisses: the first.<eos>: 44.1006070078906
Far away now past.<eos>: 98.64772767916074
Mrs Marion.
Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling,
braiding.

A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing.<eos>: 41.322039324079256
Will
happen, yes.<eos>: 10.094026058066957
Prevent.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Useless: can’t move.<eos>: 30.88858297693262
Girl’s sweet light lips.
Will happen too.<eos>: 59.357921328198444
He felt the flowing qualm spread over him.<eos>: 63.391141709561616
Useless to
move now.<eos>: 20.61369697417476
Lips kissed, kissing, kissed.<eos>: 79.74529193771228
Full gluey woman’s lips.

Better where she is down there: away.<eos>: 53.70936479139086
Occupy her.<eos>: 11.119019756903233
Wanted a dog to pass
the time.<eos>: 29.07468780035199
Might take a trip down there.<eos>: 16.209035011782127
August bank holiday, only two
and six return.<eos>: 79.93304496541474
Six weeks off, however.<eos>: 55.92299442098819
Might work a press pass.<eos>: 68.2834402439361
Or
through M’Coy.

The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper,
nosed at it and stalked to the door.<eos>: 35.005788310077826
She looked back at him, mewing.
Wants to go out.<eos>: 36.74681001825038
Wait before a door sometime it will open.<eos>: 92.26067164963288
Let her
wait.<eos>: 15.255610807311818
Has the fidgets.<eos>: 7.597008815369607
Electric.<eos>: 7.4757970951380495
Thunder in the air.<eos>: 6.478530796087707
Was washing at her
ear with her back to the fire too.

He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels.<eos>: 86.55082788270046
He stood
up, undoing the waistband of his trousers.<eos>: 24.807403643080935
The cat mewed to him.

—Miaow!<eos>: 15.408325569515302
he said in answer.<eos>: 17.304202081387018
Wait till I’m ready.

Heaviness: hot day coming.<eos>: 34.72846508195895
Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the
landing.

A paper.<eos>: 43.551321904705325
He liked to read at stool.<eos>: 45.83063624761221
Hope no ape comes knocking just as
I’m.

In the tabledrawer he found an old number of _Titbits_.<eos>: 56.853837693240905
He folded it
under his armpit, went to the door and opened it.<eos>: 35.4511948499148
The cat went up in
soft bounds.<eos>: 52.50218817358723
Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.

Listening, he heard her voice:

—Come, come, pussy.<eos>: 33.684615048242414
Come.

He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen
towards the next garden.<eos>: 46.71810337865985
No sound.<eos>: 10.344900888625054
Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.
The maid was in the garden.<eos>: 90.52713411373583
Fine morning.

He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.
Make a summerhouse here.<eos>: 79.24456774571136
Scarlet runners.<eos>: 3.1231663753025423
Virginia creepers.<eos>: 2.842387380473868
Want to
manure the whole place over, scabby soil.<eos>: 32.84995231666275
A coat of liver of sulphur.
All soil like that without dung.<eos>: 138.76956132890047
Household slops.<eos>: 21.438339783059856
Loam, what is this
that is?<eos>: 21.01306079632847
The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top
dressing.<eos>: 68.85401162446746
Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are
fed on those oilcakes.<eos>: 63.980731781885396
Mulch of dung.<eos>: 16.406140373861398
Best thing to clean ladies’ kid
gloves.<eos>: 106.15625163522162
Dirty cleans.<eos>: 3.204477029398111
Ashes too.<eos>: 5.701303431436737
Reclaim the whole place.<eos>: 14.86927304353006
Grow peas in
that corner there.<eos>: 25.10775761643455
Lettuce.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Always have fresh greens then.<eos>: 38.45851539225823
Still
gardens have their drawbacks.<eos>: 40.83536132716909
That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.

He walked on.<eos>: 47.18688542028785
Where is my hat, by the way?<eos>: 30.67259760713702
Must have put it back on the
peg.<eos>: 13.103210605208483
Or hanging up on the floor.<eos>: 12.650321408927697
Funny I don’t remember that.<eos>: 15.025704401933057
Hallstand
too full.<eos>: 23.85568679094953
Four umbrellas, her raincloak.<eos>: 10.592743660260213
Picking up the letters.
Drago’s shopbell ringing.<eos>: 23.660778854054183
Queer I was just thinking that moment.<eos>: 39.97568589046391
Brown
brillantined hair over his collar.<eos>: 31.188164535314115
Just had a wash and brushup.<eos>: 22.144580654745603
Wonder
have I time for a bath this morning.<eos>: 42.963440528103256
Tara street.<eos>: 7.10352329000401
Chap in the paybox
there got away James Stephens, they say.<eos>: 51.305499804976115
O’Brien.

Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has.<eos>: 74.74000328140679
Agendath what is it?<eos>: 9.231040481181907
Now, my miss.
Enthusiast.

He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes.<eos>: 42.556512086281295
Better be careful not to
get these trousers dirty for the funeral.<eos>: 97.24224293781242
He went in, bowing his head
under the low lintel.<eos>: 36.278246371715
Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy
limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces.<eos>: 16.573470615887697
Before sitting down he
peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows.<eos>: 37.437106071218416
The king was in his
countinghouse.<eos>: 11.52030749514594
Nobody.

Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over
on his bared knees.<eos>: 41.88935670872286
Something new and easy.<eos>: 49.12380644080914
No great hurry.<eos>: 28.601685580373434
Keep it a
bit.<eos>: 10.13008306357483
Our prize titbit: _Matcham’s Masterstroke_.<eos>: 9.872337011424012
Written by Mr Philip
Beaufoy, Playgoers’ Club, London.<eos>: 37.55730564168171
Payment at the rate of one guinea a
column has been made to the writer.<eos>: 41.99509674141578
Three and a half.<eos>: 37.292902397421564
Three pounds
three.<eos>: 83.43269193356777
Three pounds, thirteen and six.

Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding
but resisting, began the second.<eos>: 64.85392925687188
Midway, his last resistance yielding,
he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading
still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone.<eos>: 80.67315268880364
Hope
it’s not too big bring on piles again.<eos>: 39.27040825994955
No, just right.<eos>: 24.198577257169458
So.<eos>: 4.161583005142314
Ah!<eos>: 4.727096607653369
Costive.
One tabloid of cascara sagrada.<eos>: 10.524103658885682
Life might be so.<eos>: 18.755405368164922
It did not move or
touch him but it was something quick and neat.<eos>: 81.99372867831065
Print anything now.
Silly season.<eos>: 62.917043754716275
He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell.<eos>: 186.30918939139715
Neat
certainly.<eos>: 19.48802035113867
_Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won
the laughing witch who now_.<eos>: 86.14618784069206
Begins and ends morally.<eos>: 17.416029878883702
_Hand in hand_.
Smart.<eos>: 28.720974202183253
He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his
water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and
received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.

Might manage a sketch.<eos>: 105.02559478091527

Bloom.<eos>: 2.274976556565249
Invent a story for
some proverb.<eos>: 20.612404656430137
Which?<eos>: 5.284593584759596
Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what
she said dressing.<eos>: 36.64013882583334
Dislike dressing together.<eos>: 38.92952975386245
Nicked myself shaving.
Biting her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt.<eos>: 29.668330728797912
Timing her.
9.15.<eos>: 40.93453748433238
Did Roberts pay you yet?<eos>: 41.383421901139656
9.20.<eos>: 64.31335078523097
What had Gretta Conroy on?<eos>: 53.08567249774464
9.23.
What possessed me to buy this comb?<eos>: 106.66480272656776
9.24.<eos>: 13.136324808451086
I’m swelled after that
cabbage.<eos>: 17.50565977787502
A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.

Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf.<eos>: 93.29801088548543
Morning
after the bazaar dance when May’s band played Ponchielli’s dance of the
hours.<eos>: 110.68929928434011
Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then
night hours.<eos>: 218.41223180454617
Washing her teeth.<eos>: 9.722061255389292
That was the first night.<eos>: 17.286750968154145
Her head
dancing.<eos>: 47.28639084783684
Her fansticks clicking.<eos>: 4.602876888517636
Is that Boylan well off?<eos>: 83.9164757688911
He has money.
Why?<eos>: 42.4578343555934
I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing.<eos>: 71.00080089612197
No use
humming then.<eos>: 88.11189801734005
Allude to it.<eos>: 9.084054763310554
Strange kind of music that last night.<eos>: 45.680552098899796
The
mirror was in shadow.<eos>: 36.38112640922482
She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen
vest against her full wagging bub.<eos>: 49.070613852967966
Peering into it.<eos>: 13.255813698394547
Lines in her eyes.
It wouldn’t pan out somehow.

Evening hours, girls in grey gauze.<eos>: 79.71269776810695
Night hours then: black with
daggers and eyemasks.<eos>: 50.40373467054809
Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then
black.<eos>: 145.27815573763303
Still, true to life also.<eos>: 62.24508735025596
Day: then the night.

He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it.
Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself.<eos>: 73.79536223888228
He pulled
back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom
into the air.

In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully
his black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees.<eos>: 41.83200972053286
What
time is the funeral?<eos>: 23.09265770504708
Better find out in the paper.

A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up.<eos>: 29.11327984798867
The bells of George’s
church.<eos>: 15.662462145745014
They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.

     Heigho!<eos>: 92.35989616886756
Heigho!
     Heigho!<eos>: 19.703544247029313
Heigho!
     Heigho!<eos>: 19.703544247029313
Heigho!

Quarter to.<eos>: 63.01206919083706
There again: the overtone following through the air.<eos>: 26.63903185240155
A
third.

Poor Dignam!




[ 5 ]


By lorries along sir John Rogerson’s quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past
Windmill lane, Leask’s the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph
office.<eos>: 56.03012831234114
Could have given that address too.<eos>: 45.02220121043886
And past the sailors’ home.
He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through
Lime street.<eos>: 34.925828838082765
By Brady’s cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket
of offal linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt.<eos>: 39.83810675571368
A smaller girl with scars of
eczema on her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered
caskhoop.<eos>: 54.851487294566695
Tell him if he smokes he won’t grow.<eos>: 21.05232568066558
O let him!<eos>: 19.97975869949092
His life
isn’t such a bed of roses.<eos>: 47.89478918566671
Waiting outside pubs to bring da home.<eos>: 42.98679949048808
Come
home to ma, da.<eos>: 20.694384926194022
Slack hour: won’t be many there.<eos>: 35.01353873854637
He crossed Townsend
street, passed the frowning face of Bethel.<eos>: 32.946143747112096
El, yes: house of: Aleph,
Beth.<eos>: 22.80169350598055
And past Nichols’ the undertaker.<eos>: 22.858168150288037
At eleven it is.<eos>: 30.181644858934114
Time enough.
Daresay Corny Kelleher bagged the job for O’Neill’s.<eos>: 29.734485670111148
Singing with his
eyes shut.<eos>: 23.314946829347786
Corny.<eos>: 13.302561191443383
Met her once in the park.<eos>: 26.316086447215067
In the dark.<eos>: 6.277605637289946
What a lark.
Police tout.<eos>: 20.53875572695466
Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom
tooraloom tay.<eos>: 104.94332918032873
O, surely he bagged it.<eos>: 20.5279867692521
Bury him cheap in a
whatyoumaycall.<eos>: 16.022790080044626
With my tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.

In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental
Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend,
finest quality, family tea.<eos>: 69.33825638445423
Rather warm.<eos>: 22.40989124268943
Tea.<eos>: 3.9041473340537896
Must get some from Tom
Kernan.<eos>: 35.64797849291981
Couldn’t ask him at a funeral, though.<eos>: 17.893363535675025
While his eyes still
read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent
his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair.<eos>: 52.253846084895045
Very warm
morning.<eos>: 30.206508172508276
Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the
leather headband inside his high grade ha.<eos>: 76.42937467661939
Just there.<eos>: 9.52523029763081
His right hand
came down into the bowl of his hat.<eos>: 23.842006430736813
His fingers found quickly a card
behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.

So warm.<eos>: 67.86307404670266
His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and
hair.<eos>: 76.93599941768127
Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice
blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands.<eos>: 45.34107056968115
The far east.<eos>: 44.420589046747146
Lovely spot it
must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on,
cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them.<eos>: 47.63218314048494
Wonder is it like
that.<eos>: 11.199130371332359
Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in _dolce far niente_,
not doing a hand’s turn all day.<eos>: 62.18931363326597
Sleep six months out of twelve.<eos>: 61.32114639915618
Too
hot to quarrel.<eos>: 17.069756089840066
Influence of the climate.<eos>: 4.036358187565683
Lethargy.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Flowers of
idleness.<eos>: 4.819819378451285
The air feeds most.<eos>: 39.80577869662789
Azotes.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Hothouse in Botanic gardens.
Sensitive plants.<eos>: 41.63632422759778
Waterlilies.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Petals too tired to.<eos>: 50.161705192783025
Sleeping sickness
in the air.<eos>: 6.983683307984819
Walk on roseleaves.<eos>: 9.597457892071077
Imagine trying to eat tripe and
cowheel.<eos>: 16.02364496324074
Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere?<eos>: 52.39248485768229
Ah yes, in
the dead sea floating on his back, reading a book with a parasol open.
Couldn’t sink if you tried: so thick with salt.<eos>: 63.18434608509598

Post here.<eos>: 7.952950661070654
No-one.
In.

He handed the card through the brass grill.

—Are there any letters for me?<eos>: 49.778924943535934
he asked.

While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting
poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his
baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper.<eos>: 69.40351040940394
No answer

Went too far last time.

The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a
letter.<eos>: 52.41332009634362
He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.

He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right.<eos>: 22.85022234333581
Talk: as if
that would mend matters.<eos>: 36.73742029634768
His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger
felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.
Women will pay a lot of heed, I don’t think.<eos>: 45.33572423697905
His fingers drew forth the

Hate company when
you.

—Hello, Bloom.<eos>: 27.54555789493218
Where are you off to?

—Hello, M’Coy.<eos>: 22.27693976018123
Nowhere in particular.

—How’s the body?

—Fine.<eos>: 33.82453784085063
How are you?

—Just keeping alive, M’Coy said.

His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect:

—Is there any...<eos>: 72.77329666376086
no trouble I hope?<eos>: 34.34022297071802
I see you’re...

—O, no, Mr Bloom said.<eos>: 8.38818076898352
Poor Dignam, you know.<eos>: 14.763561808732698
The funeral is today.

—To be sure, poor fellow.<eos>: 37.879187367573365
So it is.<eos>: 7.779190276856782
What time?

A photo it isn’t.<eos>: 44.0535156216471
A badge maybe.

—E...eleven, Mr Bloom answered.

—I must try to get out there, M’Coy said.<eos>: 31.87269753119615
Eleven, is it?<eos>: 15.659587888418521
I only heard
it last night.<eos>: 38.04643608637021
Who was telling me?<eos>: 10.965305145232108
Holohan.<eos>: 2.949105432905997
You know Hoppy?

—I know.

Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door
of the Grosvenor.<eos>: 26.389238663430174
The porter hoisted the valise up on the well.<eos>: 108.56114905868046
She
stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her,
searched his pockets for change.<eos>: 78.42539947715652
Stylish kind of coat with that roll
collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth.<eos>: 167.61996230345554

Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath
his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the
braided drums.<eos>: 69.88715904836951
Clearly I can see today.<eos>: 28.225900155970017

Which side will
she get up?

—And he said: _Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy!<eos>: 84.57338491543086
What Paddy?_ I
said.<eos>: 38.31230127031744
_Poor little Paddy Dignam_, he said.

Off to the country: Broadstone probably.<eos>: 42.74117031728024

dangling.<eos>: 41.12618659198181

Eye out for other fellow always.<eos>: 69.70551117707798
Good fallback.<eos>: 2.981041566721684
Two
strings to her bow.

—_Why?_ I said.<eos>: 35.916007084298236
_What’s wrong with him?_ I said.

Proud: rich: silk stockings.

—Yes, Mr Bloom said.

He moved a little to the side of M’Coy’s talking head.<eos>: 59.21330834243669
Getting up in a
minute.

—_What’s wrong with him_?<eos>: 18.45377567862367
He said.<eos>: 3.492439908750907
_He’s dead_, he said.<eos>: 4.324028609103565
And, faith, he
filled up.<eos>: 23.966553786211243
_Is it Paddy Dignam_?<eos>: 48.81020711229773
I said.<eos>: 4.80826399628794
I couldn’t believe it when I
heard it.<eos>: 13.875966916839698
I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it
in the Arch.<eos>: 106.07687210612292
_Yes,_ he said.<eos>: 8.95201938299993
_He’s gone.<eos>: 8.833001965381044
He died on Monday, poor
fellow_.

A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.

Well, what are you gaping at?

—Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh.<eos>: 24.5167303023559
Another gone.

—One of the best, M’Coy said.

The tram passed.<eos>: 30.6351879639204
They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich
gloved hand on the steel grip.<eos>: 41.39540685325686
Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her
hat in the sun: flicker, flick.

—Wife well, I suppose?<eos>: 21.13614426604187
M’Coy’s changed voice said.

—O, yes, Mr Bloom said.<eos>: 10.861046327064237
Tiptop, thanks.

He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly:

     What is home without
     Plumtree’s Potted Meat?
     Incomplete.
     With it an abode of bliss.

—My missus has just got an engagement.<eos>: 53.304095209293365
At least it’s not settled yet.

Valise tack again.<eos>: 50.0057118505181
By the way no harm.<eos>: 18.229652693062643
I’m off that, thanks.

Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.

—My wife too, he said.<eos>: 17.715581676196887
She’s going to sing at a swagger affair in the
Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth.

—That so?<eos>: 28.032833905227342
M’Coy said.<eos>: 4.923448016411113
Glad to hear that, old man.<eos>: 21.10076299462051
Who’s getting it up?

Mrs Marion Bloom.<eos>: 24.80316968242853
Not up yet.<eos>: 36.682712793153385
Queen was in her bedroom eating bread
and.<eos>: 81.04858657082414

Torn strip of

     Love’s
     Old
     Sweet
     Song
     Comes lo-ove’s old...

—It’s a kind of a tour, don’t you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.
_Sweeeet song_.<eos>: 33.56915711756708
There’s a committee formed.<eos>: 25.26391118219033
Part shares and part
profits.

M’Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.

—O, well, he said.<eos>: 25.435939655659645
That’s good news.

He moved to go.

—Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said.<eos>: 30.451976269407353
Meet you knocking around.

—Yes, Mr Bloom said.

—Tell you what, M’Coy said.<eos>: 16.601907719619135
You might put down my name at the funeral,
will you?<eos>: 33.93786944414443
I’d like to go but I mightn’t be able, you see.<eos>: 19.809612999649808
There’s a
drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself
would have to go down if the body is found.<eos>: 73.00901931038952
You just shove in my name
if I’m not there, will you?

—I’ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off.<eos>: 23.692336794907753
That’ll be all right.

—Right, M’Coy said brightly.<eos>: 14.821659286796292
Thanks, old man.<eos>: 10.473174615098293
I’d go if I possibly
could.<eos>: 25.05545112149689
Well, tolloll.<eos>: 5.85853912353348
Just C.<eos>: 13.809257630428807
P.<eos>: 1.5609974020387252
M’Coy will do.

—That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.

Didn’t catch me napping that wheeze.<eos>: 20.598786654181463
The quick touch.<eos>: 34.36935935563445
Soft mark.<eos>: 13.049977926088697
I’d
like my job.<eos>: 11.90977336830021
Valise I have a particular fancy for.<eos>: 44.325901047691545
Leather.<eos>: 3.475665430980611
Capped

Bob Cowley lent him
his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings
of it from that good day to this.

Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled.<eos>: 113.50689734693225
My missus has
just got an.<eos>: 60.220617191001566
Reedy freckled soprano.<eos>: 3.3831009326705948
Cheeseparing nose.<eos>: 11.77864714406889
Nice enough in
its way: for a little ballad.<eos>: 72.08703665165568
No guts in it.<eos>: 17.54476457788418
You and me, don’t you
know: in the same boat.<eos>: 24.783883655631723
Softsoaping.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Give you the needle that would.
Can’t he hear the difference?<eos>: 34.774423393584584
Think he’s that way inclined a bit.
Against my grain somehow.<eos>: 56.09347194425786
Thought that Belfast would fetch him.<eos>: 24.518598593229786
I hope
that smallpox up there doesn’t get worse.<eos>: 30.95457683017674
Suppose she wouldn’t let
herself be vaccinated again.<eos>: 22.389169353047613
Your wife and my wife.

Wonder is he pimping after me?

Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured
hoardings.<eos>: 35.61126398112854
Cantrell and Cochrane’s Ginger Ale (Aromatic).<eos>: 21.757718812330513
Clery’s
Summer Sale.<eos>: 18.2103132849865
No, he’s going on straight.<eos>: 18.143645492358
Hello.<eos>: 13.159053129147367
_Leah_ tonight.<eos>: 7.310468368152326
Mrs
Bandmann Palmer.<eos>: 10.611076647241104
Like to see her again in that.<eos>: 32.694303013787255
_Hamlet_ she played
last night.<eos>: 42.952923959807954
Male impersonator.<eos>: 3.8051124853941016
Perhaps he was a woman.<eos>: 8.890377938955886
Why Ophelia
committed suicide.<eos>: 51.327542275035924
Poor papa!<eos>: 16.73441324132984
How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in
that.<eos>: 37.283360267409435
Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in.
Year before I was born that was: sixtyfive.<eos>: 82.23960299787359
And Ristori in Vienna.<eos>: 12.111179388863603
What
is this the right name is?<eos>: 35.69018516512991
By Mosenthal it is.<eos>: 9.976984881667658
Rachel, is it?<eos>: 13.40020862773526
No.<eos>: 5.3673087592043816
The
scene he was always talking about where the old blind Abraham
recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face.

Nathan’s voice!<eos>: 54.01400026825219
His son’s voice!<eos>: 11.304377499553357
I hear the voice of Nathan who left
his father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of
his father and left the God of his father.

Every word is so deep, Leopold.

Poor papa!<eos>: 84.05060927407816
Poor man!<eos>: 9.793212897399817
I’m glad I didn’t go into the room to look at his
face.<eos>: 17.98191582615895
That day!<eos>: 17.98861461821691
O, dear!<eos>: 11.146300348071552
O, dear!<eos>: 11.146300348071552
Ffoo!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
Well, perhaps it was best for
him.

Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the
hazard.<eos>: 26.90882295258035
No use thinking of it any more.<eos>: 42.1059305371343
Nosebag time.<eos>: 10.049098789924916
Wish I hadn’t met
that M’Coy fellow.

He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently
champing teeth.<eos>: 55.57834912354086
Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid
the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss.<eos>: 59.074165247545665
Their Eldorado.<eos>: 3.2905992543595457
Poor jugginses!<eos>: 4.27562415461692
Damn
all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in
nosebags.<eos>: 65.04479615801891
Too full for words.<eos>: 28.43254212439369
Still they get their feed all right and
their doss.<eos>: 56.15389686895998
Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp
between their haunches.<eos>: 53.09616526209104
Might be happy all the same that way.<eos>: 34.08335094244573
Good poor
brutes they look.<eos>: 61.02486444406536
Still their neigh can be very irritating.

He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he
carried.<eos>: 40.07155507234565
Might just walk into her here.<eos>: 41.23954164931333
The lane is safer.

He passed the cabman’s shelter.<eos>: 18.263627269160583
Curious the life of drifting cabbies.
All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own.
_Voglio e non_.<eos>: 39.00357089776394
Like to give them an odd cigarette.<eos>: 44.09883328028578
Sociable.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Shout a
few flying syllables as they pass.<eos>: 52.20864372402565
He hummed:

     Là ci darem la mano
     La la lala la la.


He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in

A flower.<eos>: 50.27319361307766

A yellow flower with flattened petals.<eos>: 17.1386706700922
Not
annoyed then?<eos>: 20.645758113345916
What does she say?


Dear Henry

I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it.<eos>: 83.20404066803304
I am sorry
you did not like my last letter.<eos>: 39.719539325298804
Why did you enclose the stamps?<eos>: 15.635975221665296
I am
awfully angry with you.<eos>: 55.05665632788877
I do wish I could punish you for that.<eos>: 31.171419469372196
I called
you naughty boy because I do not like that other world.<eos>: 37.69721382958649
Please tell me
what is the real meaning of that word?<eos>: 43.79761903774034
Are you not happy in your home
you poor little naughty boy?<eos>: 72.11393178283463
I do wish I could do something for you.
Please tell me what you think of poor me.<eos>: 51.962050707701515
I often think of the
beautiful name you have.<eos>: 48.6882320161471
Dear Henry, when will we meet?<eos>: 58.722278124905586
I think of you
so often you have no idea.<eos>: 51.78150955531102
I have never felt myself so much drawn to a
man as you.<eos>: 69.80533478994431
I feel so bad about.<eos>: 28.082366794014398
Please write me a long letter and tell
me more.<eos>: 32.96746571653997
Remember if you do not I will punish you.<eos>: 24.70786866568518
So now you know what
I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote.<eos>: 35.38682551695181
O how I long to
meet you.<eos>: 40.70274102705755
Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are
exhausted.<eos>: 102.32016978371894
Then I will tell you all.<eos>: 20.009170569856032
Goodbye now, naughty darling, I
have such a bad headache.<eos>: 31.603224658464136
today.<eos>: 1.9623753105978345
and write _by return_ to your longing

Martha


P.<eos>: 89.49842199061275
S.<eos>: 4.405906724215668
Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use.<eos>: 72.82343506446315
I want to
know.


He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell
and placed it in his heart pocket.<eos>: 82.89024468125807
Language of flowers.<eos>: 14.62181471517342
They like it
because no-one can hear.<eos>: 58.11353305853828
Or a poison bouquet to strike him down.<eos>: 33.062490575019915
Then
walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and
there a word.<eos>: 85.95504617029091
Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your
cactus if you don’t please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear
roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha’s
perfume.<eos>: 144.36367962969192
Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it
back in his sidepocket.

Weak joy opened his lips.<eos>: 44.43502184657688
Changed since the first letter.<eos>: 39.84399920727525
Wonder did
she wrote it herself.<eos>: 37.18331149727016
Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like
me, respectable character.<eos>: 76.8537696620987
Could meet one Sunday after the rosary.
Thank you: not having any.<eos>: 115.55720562465609
Usual love scrimmage.<eos>: 7.938121304531717
Then running round
corners.<eos>: 43.806214854837876
Bad as a row with Molly.<eos>: 74.14574751889614
Cigar has a cooling effect.<eos>: 17.85695291482068
Narcotic.
Go further next time.<eos>: 71.45304104666712
Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course.
Brutal, why not?<eos>: 76.33493861151857
Try it anyhow.<eos>: 12.82770059017782
A bit at a time.

Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.
Common pin, eh?<eos>: 48.87589749275392
He threw it on the road.<eos>: 19.183073629048778
Out of her clothes somewhere:
pinned together.<eos>: 82.89385311309702
Queer the number of pins they always have.<eos>: 59.39453637370988
No roses
without thorns.

Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head.<eos>: 81.49534512741005
Those two sluts that night in
the Coombe, linked together in the rain.

     O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers.
     She didn’t know what to do
     To keep it up,
     To keep it up.

It?<eos>: 50.60438349444673
Them.<eos>: 2.442843882694164
Such a bad headache.<eos>: 18.560721639813476
Has her roses probably.<eos>: 50.74095294106142
Or sitting all
day typing.<eos>: 43.18388993375241
Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves.<eos>: 137.15895854018171
What perfume does your
wife use.<eos>: 66.79616922225469
Now could you make out a thing like that?

     To keep it up.

Martha, Mary.<eos>: 45.65477592304539
I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or
faked for money.<eos>: 92.10288282483747
He is sitting in their house, talking.<eos>: 34.03662783172107
Mysterious.
Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.

     To keep it up.

Nice kind of evening feeling.<eos>: 84.86260038593113
No more wandering about.<eos>: 66.19713639431527
Just loll there:
quiet dusk: let everything rip.<eos>: 72.94324210428216
Forget.<eos>: 2.879962649995787
Tell about places you have
been, strange customs.<eos>: 63.54935204470007
The other one, jar on her head, was getting the
supper: fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like
the hole in the wall at Ashtown.<eos>: 105.4867570585723
Must carry a paper goblet next time I
go to the trottingmatches.<eos>: 30.918959665128927
She listens with big dark soft eyes.<eos>: 54.18499851851052
Tell
her: more and more: all.<eos>: 46.33117663353205
Then a sigh: silence.<eos>: 51.32372550123743
Long long long rest.

Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly
in shreds and scattered them towards the road.<eos>: 83.63988053629926
The shreds fluttered
away, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.

Henry Flower.<eos>: 78.70995784182156
You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the
same way.<eos>: 44.12835517257786
Simple bit of paper.<eos>: 15.354711799906482

cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland.<eos>: 35.490857451572424

A
million pounds, wait a moment.<eos>: 62.86419720737024
Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart,
eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of
porter.<eos>: 52.26057266430394
One and four into twenty: fifteen about.<eos>: 169.76781271703032
Yes, exactly.<eos>: 16.6535150352438
Fifteen
millions of barrels of porter.

What am I saying barrels?<eos>: 130.7602781142423
Gallons.<eos>: 3.3198239464232615
About a million barrels all the
same.

An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.
Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside.<eos>: 106.09613661503849
The
bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing
together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy
pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.

He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows.<eos>: 79.32594153408805
Stepping into the
porch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it
again behind the leather headband.<eos>: 41.548671179508524
Damn it.<eos>: 5.115295807017275
I might have tried to work
M’Coy for a pass to Mullingar.

Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking.
Sorry I didn’t work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of
that Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn’t.<eos>: 69.70029836805392
They’re taught that.
He’s not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to
baptise blacks, is he?<eos>: 33.2907037956745
The glasses would take their fancy, flashing.
Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced,
listening.<eos>: 99.40227082149426
Still life.<eos>: 10.90339432528307
Lap it up like milk, I suppose.

The cold smell of sacred stone called him.<eos>: 104.61130135311288
He trod the worn steps,
pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.

Something going on: some sodality.<eos>: 64.12121930697909

A batch
knelt at the altarrails.<eos>: 25.384692294565657
The priest went along by them, murmuring,
holding the thing in his hands.<eos>: 43.99073657217473
He stopped at each, took out a
communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it
neatly into her mouth.<eos>: 116.57122777255108
Her hat and head sank.<eos>: 81.18523699532938
Then the next one.<eos>: 31.4426501959189
Her
hat sank at once.<eos>: 60.3374745353621
Then the next one: a small old woman.<eos>: 61.89277738734592
The priest bent
down to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time.<eos>: 51.07736944917854

Why the cannibals cotton to it.

He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by
one, and seek their places.<eos>: 65.49607361039304
He approached a bench and seated himself in
its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper.<eos>: 37.90828054648686
These pots we have to wear.
We ought to have hats modelled on our heads.<eos>: 90.7262399696055
They were about him here
and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for
it to melt in their stomachs.<eos>: 57.106300811353634
Something like those mazzoth: it’s that
sort of bread: unleavened shewbread.<eos>: 18.7672054326696
Look at them.<eos>: 14.328119523161796
Now I bet it makes
them feel happy.<eos>: 68.33837537294923
Lollipop.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
It does.<eos>: 9.721592583256157
Yes, bread of angels it’s called.
There’s a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you
feel.<eos>: 63.73663217143507
First communicants.<eos>: 5.262898095549024
Hokypoky penny a lump.<eos>: 49.61908969671619
Then feel all like one
family party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim.<eos>: 107.30441693654743
They do.<eos>: 8.772083541558336
I’m
sure of that.<eos>: 12.23666157718462
Not so lonely.<eos>: 23.517916324624032
In our confraternity.<eos>: 7.558813499761961
Then come out a bit
spreeish.<eos>: 24.380526362372738
Let off steam.<eos>: 64.28553570363374
Thing is if you really believe in it.<eos>: 36.13972801713108

Lulls all pain.<eos>: 21.7567656638787
Wake this time

He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an
instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace
affair he had on.<eos>: 91.25474046967189
Suppose he lost the pin of his.<eos>: 25.141320710300263
He wouldn’t know what
to do to.<eos>: 14.581688437572703
Bald spot behind.<eos>: 40.19848650163333
Letters on his back: I.N.R.I?<eos>: 59.57311132998965
No: I.H.S.
Molly told me one time I asked her.<eos>: 63.704489938499265
I have sinned: or no: I have
suffered, it is.<eos>: 50.29093651668995
And the other one?<eos>: 34.1457802304126
Iron nails ran in.

Meet one Sunday after the rosary.<eos>: 133.74284907539155
Do not deny my request.<eos>: 39.23641442949143
Turn up with
a veil and black bag.<eos>: 36.67526034520332
Dusk and the light behind her.<eos>: 27.078774492079518
She might be here

Peter Carey, yes.<eos>: 16.572671986621156
No, Peter Claver I
am thinking of.<eos>: 31.831769602164414
Denis Carey.<eos>: 23.084066842951646
And just imagine that.<eos>: 38.45359270698908
Wife and six
children at home.<eos>: 44.02405356430481
And plotting that murder all the time.<eos>: 25.7108712915515
Those
crawthumpers, now that’s a good name for them, there’s always something
shiftylooking about them.<eos>: 24.01847699344251
They’re not straight men of business either.
O, no, she’s not here: the flower: no, no.<eos>: 38.20694416469163
By the way, did I tear up
that envelope?<eos>: 49.11845628732577
Yes: under the bridge.

The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs
smartly.<eos>: 43.73920989863815
Wine.<eos>: 2.2979173117585128
Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank
what they are used to Guinness’s porter or some temperance beverage
Wheatley’s Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane’s ginger ale
(aromatic).<eos>: 63.59937317897699
Doesn’t give them any of it: shew wine: only the other.
Cold comfort.<eos>: 56.55669749133105
Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they’d have one
old booser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink.<eos>: 65.13632159293479
Queer
the whole atmosphere of the.<eos>: 37.456411091619245
Quite right.<eos>: 6.63811189864246
Perfectly right that is.

Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir.<eos>: 37.51473434217999
Not going to be any music.
Pity.<eos>: 46.09970016993282
Who has the organ here I wonder?<eos>: 58.26324799474123
Old Glynn he knew how to make
that instrument talk, the _vibrato_: fifty pounds a year they say he
had in Gardiner street.<eos>: 54.79485904411803
Molly was in fine voice that day, the _Stabat
Mater_ of Rossini.<eos>: 24.402915802807758
Father Bernard Vaughan’s sermon first.<eos>: 17.124875104072036
Christ or
Pilate?<eos>: 11.114530299504437
Christ, but don’t keep us all night over it.<eos>: 40.57813367905634
Music they wanted.
Footdrill stopped.<eos>: 19.012447570819663
Could hear a pin drop.<eos>: 60.15577525606617
I told her to pitch her voice
against that corner.<eos>: 41.968661207375995
I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the
people looking up:

_Quis est homo._

Some of that old sacred music splendid.<eos>: 72.56247061995222
Mercadante: seven last words.
Mozart’s twelfth mass: _Gloria_ in that.<eos>: 38.00349138906199
Those old popes keen on music,
on art and statues and pictures of all kinds.<eos>: 251.2768717071863
Palestrina for example
too.<eos>: 22.994539329247512

—Yes, Mr Bloom said.

dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs.<eos>: 33.898244737292906
Lot of time taken up telling
your aches and pains.

—Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then
orangeflower water...

It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.

I’ll call later in the day and

How much are they?

—Fourpence, sir.

Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils.<eos>: 30.11214350990545
Sweet lemony wax.

—I’ll take this one, he said.<eos>: 13.132972686026946
That makes three and a penny.

—Yes, sir, the chemist said.<eos>: 19.074440085376953
You can pay all together, sir, when you
come back.

—Good, Mr Bloom said.

He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the
coolwrappered soap in his left hand.

At his armpit Bantam Lyons’ voice and hand said:

—Hello, Bloom.<eos>: 35.78736949615812
What’s the best news?<eos>: 11.799679671214156
Is that today’s?<eos>: 19.584363070800404

Bantam Lyons’s yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton.<eos>: 48.66527731980176

Maximum the
second.

—I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.

Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.

—What’s that?<eos>: 15.97464443174863
his sharp voice said.

—I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered.<eos>: 20.068785894440914
I was going to throw it away
that moment.

Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread
sheets back on Mr Bloom’s arms.

—I’ll risk it, he said.<eos>: 26.234956196527598
Here, thanks.

He sped off towards Conway’s corner.<eos>: 16.462474707513557
God speed scut.

Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap
in it, smiling.<eos>: 53.64007874457334

This is my body.

He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of
warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved.<eos>: 72.941758596809
He saw his trunk
and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward,
lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of
his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father
of thousands, a languid floating flower.

All waited.<eos>: 63.085085817082266
Nothing was said.<eos>: 24.193924114301666
Stowing in the wreaths probably.<eos>: 26.2926301143747
I am
sitting on something hard.<eos>: 55.44997006786413
Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket.<eos>: 52.146713607492586
Better
shift it out of that.<eos>: 25.102227017601678
Wait for an opportunity.

All waited.<eos>: 67.05919461607752
Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer:
then horses’ hoofs.<eos>: 162.01267820107296
A jolt.<eos>: 3.4811936918257143
Their carriage began to move, creaking and
swaying.<eos>: 57.02688071036417
Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind.<eos>: 158.35129405903862
The blinds of
the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar.
At walking pace.

They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were
passing along the tramtracks.<eos>: 117.99467143037805
Tritonville road.<eos>: 11.139290380263315
Quicker.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
The wheels
rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook
rattling in the doorframes.

—What way is he taking us?<eos>: 85.59675198283558
Mr Power asked through both windows.

—Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said.<eos>: 27.78889883033652
Ringsend.<eos>: 2.519151707553077
Brunswick street.

Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.

—That’s a fine old custom, he said.<eos>: 20.12368542972176
I am glad to see it has not died
out.

All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by
passers.<eos>: 105.13714655239794
Respect.<eos>: 1.924861428100816
The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the
smoother road past Watery lane.<eos>: 50.20513052174508
Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man,
clad in mourning, a wide hat.

—There’s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.

—Who is that?

—Your son and heir.

—Where is he?<eos>: 37.92112734078555
Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.

The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway
before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back
to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels.<eos>: 31.66922425873106
Mr Dedalus
fell back, saying:

—Was that Mulligan cad with him?<eos>: 42.82621102198795
His _fidus Achates_!

—No, Mr Bloom said.<eos>: 6.971960613033309
He was alone.

—Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding
faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa’s little lump
of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.

Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road.<eos>: 46.079952929143154
Wallace Bros: the
bottleworks: Dodder bridge.

Richie Goulding and the legal bag.<eos>: 38.64344679118964
Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls
the firm.<eos>: 38.56812325112727
His jokes are getting a bit damp.<eos>: 65.11669353832909
Great card he was.<eos>: 25.51936916814169
Waltzing
in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the
landlady’s two hats pinned on his head.<eos>: 50.341783663179555
Out on the rampage all night.
Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear.<eos>: 51.32249608674155

All breadcrumbs they
are.<eos>: 12.600446568828373
About six hundred per cent profit.

—He’s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled.<eos>: 33.14360003199478
That Mulligan is a
contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts.<eos>: 28.267721794103842
His name stinks
all over Dublin.<eos>: 43.69562945135437
But with the help of God and His blessed mother I’ll
make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother
or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a
gate.<eos>: 92.3335053907016
I’ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.

He cried above the clatter of the wheels:

—I won’t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son.<eos>: 38.76210367053195
A counterjumper’s
son.<eos>: 4.343975837131303

Not likely.

He ceased.<eos>: 28.404341914657422
Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power’s mild
face and Martin Cunningham’s eyes and beard, gravely shaking.<eos>: 52.62102914211073
Noisy
selfwilled man.<eos>: 7.469613645402749
Full of his son.<eos>: 15.083172737241915
He is right.<eos>: 10.590792272612243
Something to hand on.<eos>: 31.599868982050058
If
little Rudy had lived.<eos>: 61.1340080653396
See him grow up.<eos>: 28.867742089427185

Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit.<eos>: 53.75252519193242
My son.<eos>: 8.548951952213656
Me in his eyes.<eos>: 9.580883748614959
Strange
feeling it would be.<eos>: 26.57896464965747
From me.<eos>: 4.794848611677374
Just a chance.<eos>: 15.496123638125663
Must have been that
morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs
at it by the wall of the cease to do evil.<eos>: 65.4373450405318
And the sergeant grinning
up.<eos>: 25.650721138706242
She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched.<eos>: 143.0786245624651
Give us
a touch, Poldy.<eos>: 28.919456078308244
God, I’m dying for it.<eos>: 13.185308057161947
How life begins.

Got big then.<eos>: 139.42734721388223
Had to refuse the Greystones concert.<eos>: 37.487555072958074
My son inside her.
I could have helped him on in life.<eos>: 60.306993586520235
I could.<eos>: 8.93930957391129
Make him independent.
Learn German too.

—Are we late?<eos>: 108.26906384362537
Mr Power asked.

—Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.

Molly.<eos>: 24.349539009920655
Milly.<eos>: 4.251632289182689
Same thing watered down.<eos>: 29.92166905078236
Her tomboy oaths.<eos>: 23.54557337477056
O jumping
Jupiter!<eos>: 20.319376453848363
Ye gods and little fishes!<eos>: 111.75274970672935
Still, she’s a dear girl.<eos>: 17.437567211975313
Soon be a
woman.<eos>: 13.334280366308425
Mullingar.<eos>: 6.786078824955127
Dearest Papli.<eos>: 13.747523094185825
Young student.<eos>: 13.819867294665155
Yes, yes: a woman too.
Life, life.

The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.

—Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.

—He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn’t that squint troubling him.<eos>: 41.55992891177115
Do
you follow me?

He closed his left eye.<eos>: 20.610794235988884
Martin Cunningham began to brush away
crustcrumbs from under his thighs.

—What is this, he said, in the name of God?<eos>: 25.329000408427515
Crumbs?

—Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power
said.

All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless
leather of the seats.<eos>: 54.66036216978678
Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward
and said:

—Unless I’m greatly mistaken.<eos>: 31.705650738413485
What do you think, Martin?

—It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.

Mr Bloom set his thigh down.<eos>: 25.197430364447104
Glad I took that bath.<eos>: 25.887903181684873
Feel my feet quite
clean.<eos>: 59.27706053139476
But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.

Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.

—After all, he said, it’s the most natural thing in the world.

—Did Tom Kernan turn up?<eos>: 43.65677166438549
Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of
his beard gently.

—Yes, Mr Bloom answered.<eos>: 14.531923870482958
He’s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.

—And Corny Kelleher himself?<eos>: 50.76084906733968
Mr Power asked.

—At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.

—I met M’Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said.<eos>: 16.101466776841352
He said he’d try to come.

The carriage halted short.

—What’s wrong?

—We’re stopped.

—Where are we?

Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.

—The grand canal, he said.

Gasworks.<eos>: 21.549097367254085

Be good to Athos,
Leopold, is my last wish.<eos>: 83.2218768567715
Thy will be done.<eos>: 16.44234534509481
We obey them in the grave.
A dying scrawl.<eos>: 21.70924325097613
He took it to heart, pined away.<eos>: 27.700891868667675
Quiet brute.<eos>: 15.193293350849808
Old men’s
dogs usually are.

A raindrop spat on his hat.<eos>: 40.45529903723766
He drew back and saw an instant of shower
spray dots over the grey flags.<eos>: 30.99910676940331
Apart.<eos>: 1.7151985503931182
Curious.<eos>: 5.615201853495248
Like through a
colander.<eos>: 11.265299727299725
I thought it would.<eos>: 13.940159545726909
My boots were creaking I remember now.

—The weather is changing, he said quietly.

—A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.

—Wanted for the country, Mr Power said.<eos>: 40.64354586938753
There’s the sun again coming
out.

Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled
a mute curse at the sky.

—It’s as uncertain as a child’s bottom, he said.

—We’re off again.

The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed
gently.<eos>: 43.70951257320324
Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.

—Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said.<eos>: 36.67556912599631
And Paddy Leonard taking
him off to his face.

—O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly.<eos>: 30.970639013392283
Wait till you hear
him, Simon, on Ben Dollard’s singing of _The Croppy Boy_.

—Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously.<eos>: 30.064319529769683
_His singing of that simple
ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the
whole course of my experience._

—Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing.<eos>: 59.530676330098665
He’s dead nuts on that.<eos>: 22.992573085943558
And the
retrospective arrangement.

—Did you read Dan Dawson’s speech?<eos>: 31.993277607015546
Martin Cunningham asked.

—I did not then, Mr Dedalus said.<eos>: 10.657321084450777
Where is it?

—In the paper this morning.

Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket.<eos>: 27.54504236099378
That book I must change
for her.

—No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly.<eos>: 26.72801167172563
Later on please.

Mr Bloom’s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the
deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what
Peake is that?<eos>: 21.944802671073436
is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne’s?<eos>: 20.866475294275855
no, Sexton,
Urbright.<eos>: 6.492397201673045
Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.
Thanks to the Little Flower.<eos>: 107.03057616770377
Sadly missed.<eos>: 28.054334895956273

On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.

     It is now a month since dear Henry fled
     To his home up above in the sky
     While his family weeps and mourns his loss
     Hoping some day to meet him on high.

I tore up the envelope?<eos>: 143.4689055981145
Yes.<eos>: 2.0880743848448278
Where did I put her letter after I read it
in the bath?<eos>: 43.462114301239616
He patted his waistcoatpocket.<eos>: 5.479214703967005
There all right.<eos>: 16.841673051986906
Dear Henry
fled.<eos>: 10.092209236061933
Before my patience are exhausted.

An hour ago I was passing there.<eos>: 57.02206975718727
The jarvies raised their
hats.

A pointsman’s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a
tramway standard by Mr Bloom’s window.<eos>: 43.83966419457795
Couldn’t they invent something
automatic so that the wheel itself much handier?<eos>: 82.36392476886871
Well but that fellow
would lose his job then?<eos>: 72.49964367391128
Well but then another fellow would get a job
making the new invention?

Antient concert rooms.<eos>: 77.18310334433633

Who was he?

—How do you do?<eos>: 10.523001975181048
Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in
salute.

—He doesn’t see us, Mr Power said.<eos>: 15.499890106747038
Yes, he does.<eos>: 9.52664769125555
How do you do?

—Who?<eos>: 11.890059437297408
Mr Dedalus asked.

—Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said.<eos>: 10.01013604207815
There he is airing his quiff.

Just that moment I was thinking.

Mr Dedalus bent across to salute.<eos>: 36.182107614796415
From the door of the Red Bank the
white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.

Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right
hand.<eos>: 50.8638086578297
The nails, yes.<eos>: 20.40926705635428
Is there anything more in him that they she sees?
Fascination.<eos>: 106.13827681688917
Worst man in Dublin.<eos>: 21.467789997619743

They sometimes
feel what a person is.<eos>: 65.90077449085463
Instinct.<eos>: 2.326828506279764
But a type like that.<eos>: 32.81215698263016
My nails.<eos>: 22.26057767974772
I am
just looking at them: well pared.<eos>: 35.669172761522496
And after: thinking alone.<eos>: 125.12867021886197
Body
getting a bit softy.<eos>: 17.818808221894457
I would notice that: from remembering.<eos>: 125.58734023808164
What causes
that?<eos>: 31.971476037756194
I suppose the skin can’t contract quickly enough when the flesh
falls off.<eos>: 113.85157130820612
But the shape is there.<eos>: 25.90545745501641
The shape is there still.<eos>: 48.31656734534962
Shoulders.

Shift stuck between the
cheeks behind.

He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant
glance over their faces.

Mr Power asked:

—How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?

—O, very well, Mr Bloom said.<eos>: 51.511237097868
I hear great accounts of it.<eos>: 26.15190185337374
It’s a good
idea, you see...

—Are you going yourself?

—Well no, Mr Bloom said.<eos>: 20.972263099110926
In point of fact I have to go down to the
county Clare on some private business.<eos>: 44.88309799888848
You see the idea is to tour the
chief towns.<eos>: 37.557469288697085
What you lose on one you can make up on the other.

—Quite so, Martin Cunningham said.<eos>: 32.11946707262275
Mary Anderson is up there now.

Have you good artists?

—Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said.<eos>: 35.580302540476296
O yes, we’ll have all

—And _Madame_, Mr Power said smiling.<eos>: 16.206510459316718
Last but not least.

Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and
clasped them.<eos>: 40.74595944338716

The carriage
wheeling by Farrell’s statue united noiselessly their unresisting
knees.

Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his
mouth opening: oot.

—Four bootlaces for a penny.

Wonder why he was struck off the rolls.<eos>: 58.28367387384357
Had his office in Hume street.
Same house as Molly’s namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.

Terrible comedown, poor wretch!<eos>: 56.83277380844975
Kicked about like snuff at a wake.
O’Callaghan on his last legs.

And _Madame_.<eos>: 54.069916436087844

There is a word throstle that expresses that.

His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power’s goodlooking face.<eos>: 32.677567766519545
Greyish over
the ears.<eos>: 15.988579181624685
_Madame_: smiling.<eos>: 28.582216650789178
I smiled back.<eos>: 30.793971936210255
A smile goes a long way.
Only politeness perhaps.<eos>: 60.60628305469129
Nice fellow.<eos>: 9.367506918071344

Not pleasant for the wife.<eos>: 29.87552806557259

Or the
Moira, was it?

They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator’s form.

Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.

—Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.

A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner
of Elvery’s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his
spine.

—In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.

Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:

—The devil break the hasp of your back!

Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as
the carriage passed Gray’s statue.

—We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.

His eyes met Mr Bloom’s eyes.<eos>: 35.81113543688668
He caressed his beard, adding:

—Well, nearly all of us.

Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions’ faces.

—That’s an awfully good one that’s going the rounds about Reuben J and
the son.

—About the boatman?<eos>: 47.72236463515964
Mr Power asked.

—Yes.<eos>: 9.820591127177288
Isn’t it awfully good?

—What is that?<eos>: 13.45780942383244
Mr Dedalus asked.<eos>: 6.801287748240245
I didn’t hear it.

—There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to
send him to the Isle of Man out of harm’s way but when they were
both.....

—What?<eos>: 34.756733879794695
Mr Dedalus asked.<eos>: 6.801287748240245
That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?

—Yes, Mr Bloom said.<eos>: 14.394828419867942
They were both on the way to the boat and he tried
to drown.....

—Drown Barabbas!<eos>: 48.55090100785845
Mr Dedalus cried.<eos>: 7.450262620447289
I wish to Christ he did!

Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.

—No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....

Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:

—Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on
their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got
loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.

—For God’s sake!<eos>: 76.76855992630468
Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright.<eos>: 31.22806737611133
Is he dead?

—Dead!<eos>: 44.18665511194643
Martin Cunningham cried.<eos>: 6.38114159911743
Not he!<eos>: 20.441673210627314
A boatman got a pole and fished
him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father
on the quay more dead than alive.<eos>: 70.85088907608166
Half the town was there.

—Yes, Mr Bloom said.<eos>: 10.667051848062885
But the funny part is.....

—And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for
saving his son’s life.

A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power’s hand.

—O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed.<eos>: 42.03719351272306
Like a hero.<eos>: 9.796172693182125
A silver florin.

—Isn’t it awfully good?<eos>: 29.269642727097835
Mr Bloom said eagerly.

—One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.

Mr Power’s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.

Nelson’s pillar.

—Eight plums a penny!<eos>: 37.823203142630604
Eight for a penny!

—We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.

Mr Dedalus sighed.

—Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn’t grudge us a laugh.
Many a good one he told himself.

—The Lord forgive me!<eos>: 46.7591019541041
Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his
fingers.<eos>: 31.229995699854584
Poor Paddy!<eos>: 26.933274657095666
I little thought a week ago when I saw him last
and he was in his usual health that I’d be driving after him like this.
He’s gone from us.

—As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said.<eos>: 56.23018078878696
He went
very suddenly.

—Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said.<eos>: 12.48930077380917
Heart.

He tapped his chest sadly.

Blazing face: redhot.<eos>: 24.1139361967394
Too much John Barleycorn.<eos>: 25.07557598211393
Cure for a red nose.
Drink like the devil till it turns adelite.<eos>: 87.53874647556833
A lot of money he spent
colouring it.

Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.

—He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.

—The best death, Mr Bloom said.

Their wide open eyes looked at him.

—No suffering, he said.<eos>: 38.077716596739734
A moment and all is over.<eos>: 42.10524790181105
Like dying in sleep.

No-one spoke.

Dead side of the street this.<eos>: 92.31208287130914
Dull business by day, land agents,

Better luck next time.

—Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said.<eos>: 26.5008234992537
It’s well out of it.

The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square.<eos>: 30.46248695601663

Only a pauper.<eos>: 33.71728829728394
Nobody owns.

—In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.

—But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own
life.

Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.

—The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.

—Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively.<eos>: 26.395384108556467
We
must take a charitable view of it.

—They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.

—It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.

Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again.<eos>: 22.78824696297686
Martin Cunningham’s
large eyes.<eos>: 10.069565545857339
Looking away now.<eos>: 20.122889501267952
Sympathetic human man he is.<eos>: 27.638085351811267

Lord, she must have
looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there.<eos>: 70.38157762568392
Drunk about
the place and capering with Martin’s umbrella.

     And they call me the jewel of Asia,
     Of Asia,
     The geisha.

He looked away from me.<eos>: 37.9276828830766
He knows.<eos>: 11.752242042095013
Rattle his bones.

Nobody owns.

The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street.<eos>: 31.00344979899036
Over the stones.

—We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.

—God grant he doesn’t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.

—I hope not, Martin Cunningham said.<eos>: 17.056394825656312
That will be a great race tomorrow
in Germany.<eos>: 26.818996037712004
The Gordon Bennett.

—Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said.<eos>: 19.45612751504535
That will be worth seeing, faith.

As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent
over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls.<eos>: 74.23297340000254

He’s gone over to the
lying-in hospital they told me.<eos>: 60.613322858110514
From one extreme to the other.

The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.

—What’s wrong now?

A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching
by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony
croups.<eos>: 69.2321445635207
Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their
fear.

—Emigrants, Mr Power said.

—Huuuh!<eos>: 38.587415354338376
the drover’s voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.
Huuuh!<eos>: 16.125802678195328
out of that!

Thursday, of course.<eos>: 33.39661306856247
Tomorrow is killing day.<eos>: 28.26568652325742

lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns.<eos>: 205.20971005939236
Comes to a big thing in a

Dead meat trade.<eos>: 57.562171121648824
Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries,
soap, margarine.<eos>: 14.054644898109258
Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off
the train at Clonsilla.

The carriage moved on through the drove.

—I can’t make out why the corporation doesn’t run a tramline from the
parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said.<eos>: 47.027865602964
All those animals could be taken
in trucks down to the boats.

—Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said.<eos>: 41.749060003183715
Quite
right.<eos>: 6.63811189864246
They ought to.

—Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have
municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know.<eos>: 56.11732964652481
Run the line
out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage
and all.<eos>: 108.82146357896156
Don’t you see what I mean?

—O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said.<eos>: 15.230963197399955
Pullman car and saloon
diningroom.

—A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.

—Why?<eos>: 47.15148860375925
Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus.<eos>: 16.083169179290675
Wouldn’t it be more decent
than galloping two abreast?

—Well, there’s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.

—And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn’t have scenes like that when
the hearse capsized round Dunphy’s and upset the coffin on to the road.

—That was terrible, Mr Power’s shocked face said, and the corpse fell
about the road.<eos>: 32.868718377773696
Terrible!

—First round Dunphy’s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.<eos>: 15.934064606197152
Gordon Bennett cup.

—Praises be to God!<eos>: 57.98514785531216
Martin Cunningham said piously.

Bom!<eos>: 12.339070757695492

Mouth fallen open.<eos>: 54.47158220152176
Asking what’s up
now.<eos>: 14.651960180030892
Quite right to close it.<eos>: 24.28117981737011
Looks horrid open.<eos>: 60.360408677296455
Then the insides
decompose quickly.<eos>: 57.90211028889644
Much better to close up all the orifices.<eos>: 25.510264027793102
Yes, also.
With wax.<eos>: 59.141541759213126
The sphincter loose.<eos>: 17.51577931773055
Seal up all.

—Dunphy’s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.

Dunphy’s corner.<eos>: 38.89898178915931
Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief.<eos>: 86.7647948947316

here on the way back to drink his health.<eos>: 40.80164940770483
Pass round the consolation.
Elixir of life.

But suppose now it did happen.<eos>: 48.8340679569511
Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in
the knocking about?<eos>: 101.53431344101784
He would and he wouldn’t, I suppose.<eos>: 19.145396001622867
Depends on

Still some might ooze out of an artery.

In silence they drove along Phibsborough road.<eos>: 75.93579947223888
An empty hearse trotted
by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.

On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on
his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of
reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs.<eos>: 52.51824640514402
Athlone, Mullingar,

He lifted his

They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house.<eos>: 114.62976132980396
Near it now.

—I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.

—Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.

—How is that?<eos>: 24.12878818660062
Martin Cunningham said.<eos>: 4.497987890268049
Left him weeping, I suppose?

—Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.

The carriage steered left for Finglas road.

The stonecutter’s yard on the right.<eos>: 58.92929743510303
Last lap.<eos>: 21.41457009812192
Crowded on the spit of

Passed.

On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton’s, an old tramp sat,
grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown
yawning boot.<eos>: 46.93127802438127
After life’s journey.

Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.

Mr Power pointed.

—That is where Childs was murdered, he said.<eos>: 68.77826791707328
The last house.

—So it is, Mr Dedalus said.<eos>: 12.498976847189587
A gruesome case.<eos>: 11.518104888149033
Seymour Bushe got him off.
Murdered his brother.<eos>: 118.01867787026276
Or so they said.

—The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.

—Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added.<eos>: 27.021588582899025
That’s the maxim of the
law.<eos>: 7.165504728861142
Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent
person to be wrongfully condemned.

They looked.<eos>: 100.54056235958478
Murderer’s ground.<eos>: 6.4670889743231585
It passed darkly.<eos>: 35.596214701276466
Shuttered,
tenantless, unweeded garden.<eos>: 8.067605643115455
Whole place gone to hell.<eos>: 39.46394153712211
Wrongfully
condemned.<eos>: 2.434523058333354
Murder.<eos>: 2.0648954919576887
The murderer’s image in the eye of the murdered.
They love reading about it.<eos>: 47.24353223062264

A shoelace.<eos>: 3.4811936918257143
The body to be exhumed.
Murder will out.

Cramped in this carriage.<eos>: 69.06752525240879
She mightn’t like me to come that way without
letting her know.<eos>: 55.47450742020929
Must be careful about women.<eos>: 27.236554326310724
Catch them once with
their pants down.<eos>: 28.502363966544316
Never forgive you after.<eos>: 32.17191839525234
Fifteen.

The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze.<eos>: 49.6515053863594
Dark poplars,
rare white forms.<eos>: 42.07270757431888
Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the
trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain
gestures on the air.

The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped.<eos>: 63.24442628642248
Martin Cunningham put
out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with
his knee.<eos>: 44.798357183380105
He stepped out.<eos>: 17.46651410610263
Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.

Change that soap now.<eos>: 58.878093259055305
Mr Bloom’s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly
and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.
He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand
still held.

Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages.<eos>: 58.80923010607537
It’s all the same.
Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley.<eos>: 20.91559269287693
Pomp of death.
Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and
fruit.<eos>: 75.60590160670831
Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.
Dogbiscuits.<eos>: 121.35531306359768
Who ate them?<eos>: 21.066290979564105
Mourners coming out.

He followed his companions.<eos>: 29.4567420585902
Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes
walking after them.<eos>: 64.00869178879388
Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took
out the two wreaths.<eos>: 50.324565341151
He handed one to the boy.

Where is that child’s funeral disappeared to?

A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread,
dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a
granite block.<eos>: 53.83067362996972
The waggoner marching at their head saluted.

Coffin now.<eos>: 70.48483904502554
Got here before us, dead as he is.<eos>: 36.171423720270106
Horse looking round at
it with his plume skeowways.<eos>: 50.09364396789866
Dull eye: collar tight on his neck,
pressing on a bloodvessel or something.<eos>: 46.50879091454588
Do they know what they cart out
here every day?<eos>: 72.3542885306169
Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day.<eos>: 30.85378972282275
Then Mount
Jerome for the protestants.<eos>: 31.520011133140706
Funerals all over the world everywhere
every minute.<eos>: 51.481785008623056
Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick.
Thousands every hour.<eos>: 53.47372363597446
Too many in the world.

Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl.<eos>: 56.257490673577756
Leanjawed harpy,
hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry.<eos>: 56.16270599461209
Girl’s face stained with dirt
and tears, holding the woman’s arm, looking up at her for a sign to
cry.<eos>: 45.98681773403581
Fish’s face, bloodless and livid.

The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates.<eos>: 30.951797527712753
So
much dead weight.<eos>: 40.862903297566646
Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath.<eos>: 29.817035015268402
First
the stiff: then the friends of the stiff.<eos>: 55.328950364170375
Corny Kelleher and the boy
followed with their wreaths.<eos>: 36.77610761972462
Who is that beside them?<eos>: 31.723243393821484
Ah, the
brother-in-law.

All walked after.

Martin Cunningham whispered:

—I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.

—What?<eos>: 63.48351001263674
Mr Power whispered.<eos>: 11.204533934468687
How so?

—His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered.<eos>: 27.42838362524042
Had the
Queen’s hotel in Ennis.<eos>: 24.88150486802339
You heard him say he was going to Clare.
Anniversary.

—O God!<eos>: 39.44491793261684
Mr Power whispered.<eos>: 11.204533934468687
First I heard of it.<eos>: 24.447834658015108
Poisoned himself?

He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed
towards the cardinal’s mausoleum.<eos>: 85.5101176435586
Speaking.

—Was he insured?<eos>: 15.405330473699987
Mr Bloom asked.

—I believe so, Mr Kernan answered.<eos>: 12.89572137005169
But the policy was heavily
mortgaged.<eos>: 68.13550816485974
Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.

—How many children did he leave?

—Five.<eos>: 38.39743082904733
Ned Lambert says he’ll try to get one of the girls into Todd’s.

—A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently.<eos>: 31.774788100988502
Five young children.

—A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.

—Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.

Has the laugh at him now.

He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished.<eos>: 48.94605004289681
She had
outlived him.<eos>: 7.682736166377487
Lost her husband.<eos>: 19.353510812025885
More dead for her than for me.<eos>: 38.568771947232015
One must
outlive the other.<eos>: 18.42340439538362
Wise men say.<eos>: 21.105298369438305
There are more women than men in the
world.<eos>: 40.76693911315646
Condole with her.<eos>: 12.53509146306408
Your terrible loss.<eos>: 33.120277941506544
I hope you’ll soon follow
him.<eos>: 24.45696529083403
For Hindu widows only.<eos>: 33.34292590896125
She would marry another.<eos>: 37.976492166685446
Him?<eos>: 5.97056588135153
No.<eos>: 5.3673087592043816
Yet who
knows after.<eos>: 48.98943886018741
Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died.<eos>: 51.520815505866835
Drawn on
a guncarriage.<eos>: 6.7854602656214
Victoria and Albert.<eos>: 44.363656103158824
Frogmore memorial mourning.<eos>: 11.881437431721917
But in
the end she put a few violets in her bonnet.<eos>: 49.20347986788728
Vain in her heart of
hearts.<eos>: 36.12364007371443
All for a shadow.<eos>: 17.488958212295653
Consort not even a king.<eos>: 28.553418550441595
Her son was the
substance.<eos>: 27.777735713869735
Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back,
waiting.<eos>: 108.50797106223607
It never comes.<eos>: 22.708381145982067
One must go first: alone, under the ground:
and lie no more in her warm bed.

—How are you, Simon?<eos>: 67.78644311524229
Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands.<eos>: 31.759967104092983
Haven’t
seen you for a month of Sundays.

—Never better.<eos>: 25.27028246885398
How are all in Cork’s own town?

—I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert
said.<eos>: 51.754781615026594
Same old six and eightpence.<eos>: 37.30826468227906
Stopped with Dick Tivy.

—And how is Dick, the solid man?

—Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.

—By the holy Paul!<eos>: 62.879755154585816
Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder.<eos>: 27.169361679388217
Dick Tivy bald?

—Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said,
pointing ahead.<eos>: 22.025576823354466
A few bob a skull.<eos>: 50.10173066979225
Just to keep them going till the
insurance is cleared up.

—Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously.<eos>: 23.574863177713482
Is that the eldest boy in front?

—Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife’s brother.<eos>: 19.291638161152967
John Henry Menton is
behind.<eos>: 14.629935029055947
He put down his name for a quid.

—I’ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said.<eos>: 16.160622426369635
I often told poor Paddy he ought
to mind that job.<eos>: 81.77199063508314
John Henry is not the worst in the world.

—How did he lose it?<eos>: 25.829817661391957
Ned Lambert asked.<eos>: 14.222120122777602
Liquor, what?

—Many a good man’s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.

They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel.<eos>: 26.555322810239495
Mr Bloom stood
behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and
at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar.<eos>: 69.4398069221457
Poor boy!<eos>: 11.43934247566167
Was
he there when the father?<eos>: 57.393126710757485
Both unconscious.<eos>: 3.9304406948212804
Lighten up at the last
moment and recognise for the last time.<eos>: 25.221289234785967
All he might have done.<eos>: 21.97383592139944
I owe
three shillings to O’Grady.<eos>: 27.837869327658243
Would he understand?<eos>: 12.152447085549303
The mutes bore the
coffin into the chapel.<eos>: 25.986639622595977
Which end is his head?

After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened
light.<eos>: 65.04666691719233
The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow
candles at its corners.<eos>: 63.32168796977042
Always in front of us.<eos>: 17.010488973619175
Corny Kelleher, laying a
wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel.<eos>: 58.107810088061456
The mourners
knelt here and there in prayingdesks.<eos>: 65.65602110347723
Mr Bloom stood behind near the
font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper
from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it.<eos>: 111.22998171883944
He fitted his black
hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.

A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a
door.<eos>: 68.1692740410881
The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with
one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad’s
belly.<eos>: 39.55546083000627
Who’ll read the book?<eos>: 13.714719680971951
I, said the rook.

They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book
with a fluent croak.

Father Coffey.<eos>: 25.5012409729155
I knew his name was like a coffin.<eos>: 30.30514618597039
_Dominenamine._ Bully
about the muzzle he looks.<eos>: 30.05359210995408
Bosses the show.<eos>: 14.558843703655898
Muscular christian.<eos>: 32.881126213301506
Woe
betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest.<eos>: 219.14161724977527
Thou art Peter.<eos>: 48.67343320413489
Burst
sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will.<eos>: 107.06103777095973
With a belly on
him like a poisoned pup.<eos>: 37.66756886122839
Most amusing expressions that man finds.<eos>: 26.304949668550577
Hhhn:
burst sideways.

_—Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine._

Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin.<eos>: 55.16247642219846
Requiem
mass.<eos>: 10.955592846655428
Crape weepers.<eos>: 2.842387380473868
Blackedged notepaper.<eos>: 22.333260622410137
Your name on the altarlist.
Chilly place this.<eos>: 27.8878632105085
Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning
in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please.<eos>: 107.31994673737367
Eyes of a
toad too.<eos>: 11.660060865055682
What swells him up that way?<eos>: 36.78955377778585
Molly gets swelled after
cabbage.<eos>: 45.1156182119541
Air of the place maybe.<eos>: 24.55273297359975
Looks full up of bad gas.<eos>: 55.40649232488557
Must be an
infernal lot of bad gas round the place.<eos>: 34.99705911957312
Butchers, for instance: they
get like raw beefsteaks.<eos>: 53.364344172493276
Who was telling me?<eos>: 10.965305145232108
Mervyn Browne.<eos>: 4.032023278176116
Down in the
vaults of saint Werburgh’s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have
to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn
it.<eos>: 65.4470483195599
Out it rushes: blue.<eos>: 80.25642287649295
One whiff of that and you’re a goner.

My kneecap is hurting me.<eos>: 23.18554147397496
Ow.<eos>: 6.664093396047482
That’s better.

The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy’s
bucket and shook it over the coffin.<eos>: 27.931611541442987
Then he walked to the other end
and shook it again.<eos>: 39.03733814276939
Then he came back and put it back in the bucket.<eos>: 25.94703571522717
As
you were before you rested.<eos>: 33.816710903991115
It’s all written down: he has to do it.

_—Et ne nos inducas in tentationem._

The server piped the answers in the treble.<eos>: 34.55485209761006
I often thought it would be
better to have boy servants.<eos>: 52.53725143635198
Up to fifteen or so.<eos>: 35.53745797569421
After that, of course
...

Holy water that was, I expect.<eos>: 51.01541415633932
Shaking sleep out of it.<eos>: 15.196016189019801
He must be fed
up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.
What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over.<eos>: 63.47506930831801
Every mortal day
a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in
childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls
with little sparrows’ breasts.<eos>: 66.41200973698277
All the year round he prayed the same
thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep.<eos>: 111.32342033538244
On Dignam
now.

_—In paradisum._

Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise.<eos>: 62.27516629530436
Says that over
everybody.<eos>: 43.36583490680413
Tiresome kind of a job.<eos>: 27.10069911301381
But he has to say something.

The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server.<eos>: 38.96870896153549
Corny
Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the
coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart.<eos>: 49.04326905374438
Corny
Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law.<eos>: 49.58906503347586
All
followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air.<eos>: 44.40723921430599
Mr Bloom
came last folding his paper again into his pocket.<eos>: 54.835915978660076
He gazed gravely at
the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left.<eos>: 44.20051597212824
The metal
wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt
boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.

The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo.<eos>: 64.39576471467102
Lord, I mustn’t lilt here.

—The O’Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.

Mr Power’s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.

—He’s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O’.<eos>: 24.574146269324807
But
his heart is buried in Rome.<eos>: 41.83817303278689
How many broken hearts are buried here,
Simon!

—Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said.<eos>: 69.65289008487551
I’ll soon be stretched
beside her.<eos>: 37.9385024312346
Let Him take me whenever He likes.

Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little
in his walk.<eos>: 74.78510063717906
Mr Power took his arm.

—She’s better where she is, he said kindly.

—I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp.<eos>: 21.74545757792264
I suppose she is in
heaven if there is a heaven.

Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to
plod by.

—Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.

Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.

—The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said.<eos>: 61.01103885933132
I suppose we can
do so too.<eos>: 26.944818871008145
We are the last.<eos>: 16.444942656622047
This cemetery is a treacherous place.

They covered their heads.

—The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don’t you think?
Mr Kernan said with reproof.

Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes.<eos>: 56.67423989050913
Secret
eyes, secretsearching.<eos>: 9.051936658221875
Mason, I think: not sure.<eos>: 24.172828074134063
Beside him again.<eos>: 8.917477158132273
We
are the last.<eos>: 16.444942656622047
In the same boat.<eos>: 12.846522701082288
Hope he’ll say something else.

Mr Kernan added:

—The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more
impressive I must say.

Mr Bloom gave prudent assent.<eos>: 54.355123769965566
The language of course was another thing.

Mr Kernan said with solemnity:

—_I am the resurrection and the life_.<eos>: 30.501972894201
That touches a man’s inmost
heart.

—It does, Mr Bloom said.

Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two
with his toes to the daisies?<eos>: 54.697174551738826
No touching that.<eos>: 30.092486200291635
Seat of the affections.
Broken heart.<eos>: 21.31538619898508
A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood
every day.<eos>: 92.11584798761297
One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are.<eos>: 71.42768055938824
Lots of
them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers.<eos>: 64.09771406097676
Old rusty pumps: damn
the thing else.<eos>: 62.73582208146633
The resurrection and the life.<eos>: 10.44454351237081
Once you are dead you
are dead.<eos>: 58.88715482738673
That last day idea.<eos>: 38.03474085911695
Knocking them all up out of their graves.
Come forth, Lazarus!<eos>: 28.015217393436224
And he came fifth and lost the job.<eos>: 60.19463605274521
Get up!<eos>: 22.083642778706178
Last
day!<eos>: 14.927663105595958
Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and
the rest of his traps.<eos>: 42.570800215160745
Find damn all of himself that morning.
Pennyweight of powder in a skull.<eos>: 34.559862291557266
Twelve grammes one pennyweight.<eos>: 10.376131662930113
Troy
measure.

Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.

—Everything went off A1, he said.<eos>: 47.637152759200276
What?

He looked on them from his drawling eye.<eos>: 16.5481102442727
Policeman’s shoulders.<eos>: 6.430044024197649
With
your tooraloom tooraloom.

—As it should be, Mr Kernan said.

—What?<eos>: 19.058126591832504
Eh?<eos>: 8.027425029092774
Corny Kelleher said.

Mr Kernan assured him.

—Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan?<eos>: 34.363081461136666
John Henry Menton asked.<eos>: 7.6001987656826655
I
know his face.

Ned Lambert glanced back.

—Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the
soprano.<eos>: 33.88606612753767
She’s his wife.

—O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said.<eos>: 12.546210203437367
I haven’t seen her for some
time.<eos>: 21.135528203865274
She was a finelooking woman.<eos>: 11.098130832843871
I danced with her, wait, fifteen
seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon’s in Roundtown.<eos>: 75.06724252831208
And a good
armful she was.

He looked behind through the others.

—What is he?<eos>: 22.254504263160896
he asked.<eos>: 5.051942343743682
What does he do?<eos>: 14.487839524298895
Wasn’t he in the stationery
line?<eos>: 14.212752006725333
I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.

Ned Lambert smiled.

—Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely’s.<eos>: 30.92017148974989
A traveller for blottingpaper.

—In God’s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like
that for?<eos>: 28.681439592486967
She had plenty of game in her then.

—Has still, Ned Lambert said.<eos>: 39.270542700312106
He does some canvassing for ads.

John Henry Menton’s large eyes stared ahead.

The barrow turned into a side lane.<eos>: 45.22536565491943
A portly man, ambushed among the
grasses, raised his hat in homage.<eos>: 19.336097715610734
The gravediggers touched their caps.

—John O’Connell, Mr Power said pleased.<eos>: 42.31052221692324
He never forgets a friend.

Mr O’Connell shook all their hands in silence.<eos>: 40.19767473943669
Mr Dedalus said:

—I am come to pay you another visit.

—My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice.<eos>: 47.94088650693785
I don’t want
your custom at all.

Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin
Cunningham’s side puzzling two long keys at his back.

—Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?

—I did not, Martin Cunningham said.

They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear.<eos>: 53.756752384863375
The
caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke
in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.

—They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy
evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs.<eos>: 62.87120506576966
They asked for
Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried.<eos>: 48.75764229382632
After
traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough.<eos>: 71.22401179803298
One of the
drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy.<eos>: 17.807799659604157
The other drunk was
blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.

The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed.<eos>: 82.2243620694051
He
resumed:

—And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like
the man_, says he.<eos>: 46.04841466632947
_That’s not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_.

Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher,
accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as
he walked.

—That’s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.

—I know, Hynes said.<eos>: 34.13002257992369
I know that.

—To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said.<eos>: 26.463488755135497
It’s pure
goodheartedness: damn the thing else.

Mr Bloom admired the caretaker’s prosperous bulk.<eos>: 30.713212759387055
All want to be on
good terms with him.<eos>: 32.72906923294163
Decent fellow, John O’Connell, real good sort.
Keys: like Keyes’s ad: no fear of anyone getting out.<eos>: 84.98456757047745
No passout
checks.<eos>: 5.234456126202684
_Habeas corpus_.<eos>: 2.842387380473868
I must see about that ad after the funeral.
Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she
disturbed me writing to Martha?<eos>: 70.60055608933465
Hope it’s not chucked in the dead
letter office.<eos>: 21.36340161841843
Be the better of a shave.<eos>: 33.509387421984876
Grey sprouting beard.<eos>: 12.325815225725304
That’s
the first sign when the hairs come out grey.<eos>: 77.9453056903936
And temper getting cross.
Silver threads among the grey.<eos>: 149.99899304600024
Fancy being his wife.<eos>: 22.357750634302676
Wonder he had the
gumption to propose to any girl.<eos>: 21.655960878735065
Come out and live in the graveyard.
Dangle that before her.<eos>: 23.301936314380608
It might thrill her first.<eos>: 79.05087041463182
Courting death.
Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about.<eos>: 73.39923968705072
The
shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O’Connell must be
a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy
man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark.<eos>: 58.10986103203108
Will o’
the wisp.<eos>: 14.496987408771773
Gas of graves.<eos>: 8.564169853654976
Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at
all.<eos>: 34.6281606952079
Women especially are so touchy.<eos>: 46.441501331263524
Tell her a ghost story in bed to
make her sleep.<eos>: 41.04230746539415
Have you ever seen a ghost?<eos>: 27.541236977210765
Well, I have.<eos>: 7.485265385538051
It was a
pitchdark night.<eos>: 12.850326010633982
The clock was on the stroke of twelve.<eos>: 42.46215727337424
Still they’d
kiss all right if properly keyed up.<eos>: 50.19887369529504
Whores in Turkish graveyards.
Learn anything if taken young.<eos>: 110.92567224497019
You might pick up a young widow here.
Men like that.<eos>: 80.49788709941761
Love among the tombstones.<eos>: 7.062899916412352
Romeo.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Spice of pleasure.<eos>: 13.213828880301218
In
the midst of death we are in life.<eos>: 38.53049081500606
Both ends meet.<eos>: 54.86150173742401
Tantalising for the
poor dead.<eos>: 24.067201040236352
Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving.<eos>: 12.710137917604037
Gnawing their
vitals.<eos>: 7.138775531057475
Desire to grig people.<eos>: 10.577478360178903
Molly wanting to do it at the window.
Eight children he has anyway.

He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field
after field.<eos>: 135.60720271985474
Holy fields.<eos>: 19.77755668144274
More room if they buried them standing.
Sitting or kneeling you couldn’t.<eos>: 82.8047193839503
Standing?<eos>: 8.759046216297897
His head might come up some
day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing.<eos>: 89.04332299586513
All honeycombed
the ground must be: oblong cells.<eos>: 22.520912962528623
And very neat he keeps it too: trim
grass and edgings.<eos>: 59.723019025102325
His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome.<eos>: 59.19082021490089
Well, so
it is.<eos>: 10.268940331030457
Ought to be flowers of sleep.<eos>: 32.62074858870785
Chinese cemeteries with giant
poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me.<eos>: 120.19077094651479
The Botanic
Gardens are just over there.<eos>: 47.31838161312978
It’s the blood sinking in the earth gives
new life.<eos>: 62.23684459206421
Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy.
Every man his price.<eos>: 225.67261308083164
Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure,
invaluable for fruit garden.<eos>: 62.182029619085284
A bargain.<eos>: 24.757972850584615
By carcass of William
Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds
thirteen and six.<eos>: 56.46029513316924
With thanks.

I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh,
nails.<eos>: 87.93042518022489
Charnelhouses.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Dreadful.<eos>: 5.117848519794139
Turning green and pink decomposing.<eos>: 24.78790147898934
Rot
quick in damp earth.<eos>: 49.99957054473321
The lean old ones tougher.<eos>: 53.20775005246381
Then a kind of a
tallowy kind of a cheesy.<eos>: 16.16050917213445
Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing
out of them.<eos>: 35.97564431455858
Then dried up.<eos>: 13.884331245799403
Deathmoths.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Of course the cells or whatever
they are go on living.<eos>: 47.97853172196818
Changing about.<eos>: 24.881431901910027
Live for ever practically.
Nothing to feed on feed on themselves.

But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots.<eos>: 63.674224184442274
Soil must be simply
swirling with them.<eos>: 51.64923508528785
Your head it simply swurls.<eos>: 27.527913691335577
Those pretty little
seaside gurls.<eos>: 36.116286014892125
He looks cheerful enough over it.<eos>: 35.586381132863494
Gives him a sense of
power seeing all the others go under first.<eos>: 77.15778417874678
Wonder how he looks at
life.<eos>: 35.471703761108444
Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart.<eos>: 33.704228844666936
The one
about the bulletin.<eos>: 13.76215112964616

Peter.<eos>: 5.680793396764956
The dead themselves the
men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what’s
in fashion.<eos>: 122.73536304614308
A juicy pear or ladies’ punch, hot, strong and sweet.<eos>: 79.06652698452879
Keep
out the damp.<eos>: 20.977976813052635
You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.
Gravediggers in _Hamlet_.<eos>: 151.9047318292559

Go out of mourning first.<eos>: 26.17626459724847
Hard to imagine his funeral.
Seems a sort of a joke.<eos>: 82.97761952933817
Read your own obituary notice they say you live
longer.<eos>: 61.36339841951141
Gives you second wind.<eos>: 50.51948728416507
New lease of life.

—How many have you for tomorrow?<eos>: 31.645512366569484
the caretaker asked.

—Two, Corny Kelleher said.<eos>: 24.15770443250315
Half ten and eleven.

The caretaker put the papers in his pocket.<eos>: 30.670207595171977
The barrow had ceased to
trundle.<eos>: 30.316430246380296
The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole,
stepping with care round the graves.<eos>: 56.467840630586856
The gravediggers bore the coffin
and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.

Burying him.<eos>: 42.19481117208678
We come to bury Cæsar.<eos>: 18.90321876743476
His ides of March or June.<eos>: 65.75620467778332
He
doesn’t know who is here nor care.<eos>: 36.54130736555349
Now who is that lankylooking galoot
over there in the macintosh?<eos>: 33.907607034688894
Now who is he I’d like to know?<eos>: 25.34846282714827
Now I’d
give a trifle to know who he is.<eos>: 16.178630005511852
Always someone turns up you never
dreamt of.<eos>: 82.92121417396149
A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life.<eos>: 32.145999750502675
Yes, he
could.<eos>: 11.554829182581825
Still he’d have to get someone to sod him after he died though
he could dig his own grave.<eos>: 50.216322490043105
We all do.<eos>: 22.24389448789718
Only man buries.<eos>: 13.808245094980801
No, ants too.
First thing strikes anybody.<eos>: 79.34615937879
Bury the dead.<eos>: 8.206686002779714
Say Robinson Crusoe was
true to life.<eos>: 52.56518059815821
Well then Friday buried him.<eos>: 62.265548713700014
Every Friday buries a
Thursday if you come to look at it.

     O, poor Robinson Crusoe!
     How could you possibly do so?

Poor Dignam!<eos>: 60.9428751581172
His last lie on the earth in his box.<eos>: 33.20001546933744
When you think of
them all it does seem a waste of wood.<eos>: 63.77485649668261
All gnawed through.<eos>: 14.071309747006651
They could
invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that
way.<eos>: 63.31939413119492
Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow’s.
They’re so particular.<eos>: 57.0339746953184
Lay me in my native earth.<eos>: 38.67722658731442
Bit of clay from the
holy land.<eos>: 29.878660488409924
Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one
coffin.<eos>: 69.0574799482182
I see what it means.<eos>: 28.32327940251895
I see.<eos>: 6.544549756885207
To protect him as long as possible
even in the earth.<eos>: 47.84181820095823
The Irishman’s house is his coffin.<eos>: 29.027791767513737
Embalming in
catacombs, mummies the same idea.

Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.
Twelve.<eos>: 37.77858266463923
I’m thirteen.<eos>: 14.240610958801412
No.<eos>: 5.3673087592043816
The chap in the macintosh is thirteen.
Death’s number.<eos>: 84.0028657679446
Where the deuce did he pop out of?<eos>: 36.47546083306888
He wasn’t in the
chapel, that I’ll swear.<eos>: 22.204857178538866
Silly superstition that about thirteen.

Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit.<eos>: 139.99125143721554
Tinge of purple.<eos>: 18.451116677642634
I had
one like that when we lived in Lombard street west.<eos>: 25.92403505108146
Dressy fellow he
was once.<eos>: 30.783576365965644
Used to change three suits in the day.<eos>: 54.47374328738476
Must get that grey
suit of mine turned by Mesias.<eos>: 102.67132511260829
Hello.<eos>: 13.159053129147367
It’s dyed.<eos>: 3.244080402525879
His wife I forgot he’s
not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for
him.

The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the
gravetrestles.<eos>: 42.26003518608044
They struggled up and out: and all uncovered.<eos>: 25.13400163750354
Twenty.

Pause.

If we were all suddenly somebody else.

Far away a donkey brayed.<eos>: 88.34771424522066
Rain.<eos>: 4.196591327857199
No such ass.<eos>: 38.914860286613624
Never see a dead one, they
say.<eos>: 27.107387948185398
Shame of death.<eos>: 9.164192793334276
They hide.<eos>: 16.47742830264472
Also poor papa went away.

Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper.<eos>: 145.66580782506753
Whisper.<eos>: 1.808650224977277
The
boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in
the black open space.<eos>: 100.01598887052822
Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly
caretaker.<eos>: 36.5023635818918
Wellcut frockcoat.<eos>: 21.97692675728038
Weighing them up perhaps to see which
will go next.<eos>: 87.37884361037872
Well, it is a long rest.<eos>: 20.2981904842451
Feel no more.<eos>: 11.273512846714382
It’s the moment
you feel.<eos>: 18.78332317900066
Must be damned unpleasant.<eos>: 25.042412367873187
Can’t believe it at first.<eos>: 15.861312290207241
Mistake
must be: someone else.<eos>: 34.57474435709514
Try the house opposite.<eos>: 35.02718132266052
Wait, I wanted to.<eos>: 11.720502727691676
I
haven’t yet.<eos>: 14.446306357415619
Then darkened deathchamber.<eos>: 17.025584415443642
Light they want.<eos>: 20.182661120370465
Whispering
around you.<eos>: 28.86277327553213
Would you like to see a priest?<eos>: 21.075994635339256
Then rambling and
wandering.<eos>: 28.76118999900165
Delirium all you hid all your life.<eos>: 59.61734611312226
The death struggle.<eos>: 11.798650413557308
His
sleep is not natural.<eos>: 33.34138978399935
Press his lower eyelid.<eos>: 25.238944796540032
Watching is his nose
pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow.<eos>: 160.04310126426958
Pull the
pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he’s doomed.<eos>: 32.91650909258902
Devil in
that picture of sinner’s death showing him a woman.<eos>: 42.89059451902555
Dying to embrace
her in his shirt.<eos>: 33.411229609436795
Last act of _Lucia.<eos>: 7.677665538349302
Shall I nevermore behold thee_?
Bam!<eos>: 16.922240318886658
He expires.<eos>: 4.799424088923303
Gone at last.<eos>: 21.656506461989014
People talk about you a bit: forget you.
Don’t forget to pray for him.<eos>: 43.93446990736239
Remember him in your prayers.<eos>: 22.771701310299825
Even
Parnell.<eos>: 22.685009683438036
Ivy day dying out.<eos>: 116.08247295349244
Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one
after the other.

We are praying now for the repose of his soul.<eos>: 67.35402856731758
Hoping you’re well and
not in hell.<eos>: 21.946973440576063
Nice change of air.<eos>: 15.946601015026237
Out of the fryingpan of life into the
fire of purgatory.

Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself?<eos>: 36.430656260280685
They say you do
when you shiver in the sun.<eos>: 22.540687595090002
Someone walking over it.<eos>: 26.28973266450109
Callboy’s warning.
Near you.<eos>: 39.656826230009024
Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought.<eos>: 40.30569088323627
Mamma,
poor mamma, and little Rudy.

The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in
on the coffin.<eos>: 76.46939335050031
Mr Bloom turned away his face.<eos>: 19.806988705462675
And if he was alive all
the time?<eos>: 28.64141710526474
Whew!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
By jingo, that would be awful!<eos>: 51.075876935101135
No, no: he is dead, of
course.<eos>: 25.242600652053415
Of course he is dead.<eos>: 18.695417609245062
Monday he died.<eos>: 13.499400834351931
They ought to have some
law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a
telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole.<eos>: 59.11371932009793
Flag of
distress.<eos>: 4.850797588666444
Three days.<eos>: 14.57866518365494
Rather long to keep them in summer.<eos>: 50.33225231306362
Just as well
to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there’s no.

The clay fell softer.<eos>: 60.102062510792315
Begin to be forgotten.<eos>: 12.861810305338476
Out of sight, out of mind.

The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat.<eos>: 48.38474361689397
Had enough of
it.<eos>: 17.701014960718112
The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves
without show.<eos>: 161.1980161733806
Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make
its way deftly through the maze of graves.<eos>: 39.35419461648329
Quietly, sure of his ground,
he traversed the dismal fields.

Hynes jotting down something in his notebook.<eos>: 38.46687756233682
Ah, the names.<eos>: 12.492590094109367
But he
knows them all.<eos>: 17.484767974765735
No: coming to me.

—I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath.<eos>: 42.6563904692324
What is your
christian name?<eos>: 20.586368141782394
I’m not sure.

—L, Mr Bloom said.<eos>: 10.930182249652145
Leopold.<eos>: 4.183781924656778
And you might put down M’Coy’s name too.<eos>: 32.16021241617569
He
asked me to.

—Charley, Hynes said writing.<eos>: 37.504567087551095
I know.<eos>: 6.268577991865942
He was on the _Freeman_ once.

So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne.<eos>: 56.024925108703826
Good
idea a postmortem for doctors.<eos>: 29.62433044796156
Find out what they imagine they know.<eos>: 59.29352051877082
He
died of a Tuesday.<eos>: 25.413188009093066
Got the run.<eos>: 14.687481117501337
Levanted with the cash of a few ads.
Charley, you’re my darling.<eos>: 57.52766953926855
That was why he asked me to.<eos>: 23.12327492284746
O well, does
no harm.<eos>: 49.27894931650097
I saw to that, M’Coy.<eos>: 14.585233364502171
Thanks, old chap: much obliged.<eos>: 49.75682924416064
Leave
him under an obligation: costs nothing.

—And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was
over there in the...

He looked around.

—Macintosh.<eos>: 46.955734788523785
Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said.<eos>: 7.543605076564229
Where is he now?

—M’Intosh, Hynes said scribbling.<eos>: 17.74423165354578
I don’t know who he is.<eos>: 10.543893275926246
Is that his
name?

He moved away, looking about him.

—No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping.<eos>: 26.376749204747068
I say, Hynes!

Didn’t hear.<eos>: 25.523864565027417
What?<eos>: 3.8546952873351206
Where has he disappeared to?<eos>: 32.7565622895004
Not a sign.<eos>: 18.45082809965957
Well of all
the.<eos>: 20.88183065601447
Has anybody here seen?<eos>: 64.78799512147246
Kay ee double ell.<eos>: 31.40485302914899
Become invisible.<eos>: 16.01714969482532
Good
Lord, what became of him?

A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.

—O, excuse me!

He stepped aside nimbly.

Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole.<eos>: 54.85632960373312
It rose.<eos>: 8.829389417555149
Nearly over.
A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested
their spades.<eos>: 68.59156564985477
All uncovered again for a few instants.<eos>: 16.006247272207894
The boy propped
his wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump.<eos>: 95.54972456904488
The
gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards
the barrow.<eos>: 73.15935015585235
Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean.<eos>: 47.391768114006624
One
bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass.<eos>: 46.37555757534738
One, leaving his
mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.
Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband.<eos>: 55.725025040811964
His navelcord.
The brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.
Thanks in silence.<eos>: 53.32558958810192
Sorry, sir: trouble.<eos>: 21.085609557940874
Headshake.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
I know that.<eos>: 9.508848860775032
For
yourselves just.

The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying
at whiles to read a name on a tomb.

—Let us go round by the chief’s grave, Hynes said.<eos>: 33.36074572384063
We have time.

—Let us, Mr Power said.

They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts.<eos>: 34.73398506718967
With awe Mr
Power’s blank voice spoke:

—Some say he is not in that grave at all.<eos>: 67.78123131693826
That the coffin was filled
with stones.<eos>: 56.60074718550285
That one day he will come again.

Hynes shook his head.

—Parnell will never come again, he said.<eos>: 43.49198074937347
He’s there, all that was
mortal of him.<eos>: 35.667208406388745
Peace to his ashes.

Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses,
broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes,
old Ireland’s hearts and hands.<eos>: 59.03757058283046
More sensible to spend the money on
some charity for the living.<eos>: 33.78790250886541
Pray for the repose of the soul of.<eos>: 20.586516859950603
Does
anybody really?<eos>: 29.517988212063596
Plant him and have done with him.<eos>: 22.32355793843502
Like down a
coalshoot.<eos>: 9.592898873268483
Then lump them together to save time.<eos>: 105.74945085519768
All souls’ day.
Twentyseventh I’ll be at his grave.<eos>: 35.83822852634831
Ten shillings for the gardener.<eos>: 18.86485142536903
He
keeps it free of weeds.<eos>: 66.35658666733242
Old man himself.<eos>: 18.018345242189323
Bent down double with his
shears clipping.<eos>: 73.09998455849252
Near death’s door.<eos>: 13.059485806396285
Who passed away.<eos>: 20.36777064361608
Who departed this
life.<eos>: 67.6506887094298
As if they did it of their own accord.<eos>: 33.205830273417085
Got the shove, all of
them.<eos>: 34.255566614886746
Who kicked the bucket.<eos>: 23.31293492548848
More interesting if they told you what
they were.<eos>: 40.036568138233065
So and So, wheelwright.<eos>: 15.780907877478425
I travelled for cork lino.<eos>: 39.950432929161465
I paid
five shillings in the pound.<eos>: 27.819140301807295
Or a woman’s with her saucepan.<eos>: 12.934649589791391
I cooked
good Irish stew.<eos>: 42.55663714318459
Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that
poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell.<eos>: 68.63899162380496
Entered into rest
the protestants put it.<eos>: 80.75509048379
Old Dr Murren’s.<eos>: 11.70346139240416
The great physician called him
home.<eos>: 33.383806455168354
Well it’s God’s acre for them.<eos>: 11.798935000589816
Nice country residence.<eos>: 58.525680288607845
Newly
plastered and painted.<eos>: 92.16569793575802
Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the
_Church Times._ Marriage ads they never try to beautify.<eos>: 89.73539022037255
Rusty wreaths
hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil.<eos>: 19.089253829861953
Better value that for the money.
Still, the flowers are more poetical.<eos>: 86.9189730587895
The other gets rather tiresome,
never withering.<eos>: 52.215141728931364
Expresses nothing.<eos>: 13.032306503026573
Immortelles.

A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch.<eos>: 48.018292461099826
Like stuffed.<eos>: 33.98055422360174
Like the
wedding present alderman Hooper gave us.<eos>: 136.27900275273407
Hoo!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
Not a budge out of him.
Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him.<eos>: 36.224910855464024
Dead animal even
sadder.<eos>: 36.0931222107989
Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen
matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.

The Sacred Heart that is: showing it.<eos>: 71.63049528663889
Heart on his sleeve.<eos>: 12.938177185100013
Ought to be
sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart.<eos>: 96.38244594707298
Ireland was
dedicated to it or whatever that.<eos>: 28.040304228489585
Seems anything but pleased.<eos>: 50.735206913129346
Why this
infliction?<eos>: 10.62485419099784
Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket
of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the
boy.<eos>: 59.55912796039546
Apollo that was.

How many!<eos>: 38.795905196802835
All these here once walked round Dublin.<eos>: 227.56684835515486
Faithful departed.
As you are now so once were we.

Besides how could you remember everybody?<eos>: 117.49483238475936
Eyes, walk, voice.<eos>: 37.05854014217652
Well, the
voice, yes: gramophone.<eos>: 30.02907432863898
Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in
the house.<eos>: 48.67424089453085
After dinner on a Sunday.<eos>: 37.51176051034456
Put on poor old greatgrandfather.
Kraahraark!<eos>: 26.74293006038877
Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain
hellohello amawf krpthsth.<eos>: 3.52501550307334
Remind you of the voice like the photograph
reminds you of the face.<eos>: 63.08384304136192
Otherwise you couldn’t remember the face after
fifteen years, say.<eos>: 43.02823209372379
For instance who?<eos>: 31.934104500052968
For instance some fellow that
died when I was in Wisdom Hely’s.

Rtststr!<eos>: 37.64772472584287
A rattle of pebbles.<eos>: 27.35025775401779
Wait.<eos>: 2.366011761982759
Stop!

He looked down intently into a stone crypt.<eos>: 25.245193671622577
Some animal.<eos>: 22.26951968156696
Wait.<eos>: 2.366011761982759
There he
goes.

An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the
pebbles.<eos>: 37.39691473968996
An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes.<eos>: 23.94982977439608
The grey
alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.
Good hidingplace for treasure.

Who lives there?<eos>: 123.70189702957376
Are laid the remains of Robert Emery.<eos>: 48.552593880700066
Robert Emmet was
buried here by torchlight, wasn’t he?<eos>: 31.13412100416495
Making his rounds.

Tail gone now.

One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow.<eos>: 207.73567374039558
Pick the bones
clean no matter who it was.<eos>: 113.34606812304136
Ordinary meat for them.<eos>: 24.331594221779294
A corpse is meat
gone bad.<eos>: 141.00622253829218
Well and what’s cheese?<eos>: 19.18825278798335
Corpse of milk.<eos>: 18.02948711659369
I read in that
_Voyages in China_ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a
corpse.<eos>: 96.74703502162144
Cremation better.<eos>: 16.684790074939
Priests dead against it.<eos>: 34.07462083271364
Devilling for the
other firm.<eos>: 15.525921779720823
Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers.<eos>: 3.6317958149241862
Time of the
plague.<eos>: 11.249915805404804
Quicklime feverpits to eat them.<eos>: 15.357054485870844
Lethal chamber.<eos>: 22.313341954252415
Ashes to
ashes.<eos>: 15.258736227748782
Or bury at sea.<eos>: 41.368835094515305
Where is that Parsee tower of silence?<eos>: 47.095902009778634
Eaten by
birds.<eos>: 38.885241261347474
Earth, fire, water.<eos>: 21.034914539127545
Drowning they say is the pleasantest.<eos>: 16.317862694277043
See
your whole life in a flash.<eos>: 54.205833225809066
But being brought back to life no.<eos>: 70.20544338109406
Can’t
bury in the air however.<eos>: 19.67477312502348
Out of a flying machine.<eos>: 39.47655690499575
Wonder does the news
go about whenever a fresh one is let down.<eos>: 139.33525130920827
Underground communication.
We learned that from them.<eos>: 46.432512583083856
Wouldn’t be surprised.<eos>: 7.282588565388799
Regular square feed
for them.<eos>: 49.771091686628985
Flies come before he’s well dead.<eos>: 28.798323069668488
Got wind of Dignam.<eos>: 24.503568575755203
They
wouldn’t care about the smell of it.<eos>: 12.022578996264963
Saltwhite crumbling mush of
corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.

The gates glimmered in front: still open.<eos>: 92.89547607613453
Back to the world again.
Enough of this place.<eos>: 34.58220119105447
Brings you a bit nearer every time.<eos>: 52.62818168116305
Last time I
was here was Mrs Sinico’s funeral.<eos>: 27.25166043522113
Poor papa too.<eos>: 22.303601188159544
The love that kills.
And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I
read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running
gravesores.<eos>: 114.36203408478318
Give you the creeps after a bit.<eos>: 17.55241532185943
I will appear to you after
death.<eos>: 46.158623799414514
You will see my ghost after death.<eos>: 50.0194750956512
My ghost will haunt you after
death.<eos>: 67.43823609679035

I do not like

No more do I.<eos>: 33.26519034638831
Plenty to see and hear and

Warm beds:
warm fullblooded life.

Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.

Solicitor, I think.<eos>: 55.47054855690076
I know his face.<eos>: 13.895539860224932
Menton, John Henry, solicitor,

Heart of gold really.<eos>: 41.34270613760447
Yes, Menton.<eos>: 16.48994462051785
Got
his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside
him.<eos>: 61.23789032575915
Pure fluke of mine: the bias.<eos>: 12.933891530496929

Got a dinge in the side of his hat.<eos>: 51.27800715811207
Carriage probably.

—Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.

They stopped.

—Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.

John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.

—There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.

John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed
the nap with care on his coatsleeve.<eos>: 31.129882661000465
He clapped the hat on his head
again.

—It’s all right now, Martin Cunningham said.

John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.

—Thank you, he said shortly.

They walked on towards the gates.<eos>: 19.674150012825095
Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a
few paces so as not to overhear.<eos>: 32.541899100833234

IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS


Before Nelson’s pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started
for Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure,
Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines,
Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Harold’s Cross.<eos>: 41.99406303067643
The hoarse Dublin United
Tramway Company’s timekeeper bawled them off:

—Rathgar and Terenure!

—Come on, Sandymount Green!

Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a
singledeck moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glided
parallel.

—Start, Palmerston Park!

THE WEARER OF THE CROWN


Under the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and
polished.<eos>: 56.518962417235926
Parked in North Prince’s street His Majesty’s vermilion

GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS

On the brewery float bumped
dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince’s

—There it is, Red Murray said.<eos>: 52.55132921935251
Alexander Keyes.

—Just cut it out, will you?<eos>: 35.93647166970809
Mr Bloom said, and I’ll take it round to
the _Telegraph_ office.

The door of Ruttledge’s office creaked again.<eos>: 21.25387620267687
Davy Stephens, minute in
a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out
with a roll of papers under his cape, a king’s courier.

Red Murray’s long shears sliced out the advertisement from the
newspaper in four clean strokes.<eos>: 69.57710508424009
Scissors and paste.

—I’ll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut
square.

—Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind
his ear, we can do him one.

—Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod.<eos>: 24.846249218656038
I’ll rub that in.

We.

WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT


Red Murray touched Mr Bloom’s arm with the shears and whispered:

—Brayden.

Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a
stately figure entered between the newsboards of the _Weekly Freeman
and National Press_ and the _Freeman’s Journal and National Press_.
Dullthudding Guinness’s barrels.<eos>: 37.218222872115

Fat folds of neck,

—Don’t you think his face is like Our Saviour?<eos>: 57.882690216468504
Red Murray whispered.

The door of Ruttledge’s office whispered: ee: cree.<eos>: 29.547911292023496

Mary, Martha.
Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.

—Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.

—Yes, Red Murray agreed.<eos>: 35.7657873356655
But Mario was said to be the picture of Our
Saviour.

     Co-ome thou dear one!

THE CROZIER AND THE PEN


—His grace phoned down twice this morning, Red Murray said gravely.

They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish.<eos>: 99.47431210199656
Neck.

A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and
stepped off posthaste with a word:

_—Freeman!_

Mr Bloom said slowly:

—Well, he is one of our saviours also.

A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed
in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along
the now reverberating boards.<eos>: 56.861570242229874
But will he save the circulation?
Thumping.<eos>: 55.59953506158005
Thumping.

He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn
packing paper.<eos>: 44.46325236132257
Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards
Nannetti’s reading closet.

Working away, tearing away.<eos>: 50.051095045239045
And that old grey rat tearing
to get in.

HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT


Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman’s spare body, admiring a glossy
crown.

Strange he never saw his real country.<eos>: 114.12400174386856

—Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.

Soon be calling him my lord mayor.<eos>: 67.9342587691089
Long John is backing him, they say.

The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the
sheet and made a sign to a typesetter.<eos>: 53.996161188015016
He handed the sheet silently
over the dirty glass screen.

—Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.

Mr Bloom stood in his way.

—If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said,
pointing backward with his thumb.

—Did you?<eos>: 46.57500476811289
Hynes asked.

—Mm, Mr Bloom said.<eos>: 6.989039783318691
Look sharp and you’ll catch him.

—Thanks, old man, Hynes said.<eos>: 27.28619986700112
I’ll tap him too.

He hurried on eagerly towards the _Freeman’s Journal_.

Three bob I lent him in Meagher’s.<eos>: 28.042640456566414

Third hint.

WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK


Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti’s desk.

—Excuse me, councillor, he said.<eos>: 37.50382224198871
This ad, you see.<eos>: 21.561520106820907
Keyes, you remember?

Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.

—He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.

The foreman moved his pencil towards it.

—But wait, Mr Bloom said.<eos>: 33.85445335077172
He wants it changed.<eos>: 24.44420204770969
Keyes, you see.<eos>: 9.626655106022012
He wants
two keys at the top.

Hell of a racket they make.<eos>: 78.42355695959202
He doesn’t hear it.<eos>: 9.753772577410032
Nannan.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Iron nerves.
Maybe he understands what I.

The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began
to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.

—Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.

Let him take that in first.

Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the
foreman’s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the
obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper.<eos>: 55.08349778175985
Clank it.<eos>: 8.009752059478682
Clank it.<eos>: 8.009752059478682
Miles
of it unreeled.<eos>: 8.335423405225482
What becomes of it after?<eos>: 51.027341799541176
O, wrap up meat, parcels:
various uses, thousand and one things.

Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew
swiftly on the scarred woodwork.

HOUSE OF KEY(E)S


—Like that, see.<eos>: 99.2046015456349
Two crossed keys here.<eos>: 112.97068347307884
A circle.<eos>: 15.808836186297219
Then here the name.
Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant.<eos>: 130.77883564089257
So on.

Better not teach him his own business.

—You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants.<eos>: 58.53014677688515
Then round the top
in leaded: the house of keys.<eos>: 25.887846614944312
You see?<eos>: 9.045799342887129
Do you think that’s a good idea?

The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched
there quietly.

—The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys.<eos>: 30.774736963091886
You know, councillor,
the Manx parliament.<eos>: 28.131395748178825
Innuendo of home rule.<eos>: 49.70892203960883
Tourists, you know, from
the isle of Man.<eos>: 26.364323069120747
Catches the eye, you see.<eos>: 17.115132078842567
Can you do that?

I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that _voglio._ But then
if he didn’t know only make it awkward for him.<eos>: 38.26293392367528
Better not.

—We can do that, the foreman said.<eos>: 19.31557932529442
Have you the design?

—I can get it, Mr Bloom said.<eos>: 12.88797235466541
It was in a Kilkenny paper.<eos>: 31.21412919994343
He has a
house there too.<eos>: 40.10283935991758
I’ll just run out and ask him.<eos>: 20.708911912006503
Well, you can do that
and just a little par calling attention.<eos>: 50.86578557931082
You know the usual.<eos>: 18.095954673194246
Highclass
licensed premises.<eos>: 44.88221759975332
Longfelt want.<eos>: 21.23481915150761
So on.

The foreman thought for an instant.

—We can do that, he said.<eos>: 19.72412876470493
Let him give us a three months’ renewal.

A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage.<eos>: 44.72484342842483
He began to check it
silently.<eos>: 41.779335356969575
Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks,
watching the silent typesetters at their cases.

ORTHOGRAPHICAL


Want to be sure of his spelling.<eos>: 32.100573824715624

NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR


The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying:

—Wait.<eos>: 25.992410670613783
Where’s the archbishop’s letter?<eos>: 16.216857268465567
It’s to be repeated in the
_Telegraph._ Where’s what’s his name?

He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.

—Monks, sir?<eos>: 25.59830030745416
a voice asked from the castingbox.

—Ay.<eos>: 16.011760645446763
Where’s Monks?

—Monks!

Mr Bloom took up his cutting.<eos>: 23.96020676930818
Time to get out.

—Then I’ll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you’ll give it a
good place I know.

—Monks!

—Yes, sir.

Three months’ renewal.<eos>: 25.500019642001348

A DAYFATHER


He walked on through the caseroom passing an old man, bowed,
spectacled, aproned.<eos>: 39.21338860486848
Old Monks, the dayfather.<eos>: 11.215946183019724
Queer lot of stuff he
must have put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs’
ads, speeches, divorce suits, found drowned.<eos>: 46.520641149844344
Nearing the end of his
tether now.<eos>: 14.297953392337416

AND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER


He stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type.
Reads it backwards first.<eos>: 76.03608092347237
Quickly he does it.<eos>: 23.28735329076679

Then the twelve brothers, Jacob’s sons.
And then the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water

And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he
kills the ox and the dog kills the cat.<eos>: 83.06911809213196

Practice makes perfect.<eos>: 85.23977261561542
Seems to see with his fingers.

Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to
the landing.<eos>: 30.227982906269297
Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch

ONLY ONCE MORE THAT SOAP


He went down the house staircase.<eos>: 113.71594328176295
Who the deuce scrawled all over those
walls with matches?<eos>: 89.60984215392254
Looks as if they did it for a bet.<eos>: 38.66553293449431
Heavy greasy
smell there always is in those works.<eos>: 138.81778432714825
Lukewarm glue in Thom’s next door
when I was there.

He took out his handkerchief to dab his nose.<eos>: 27.007909917155008
Citronlemon?<eos>: 5.454663312069258
Ah, the soap
I put there.<eos>: 28.047051131769383
Lose it out of that pocket.<eos>: 23.747502553480263
Putting back his handkerchief
he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket
of his trousers.

What perfume does your wife use?<eos>: 63.368731408845484
I could go home still: tram: something
I forgot.<eos>: 79.20627249616845

No.<eos>: 5.3673087592043816
Here.<eos>: 3.107997675956089
No.

A sudden screech of laughter came from the _Evening Telegraph_ office.
Know who that is.<eos>: 59.899058355439784
What’s up?<eos>: 8.499249051975335
Pop in a minute to phone.<eos>: 13.666223918130626
Ned Lambert it
is.

He entered softly.

ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA


—The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to
the dusty windowpane.

Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert’s quizzing
face, asked of it sourly:

—Agonising Christ, wouldn’t it give you a heartburn on your arse?

Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on:

—_Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on
its way, tho’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling
waters of Neptune’s blue domain, ’mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest
zephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or ’neath the shadows cast
o’er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the
forest_.<eos>: 46.741370472592415
What about that, Simon?<eos>: 17.159065597392583
he asked over the fringe of his
newspaper.<eos>: 19.871870919109984
How’s that for high?

—Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.

Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating:

—_The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage_.<eos>: 31.9556228779744
O boys!<eos>: 17.74639888742678
O boys!

—And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on
the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.

—That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window.<eos>: 34.13470923286978
I don’t want to
hear any more of the stuff.

He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and,
hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.

High falutin stuff.<eos>: 35.39623062008461
Bladderbags.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.
Rather upsets a man’s day, a funeral does.<eos>: 59.61834644927702
He has influence they say.
Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his

Alleluia.

—Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.

—What is it?<eos>: 12.865949897205368
Mr Bloom asked.

—A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered
with pomp of tone.<eos>: 33.2011993888999
_Our lovely land_.

SHORT BUT TO THE POINT


—Whose land?<eos>: 117.62083692517061
Mr Bloom said simply.

—Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews.<eos>: 22.933469493261747
With an
accent on the whose.

—Dan Dawson’s land Mr Dedalus said.

—Is it his speech last night?<eos>: 49.68121541561102
Mr Bloom asked.

Ned Lambert nodded.

—But listen to this, he said.

The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was
pushed in.

—Excuse me, J.<eos>: 29.77554312610269
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy said, entering.

Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside.

—I beg yours, he said.

—Good day, Jack.

—Come in.<eos>: 19.919131947115066
Come in.

—Good day.

—How are you, Dedalus?

—Well.<eos>: 20.871221154696375
And yourself?

J.<eos>: 27.05791136219831
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy shook his head.

SAD


Cleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be.<eos>: 40.02361279120241
Decline, poor chap.
That hectic flush spells finis for a man.<eos>: 33.09382369037511
Touch and go with him.<eos>: 12.83021550941506
What’s
in the wind, I wonder.<eos>: 13.899246597306005
Money worry.

—_Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks._

—You’re looking extra.

—Is the editor to be seen?<eos>: 50.123802229995526
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy asked, looking towards the
inner door.

—Very much so, professor MacHugh said.<eos>: 18.209286610687297
To be seen and heard.<eos>: 26.611536438838215
He’s in
his sanctum with Lenehan.

J.<eos>: 22.330006158526317
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the
pink pages of the file.

all blows over.<eos>: 45.97565851002921
Hail fellow well met the next moment.

—Ah, listen to this for God’ sake, Ned Lambert pleaded.<eos>: 41.05095486656724
_Or again if we
but climb the serried mountain peaks..._

—Bombast!<eos>: 66.3922104715185
the professor broke in testily.<eos>: 18.834812532078896
Enough of the inflated
windbag!

—_Peaks_, Ned Lambert went on, _towering high on high, to bathe our
souls, as it were..._

—Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said.<eos>: 27.953703079974463
Blessed and eternal God!<eos>: 50.277466826276445
Yes?<eos>: 5.0698603255667
Is he
taking anything for it?

_—As ’twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland’s portfolio,
unmatched, despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize
regions, for very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and
luscious pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent
translucent glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight..._

HIS NATIVE DORIC


—The moon, professor MacHugh said.<eos>: 55.12190790099662
He forgot Hamlet.

_—That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of
the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence..._

—O!<eos>: 58.131279679510634
Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan.<eos>: 17.452635569537318
Shite and
onions!<eos>: 21.79645706260939
That’ll do, Ned.<eos>: 18.694234781414764
Life is too short.

He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy
moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.

Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight.<eos>: 41.66674601538096
An
instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh’s
unshaven blackspectacled face.

—Doughy Daw!<eos>: 51.18534228674354
he cried.

WHAT WETHERUP SAID


All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot
cake that stuff.<eos>: 147.56269074441448
He was in the bakery line too, wasn’t he?<eos>: 20.803555512973347
Why they
call him Doughy Daw.<eos>: 13.687012073231
Feathered his nest well anyhow.<eos>: 71.97887240014188

Wetherup always said
that.<eos>: 41.38188932127955
Get a grip of them by the stomach.

The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested
by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in.<eos>: 49.5185969004537
The bold blue eyes stared
about them and the harsh voice asked:

—What is it?

—And here comes the sham squire himself!<eos>: 76.50575899477602
professor MacHugh said
grandly.

—Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue!<eos>: 30.344534113163313
the editor said in recognition.

—Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat.<eos>: 17.158504939255607
I must get a drink
after that.

—Drink!<eos>: 30.88774559326172
the editor cried.<eos>: 14.966745371940066
No drinks served before mass.

—Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out.<eos>: 64.01220250102543
Come on, Ned.

Ned Lambert sidled down from the table.<eos>: 26.469186688943854
The editor’s blue eyes roved
towards Mr Bloom’s face, shadowed by a smile.

—Will you join us, Myles?<eos>: 30.70955640793316
Ned Lambert asked.

MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED


—North Cork militia!<eos>: 71.83528348629092
the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece.<eos>: 19.801774614297337
We
won every time!<eos>: 61.087522321348196
North Cork and Spanish officers!

—Where was that, Myles?<eos>: 93.75337555419156
Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at
his toecaps.

—In Ohio!<eos>: 23.03906459939954
the editor shouted.

—So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.

Passing out he whispered to J.<eos>: 39.63095978502818
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy:

—Incipient jigs.<eos>: 20.095210429206084
Sad case.

—Ohio!<eos>: 13.811301293575747
the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.
My Ohio!

—A perfect cretic!<eos>: 75.35696672455022
the professor said.<eos>: 8.041368693393963
Long, short and long.

O, HARP EOLIAN!


He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking
off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant
unwashed teeth.

—Bingbang, bangbang.

Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.

—Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said.<eos>: 42.754240979378075
I just want to phone about an ad.

He went in.

—What about that leader this evening?<eos>: 49.602690851916584
professor MacHugh asked, coming
to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.

—That’ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly.<eos>: 33.11774316663799
Never you fret.
Hello, Jack.<eos>: 26.072502424986098
That’s all right.

—Good day, Myles, J.<eos>: 18.21881271543148
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip
limply back on the file.<eos>: 38.77747550796726
Is that Canada swindle case on today?

The telephone whirred inside.

—Twentyeight...<eos>: 95.81000911294859
No, twenty...<eos>: 47.35652170109973
Double four...<eos>: 32.52110450249743
Yes.

SPOT THE WINNER


Lenehan came out of the inner office with _Sport_’s tissues.

—Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup?<eos>: 41.43675713252168
he asked.<eos>: 5.051942343743682
Sceptre with O.
Madden up.

He tossed the tissues on to the table.

Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was
flung open.

—Hush, Lenehan said.<eos>: 69.46929485102272
I hear feetstoops.

Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin
by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the
steps.<eos>: 36.5395679764302
The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air
blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.

—It wasn’t me, sir.<eos>: 52.992925974741176
It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.

—Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said.<eos>: 35.67821921352479
There’s a hurricane
blowing.

Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he
stooped twice.

—Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said.<eos>: 45.26583778543192
It was Pat
Farrell shoved me, sir.

He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.

—Him, sir.

—Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.

He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.

J.<eos>: 46.43024247395095
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:

—Continued on page six, column four.

—Yes, _Evening Telegraph_ here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office.
Is the boss...?<eos>: 68.48926829743688
Yes, _Telegraph_...<eos>: 33.67782468697543
To where?<eos>: 13.538282871607286
Aha!<eos>: 5.101071619298531
Which auction
rooms?...<eos>: 273.8125981278675
Aha!<eos>: 5.101071619298531
I see...<eos>: 15.630218529291225
Right.<eos>: 12.300255453267342
I’ll catch him.

A COLLISION ENSUES


The bell whirred again as he rang off.<eos>: 38.27609246368555
He came in quickly and bumped
against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.

—_Pardon, monsieur_, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and
making a grimace.

—My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip.<eos>: 30.071230833589752
Are you hurt?<eos>: 16.350965026682182
I’m in a
hurry.

—Knee, Lenehan said.

He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:

—The accumulation of the _anno Domini_.

—Sorry, Mr Bloom said.

He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused.<eos>: 21.48335514081416
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy
slapped the heavy pages over.<eos>: 44.83061614512781
The noise of two shrill voices, a
mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on
the doorsteps:

     We are the boys of Wexford
     Who fought with heart and hand.

EXIT BLOOM


—I’m just running round to Bachelor’s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this
ad of Keyes’s.<eos>: 43.958023293415636
Want to fix it up.<eos>: 7.92308855637198
They tell me he’s round there in
Dillon’s.

He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces.<eos>: 29.047408668670315
The editor who,
leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand,
suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.

—Begone!<eos>: 43.81447352628946
he said.<eos>: 3.492439908750907
The world is before you.

—Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.

J.<eos>: 27.92142056074248
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan’s hand and read them,
blowing them apart gently, without comment.

—He’ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his
blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind.<eos>: 38.01380051998404
Look at the young scamps
after him.

—Show.<eos>: 26.70799588370462
Where?<eos>: 4.213136859000814
Lenehan cried, running to the window.

A STREET CORTÈGE


Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr
Bloom’s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a
tail of white bowknots.

—Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said,
and you’ll kick.<eos>: 43.72507484981183
O, my rib risible!<eos>: 7.030762585474056
Taking off his flat spaugs and the
walk.<eos>: 26.967146954521386
Small nines.<eos>: 4.139898432801054
Steal upon larks.

He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding
feet past the fireplace to J.<eos>: 49.78354288453755
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy who placed the tissues in his
receiving hands.

—What’s that?<eos>: 16.085716273358365
Myles Crawford said with a start.<eos>: 14.42278137891944
Where are the other two
gone?

—Who?<eos>: 36.56010049151165
the professor said, turning.<eos>: 16.81386723809312
They’re gone round to the Oval for a
drink.<eos>: 33.993599984297745
Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall.<eos>: 70.63318797526219
Came over last night.

—Come on then, Myles Crawford said.<eos>: 21.01918824559828
Where’s my hat?

He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his
jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket.<eos>: 48.43519290686644
They jingled then in the
air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.

—He’s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.

—Seems to be, J.<eos>: 52.340856227481105
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in
murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems.<eos>: 24.38589441493975
Who has the
most matches?

THE CALUMET OF PEACE


He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself.<eos>: 63.82675779458921
Lenehan
promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn.<eos>: 74.17201684941034
J.
J.<eos>: 6.20323751027041
O’Molloy opened his case again and offered it.

—_Thanky vous_, Lenehan said, helping himself.

The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow.<eos>: 30.526671367641388
He
declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:

     ’Twas rank and fame that tempted thee,
     ’Twas empire charmed thy heart.

The professor grinned, locking his long lips.

—Eh?<eos>: 59.20609141867581
You bloody old Roman empire?<eos>: 45.65395722688708
Myles Crawford said.

He took a cigarette from the open case.<eos>: 22.089586429256098
Lenehan, lighting it for him
with quick grace, said:

—Silence for my brandnew riddle!

—_Imperium romanum_, J.<eos>: 39.00507044425894
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy said gently.<eos>: 7.574197246145562
It sounds nobler than
British or Brixton.<eos>: 47.68206631143314
The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.

Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.

—That’s it, he said.<eos>: 36.05090293067615
We are the fat.<eos>: 19.759588019772828
You and I are the fat in the fire.
We haven’t got the chance of a snowball in hell.

THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME


—Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws.<eos>: 47.34182488914027
We
mustn’t be led away by words, by sounds of words.<eos>: 60.58777646345667
We think of Rome,
imperial, imperious, imperative.

He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:

—What was their civilisation?<eos>: 21.785808548598585
Vast, I allow: but vile.<eos>: 57.81527972455333
Cloacae: sewers.
The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: _It is meet to
be here.<eos>: 38.78559600586547
Let us build an altar to Jehovah_.<eos>: 33.76353645881416
The Roman, like the
Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on
which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal
obsession.<eos>: 101.06214059301338
He gazed about him in his toga and he said: _It is meet to
be here.<eos>: 23.340504173991583
Let us construct a watercloset._

—Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said.<eos>: 26.9472312456006
Our old ancient
ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness’s, were partial
to the running stream.

—They were nature’s gentlemen, J.<eos>: 45.775026539828424
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy murmured.<eos>: 9.99106083930032
But we have
also Roman law.

—And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.

—Do you know that story about chief baron Palles?<eos>: 47.68323249226752
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy asked.
It was at the royal university dinner.<eos>: 39.090346231436456
Everything was going swimmingly
...

—First my riddle, Lenehan said.<eos>: 28.3188682408808
Are you ready?

Mr O’Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from
the hallway.<eos>: 35.15176785192372
Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.

—_Entrez, mes enfants!_ Lenehan cried.

—I escort a suppliant, Mr O’Madden Burke said melodiously.<eos>: 14.346050516500684
Youth led by
Experience visits Notoriety.

—How do you do?<eos>: 30.690442448470186
the editor said, holding out a hand.<eos>: 28.879369151934895
Come in.<eos>: 8.737213119598103
Your
governor is just gone.

???


Lenehan said to all:

—Silence!<eos>: 47.977773456014525
What opera resembles a railwayline?<eos>: 19.92317618751737
Reflect, ponder,
excogitate, reply.

Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and
signature.

—Who?<eos>: 29.047148410841725
the editor asked.

Bit torn off.

—Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.

—That old pelters, the editor said.<eos>: 26.753976083193795
Who tore it?<eos>: 20.004056112040704
Was he short taken?

     On swift sail flaming
     From storm and south
     He comes, pale vampire,
     Mouth to my mouth.

—Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their
shoulders.<eos>: 90.2529169346866
Foot and mouth?<eos>: 31.402179107000034
Are you turned...?

Bullockbefriending bard.

SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT


—Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing.<eos>: 51.46106071159839
The letter is not mine.<eos>: 32.34817909179612
Mr
Garrett Deasy asked me to...

—O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too.<eos>: 21.38867272711407
The
bloodiest old tartar God ever made.<eos>: 48.82175263971092
By Jesus, she had the foot and
mouth disease and no mistake!<eos>: 61.31007754544274
The night she threw the soup in the
waiter’s face in the Star and Garter.<eos>: 49.339494071632096
Oho!

A woman brought sin into the world.<eos>: 45.6395746574878
For Helen, the runaway wife of
Menelaus, ten years the Greeks.<eos>: 33.078782109868946
O’Rourke, prince of Breffni.

—Is he a widower?<eos>: 19.70596903114459
Stephen asked.

—Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the
typescript.<eos>: 27.591413595799764
Emperor’s horses.<eos>: 17.711093677841582
Habsburg.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
An Irishman saved his life on
the ramparts of Vienna.<eos>: 30.938882624031237
Don’t you forget!<eos>: 10.413139929938465
Maximilian Karl O’Donnell,
graf von Tirconnell in Ireland.<eos>: 20.260364275036263
Sent his heir over to make the king an
Austrian fieldmarshal now.<eos>: 69.66748046090417
Going to be trouble there one day.<eos>: 30.87113639726501
Wild
geese.<eos>: 19.339187295587887
O yes, every time.<eos>: 22.234928469008484
Don’t you forget that!

—The moot point is did he forget it, J.<eos>: 32.31734070251268
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy said quietly,
turning a horseshoe paperweight.<eos>: 8.639484388454456
Saving princes is a thank you job.

Professor MacHugh turned on him.

—And if not?<eos>: 51.00815983464527
he said.

—I’ll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began.<eos>: 12.64491328264436
A Hungarian it was one
day...

LOST CAUSES NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED


—We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said.<eos>: 167.72165614154298
Success for
us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination.<eos>: 34.24792735758734
We were never
loyal to the successful.<eos>: 52.02701761005856
We serve them.<eos>: 18.459733865189104
I teach the blatant Latin
language.<eos>: 51.373635900037286
I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is
the maxim: time is money.<eos>: 53.731159043934845
Material domination.<eos>: 2.842387380473868
_Dominus!_ Lord!<eos>: 32.95288722634937
Where
is the spirituality?<eos>: 6.638957219024777
Lord Jesus?<eos>: 18.968903845304478
Lord Salisbury?<eos>: 6.20393007526044
A sofa in a westend
club.<eos>: 32.351548625039385
But the Greek!

KYRIE ELEISON!


A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long
lips.

—The Greek!<eos>: 26.20080924319447
he said again.<eos>: 7.81506853747732
_Kyrios!_ Shining word!<eos>: 70.91412007642944
The vowels the
Semite and the Saxon know not.<eos>: 30.56820486643059
_Kyrie!_ The radiance of the intellect.
I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind.<eos>: 24.619077019027106
_Kyrie eleison!_
The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit.
We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered
at Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an _imperium,_ that
went under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami.<eos>: 38.772049072592516
Yes, yes.<eos>: 5.039062816379896
They went
under.<eos>: 28.958522946501898
Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve
the fortunes of Greece.<eos>: 30.29312595901252
Loyal to a lost cause.

He strode away from them towards the window.

—They went forth to battle, Mr O’Madden Burke said greyly, but they
always fell.

—Boohoo!<eos>: 38.26283808839626
Lenehan wept with a little noise.<eos>: 56.20003123160896
Owing to a brick received in
the latter half of the _matinée_.<eos>: 26.70242163532756
Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus!

He whispered then near Stephen’s ear:

LENEHAN’S LIMERICK


—_There’s a ponderous pundit MacHugh
Who wears goggles of ebony hue.
As he mostly sees double
To wear them why trouble?
I can’t see the Joe Miller.<eos>: 89.72960994867935
Can you?_


In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says.<eos>: 81.46006382189611
Whose mother is beastly dead.

Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.

—That’ll be all right, he said.<eos>: 21.38176443476693
I’ll read the rest after.<eos>: 19.56095183594555
That’ll be
all right.

Lenehan extended his hands in protest.

—But my riddle!<eos>: 32.03020902819021
he said.<eos>: 3.492439908750907
What opera is like a railwayline?

—Opera?<eos>: 27.943934176843637
Mr O’Madden Burke’s sphinx face reriddled.

Lenehan announced gladly:

—_The Rose of Castile_.<eos>: 18.953688317788266
See the wheeze?<eos>: 8.977145246947343
Rows of cast steel.<eos>: 34.67531800609598
Gee!

He poked Mr O’Madden Burke mildly in the spleen.<eos>: 12.37222299760594
Mr O’Madden Burke fell
back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.

—Help!<eos>: 27.011486356023696
he sighed.<eos>: 11.86615831674982
I feel a strong weakness.

Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling
tissues.

The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across
Stephen’s and Mr O’Madden Burke’s loose ties.

—Paris, past and present, he said.<eos>: 47.81136955946834
You look like communards.

—Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J.<eos>: 45.99591144936172
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy said in
quiet mockery.<eos>: 22.510404941884023
Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland
between you?<eos>: 73.4864589337572
You look as though you had done the deed.<eos>: 49.992229093123136
General
Bobrikoff.

OMNIUM GATHERUM


—We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.

—All the talents, Myles Crawford said.<eos>: 13.630147333116215
Law, the classics...

—The turf, Lenehan put in.

—Literature, the press.

—If Bloom were here, the professor said.<eos>: 34.7487254662893
The gentle art of
advertisement.

—And Madam Bloom, Mr O’Madden Burke added.<eos>: 30.34986076184655
The vocal muse.<eos>: 3.6625638733054102
Dublin’s
prime favourite.

Lenehan gave a loud cough.

—Ahem!<eos>: 46.4019377023511
he said very softly.<eos>: 37.021214893794166
O, for a fresh of breath air!<eos>: 97.57201540968062
I caught a
cold in the park.<eos>: 29.629165263439173
The gate was open.

“YOU CAN DO IT!”


The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen’s shoulder.

—I want you to write something for me, he said.<eos>: 29.912469300269073
Something with a bite
in it.<eos>: 21.189167253783232
You can do it.<eos>: 8.363385420147209
I see it in your face.<eos>: 14.060110561582437
_In the lexicon of
youth_...

See it in your face.<eos>: 26.466583599601464
See it in your eye.<eos>: 13.297537153051397
Lazy idle little schemer.

—Foot and mouth disease!<eos>: 58.27734138817139
the editor cried in scornful invective.<eos>: 16.327550436620843
Great
nationalist meeting in Borris-in-Ossory.<eos>: 27.1842650196699
All balls!<eos>: 6.814178894086325
Bulldosing the
public!<eos>: 34.292903262134224
Give them something with a bite in it.<eos>: 23.660696775183595
Put us all into it, damn
its soul.<eos>: 59.38127334124039
Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M’Carthy.

—We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O’Madden Burke said.

Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.

—He wants you for the pressgang, J.<eos>: 30.5487745501288
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy said.

THE GREAT GALLAHER


—You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in
emphasis.<eos>: 22.792339308336143
Wait a minute.<eos>: 12.312041583989025
We’ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher
used to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the
Clarence.<eos>: 24.12408033121924
Gallaher, that was a pressman for you.<eos>: 11.692275594333388
That was a pen.<eos>: 17.701412372132943
You
know how he made his mark?<eos>: 40.72236135863543
I’ll tell you.<eos>: 3.8735536129283528
That was the smartest piece
of journalism ever known.<eos>: 32.14638151139503
That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of
the invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I
suppose.<eos>: 36.115145166386526
I’ll show you.

He pushed past them to the files.

—Look at here, he said turning.<eos>: 27.14390580105632
The _New York World_ cabled for a
special.<eos>: 30.497089250806408
Remember that time?

Professor MacHugh nodded.

—_New York World_, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw
hat.<eos>: 38.26760843334461
Where it took place.<eos>: 52.911562605327376
Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean.<eos>: 89.28353126141052
Joe Brady and
the rest of them.<eos>: 25.84744293459475
Where Skin-the-Goat drove the car.<eos>: 54.058143532682294
Whole route, see?

—Skin-the-Goat, Mr O’Madden Burke said.<eos>: 29.56503496720077
Fitzharris.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
He has that
cabman’s shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge.<eos>: 51.58822859663904
Holohan told me.
You know Holohan?

—Hop and carry one, is it?<eos>: 54.792580613509244
Myles Crawford said.

—And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for
the corporation.<eos>: 36.787220945596445
A night watchman.

Stephen turned in surprise.

—Gumley?<eos>: 50.19834340838642
he said.<eos>: 3.492439908750907
You don’t say so?<eos>: 9.92603199207894
A friend of my father’s, is it?

—Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily.<eos>: 31.31569840982557
Let Gumley mind the
stones, see they don’t run away.<eos>: 52.525485899826215
Look at here.<eos>: 13.166292806638529
What did Ignatius
Gallaher do?<eos>: 63.212768217728545
I’ll tell you.<eos>: 3.8735536129283528
Inspiration of genius.<eos>: 14.818902878567144
Cabled right away.
Have you _Weekly Freeman_ of 17 March?<eos>: 113.882457637891
Right.<eos>: 12.300255453267342
Have you got that?

He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.

—Take page four, advertisement for Bransome’s coffee, let us say.<eos>: 60.47232931406987
Have
you got that?<eos>: 14.456854258223872
Right.

The telephone whirred.

A DISTANT VOICE


—I’ll answer it, the professor said, going.

—B is parkgate.<eos>: 37.29882321684642
Good.

His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.

—T is viceregal lodge.<eos>: 117.9127483358518
C is where murder took place.<eos>: 233.48025727716308
K is Knockmaroon
gate.

The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock’s wattles.<eos>: 49.456572494922106
An illstarched
dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his
waistcoat.

—Hello?<eos>: 38.059131799799275
_Evening Telegraph_ here...<eos>: 50.499580375738226
Hello?...<eos>: 14.238658837530846
Who’s there?...<eos>: 13.485729853531055
Yes...
Yes...<eos>: 30.762013284340373
Yes.

—F to P is the route Skin-the-Goat drove the car for an alibi,
Inchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh.<eos>: 51.18430340491165
F.A.B.P.
Got that?<eos>: 51.25928443192685
X is Davy’s publichouse in upper Leeson street.

The professor came to the inner door.

—Bloom is at the telephone, he said.

—Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly.<eos>: 29.282811027032658
X is Davy’s
publichouse, see?

CLEVER, VERY


—Clever, Lenehan said.<eos>: 65.88379525596147
Very.

—Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody
history.

Nightmare from which you will never awake.

—I saw it, the editor said proudly.<eos>: 45.50842260946162
I was present.<eos>: 16.21628659785679
Dick Adams, the
besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and
myself.

Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing:

—Madam, I’m Adam.<eos>: 54.22421359017829
And Able was I ere I saw Elba.

—History!<eos>: 70.8879302052312
Myles Crawford cried.<eos>: 7.652061218554842
The Old Woman of Prince’s street was
there first.<eos>: 46.414279681802704
There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that.<eos>: 60.66149451933743
Out of
an advertisement.<eos>: 16.300553888038184
Gregor Grey made the design for it.<eos>: 52.710133432186105
That gave him the
leg up.<eos>: 32.127101230385094
Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the _Star._
Now he’s got in with Blumenfeld.<eos>: 49.59681890911833
That’s press.<eos>: 7.830357091331656
That’s talent.<eos>: 3.261406647777291
Pyatt!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
He
was all their daddies!

—The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the
brother-in-law of Chris Callinan.

—Hello?...<eos>: 40.0943256515431
Are you there?...<eos>: 24.555450303526595
Yes, he’s here still.<eos>: 15.251176305423703
Come across
yourself.

—Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh?<eos>: 26.878782619393267
the editor cried.

He flung the pages down.

—Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O’Madden Burke.

—Very smart, Mr O’Madden Burke said.

Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.

—Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers
were up before the recorder...

—O yes, J.<eos>: 25.076728090760998
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy said eagerly.<eos>: 6.032094789927879
Lady Dudley was walking home
through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that
cyclone last year and thought she’d buy a view of Dublin.<eos>: 64.26763425321174
And it turned
out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or
Skin-the-Goat.<eos>: 75.52266958696094
Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine!

—They’re only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.
Psha!<eos>: 53.458272906950555
Press and the bar!<eos>: 24.7460885275809
Where have you a man now at the bar like those
fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O’Hagan.
Eh?<eos>: 52.06566122332683
Ah, bloody nonsense.<eos>: 10.731061082837236
Psha!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
Only in the halfpenny place.

His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.

Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss?<eos>: 64.50332875476369
How do you know?<eos>: 10.352479672985577
Why did you
write it then?

RHYMES AND REASONS

He saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, in
russet, entwining, _per l’aer perso_, in mauve, in purple, _quella
pacifica oriafiamma_, gold of oriflamme, _di rimirar fè più ardenti._
But I old men, penitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth

—Speak up for yourself, Mr O’Madden Burke said.

SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY...

J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.

—My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false
construction on my words.<eos>: 31.159618890507613
I hold no brief, as at present advised, for
the third profession _qua_ profession but your Cork legs are running
away with you.<eos>: 154.31200017043764

face.<eos>: 74.09052667863072

Psha!

—Well, J.<eos>: 13.44615340291443
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy said, Bushe K.C., for example.

—Bushe?<eos>: 38.3314430813943
the editor said.<eos>: 10.961832641641315
Well, yes: Bushe, yes.<eos>: 18.713833485658515
He has a strain of it
in his blood.<eos>: 27.423901080623576
Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.

—He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for
....<eos>: 72.61311205442914
But no matter.

J.<eos>: 27.41982297098557
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly:

—One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life
fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe.<eos>: 88.76911865383953
It was in that case of fratricide,
the Childs murder case.<eos>: 39.013762797529715
Bushe defended him.

     _And in the porches of mine ear did pour._

By the way how did he find that out?<eos>: 67.65800100001186
He died in his sleep.<eos>: 18.420072685406648
Or the other
story, beast with two backs?

—What was that?<eos>: 31.003106544250105
the professor asked.

ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM


—He spoke on the law of evidence, J.<eos>: 28.5419445912054
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy said, of Roman justice
as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the _lex talionis_.<eos>: 19.570713976843518
And he
cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.

—Ha.

—A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced.<eos>: 22.372464330838223
Silence!

Pause.<eos>: 19.86810944350954
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy took out his cigarettecase.

False lull.<eos>: 24.625084800369386
Something quite ordinary.

Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.

I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that
it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match,
that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.

A POLISHED PERIOD


J.<eos>: 155.4565535557602
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy resumed, moulding his words:

—He said of it: _that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and
terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and
of prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of
sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of
soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to live._

His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.

—Fine!<eos>: 69.4002078842196
Myles Crawford said at once.

—The divine afflatus, Mr O’Madden Burke said.

—You like it?<eos>: 12.588393931555613
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy asked Stephen.

Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed.<eos>: 47.43419118499796
He
took a cigarette from the case.<eos>: 18.65602364439164
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy offered his case to
Myles Crawford.<eos>: 32.519256370253814
Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his
trophy, saying:

—Muchibus thankibus.

A MAN OF HIGH MORALE


—Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J.<eos>: 52.824854339053495
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy said
to Stephen.<eos>: 7.478989925227429
What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal
hush poets: A.<eos>: 84.9439089328714
E.<eos>: 1.5381861561152315
the mastermystic?<eos>: 5.3288389064763955
That Blavatsky woman started it.
She was a nice old bag of tricks.<eos>: 34.753389087746285
A.<eos>: 10.782071472302787
E.<eos>: 1.5381861561152315
has been telling some yankee
interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to
ask him about planes of consciousness.<eos>: 42.43476624827933
Magennis thinks you must have
been pulling A.<eos>: 83.16826309234567
E.’s leg.<eos>: 29.155008085167875
He is a man of the very highest morale,
Magennis.

Speaking about me.<eos>: 27.153977734571164
What did he say?<eos>: 9.5293528505016
What did he say?<eos>: 9.5293528505016
What did he say
about me?<eos>: 14.3726663758562
Don’t ask.

—No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.
Wait a moment.<eos>: 23.02618061919797
Let me say one thing.<eos>: 29.54262941593428
The finest display of oratory I
ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical
society.<eos>: 151.32189843919826
Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had
spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days),
advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.

He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:

—You know Gerald Fitzgibbon.<eos>: 87.49063701981711
Then you can imagine the style of his
discourse.

—He is sitting with Tim Healy, J.<eos>: 22.143815522989907
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy said, rumour has it, on
the Trinity college estates commission.

—He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child’s
frock.<eos>: 35.15158106400381
Go on.<eos>: 6.418660672204761
Well?

—It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator,
full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will
not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely
upon the new movement.<eos>: 39.949347023916054
It was then a new movement.<eos>: 28.93122295545164
We were weak,
therefore worthless.

He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an
outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and
ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new
focus.

IMPROMPTU


In ferial tone he addressed J.<eos>: 75.47956897530774
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy:

—Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed.<eos>: 40.19733501781303
That he had
prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one
shorthandwriter in the hall.<eos>: 53.07047884988197
His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy
beard round it.<eos>: 61.72597806178835
He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he
looked (though he was not) a dying man.

His gaze turned at once but slowly from J.<eos>: 93.65616706068714
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy’s towards
Stephen’s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking.<eos>: 29.15578293198446
His
unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his
withering hair.<eos>: 105.53657942065324
Still seeking, he said:

—When Fitzgibbon’s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.
Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.

He raised his head firmly.<eos>: 77.6414333814941
His eyes bethought themselves once more.
Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.

He began:

_—Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in
listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment
since by my learned friend.<eos>: 90.5596319002091
It seemed to me that I had been transported
into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this
age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the
speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful
Moses._

His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes
ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech.<eos>: 86.07674619841751
_And let our
crooked smokes._ Noble words coming.<eos>: 121.73632939958834
Look out.<eos>: 7.375113176073131
Could you try your hand
at it yourself?

_—And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian
highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride.<eos>: 58.977734108871445
I heard
his words and their meaning was revealed to me._

FROM THE FATHERS


It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are
corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they
were good could be corrupted.<eos>: 104.45935302537235
Ah, curse you!<eos>: 21.78624486085519
That’s saint Augustine.

_—Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our
language?<eos>: 54.57549827350176
You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people.
You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and
our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise
furrow the waters of the known globe.<eos>: 53.955266129233664
You have but emerged from
primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong
history and a polity._

Nile.

Child, man, effigy.

By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple
in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.

_—You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and
mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra.
Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas.<eos>: 48.49314242694924
Israel is
weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her
arms.<eos>: 251.25773481485365
Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at
our name._

A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech.<eos>: 45.57624660308463
He lifted his voice above it
boldly:

_—But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and
accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will
and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never
have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor
followed the pillar of the cloud by day.<eos>: 107.7637298700878
He would never have spoken
with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai’s mountaintop nor ever have
come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and
bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of
the outlaw._

He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.

OMINOUS—FOR HIM!


J.<eos>: 46.250124579707766
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy said not without regret:

—And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.

—A—sudden—at—the—moment—though—from—lingering—illness—often—previously—
expectorated—demise, Lenehan added.<eos>: 148.16965817300618
And with a great future behind him.

The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and
pattering up the staircase.

—That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted.

Gone with the wind.<eos>: 36.78935412398649
Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings.<eos>: 35.6978642233857

The tribune’s words, howled and scattered to the

A people sheltered within his voice.<eos>: 36.86915171648958
Dead noise.<eos>: 11.427419257083022
Akasic

Love and laud him: me
no more.

I have money.

—Gentlemen, Stephen said.<eos>: 34.75265652243184
As the next motion on the agenda paper may I
suggest that the house do now adjourn?

—You take my breath away.<eos>: 107.38223274219854
It is not perchance a French compliment?<eos>: 24.609251681953886
Mr
O’Madden Burke asked.<eos>: 4.909455425276344
’Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug,
metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.

—That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved.<eos>: 41.94449022836493
All that are in favour
say ay, Lenehan announced.<eos>: 136.41409978937807
The contrary no.<eos>: 38.75967084284344
I declare it carried.<eos>: 54.87135535118938
To
which particular boosing shed...?<eos>: 177.2177977531921
My casting vote is: Mooney’s!

He led the way, admonishing:

—We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not?<eos>: 63.612892464787464
Yes,
we will not.<eos>: 12.24033311035353
By no manner of means.

Mr O’Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally’s lunge of his
umbrella:

—Lay on, Macduff!

—Chip of the old block!<eos>: 34.85076274263183
the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the
shoulder.<eos>: 39.38832174913015
Let us go.<eos>: 17.294648354651525
Where are those blasted keys?

He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.

—Foot and mouth.<eos>: 49.61890573022966
I know.<eos>: 6.268577991865942
That’ll be all right.<eos>: 8.615115608456374
That’ll go in.<eos>: 12.090946883408991
Where are
they?<eos>: 12.386978662373075
That’s all right.

He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.

LET US HOPE


J.<eos>: 30.028283573464837
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen:

—I hope you will live to see it published.<eos>: 35.44344813793517
Myles, one moment.

He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.

—Come along, Stephen, the professor said.<eos>: 23.099943272418116
That is fine, isn’t it?<eos>: 18.14173402990844
It
has the prophetic vision.<eos>: 24.152759802920585
_Fuit Ilium!_ The sack of windy Troy.
Kingdoms of this world.<eos>: 29.92264105796777
The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen
today.

The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and
rushed out into the street, yelling:

—Racing special!

Dublin.<eos>: 53.24496392287188
I have much, much to learn.

They turned to the left along Abbey street.

—I have a vision too, Stephen said.

—Yes?<eos>: 29.699750980907986
the professor said, skipping to get into step.<eos>: 33.076418892083844
Crawford will
follow.

Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran:

—Racing special!

DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN


Dubliners.

—Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty
and fiftythree years in Fumbally’s lane.

—Where is that?<eos>: 70.12264456822265
the professor asked.

—Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.

Damp night reeking of hungry dough.<eos>: 33.28970851558353
Against the wall.<eos>: 5.938344763394737
Face glistering
tallow under her fustian shawl.<eos>: 13.75631077197646
Frantic hearts.<eos>: 16.092744731982183
Akasic records.
Quicker, darlint!

On now.<eos>: 19.18010091470882
Dare it.<eos>: 5.076781405849564
Let there be life.

—They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson’s pillar.
They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox.<eos>: 40.228360925158626
They
shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies
with the blade of a knife.<eos>: 47.75778504823748
Two and three in silver and one and seven in
coppers.<eos>: 65.90753769906873
They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their
umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.

—Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.

LIFE ON THE RAW


—They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at
the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate
Collins, proprietress...<eos>: 68.2080387708575
They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from
a girl at the foot of Nelson’s pillar to take off the thirst of the
brawn.<eos>: 72.04797407494372
They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile
and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting,
encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the
other have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin,
threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits.<eos>: 59.853125298261226
Glory be to God.
They had no idea it was that high.

Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe.<eos>: 71.09707608884865
Anne Kearns has the
lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who
got a bottleful from a passionist father.<eos>: 42.77240144960153
Florence MacCabe takes a
crubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.

—Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice.<eos>: 75.52035774732659
Vestal virgins.<eos>: 20.874500100599814
I can
see them.<eos>: 12.428874971222369
What’s keeping our friend?

He turned.

A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all
directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering.<eos>: 32.21087543265653
Hard after them
Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet
face, talking with J.<eos>: 111.05498276403948
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy.

—Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.

He set off again to walk by Stephen’s side.

RETURN OF BLOOM


—Yes, he said.<eos>: 31.659695177823274
I see them.

Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the
offices of the _Irish Catholic_ and _Dublin Penny Journal_, called:

—Mr Crawford!<eos>: 48.08394609791947
A moment!

—_Telegraph_!<eos>: 38.337656212909145
Racing special!

—What is it?<eos>: 17.59060378136708
Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.

A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom’s face:

—Terrible tragedy in Rathmines!<eos>: 46.65838555621433
A child bit by a bellows!

INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR


—Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps,
puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket.<eos>: 53.722821947036
I spoke with Mr Keyes
just now.<eos>: 72.39127945036353
He’ll give a renewal for two months, he says.<eos>: 36.07696103354837
After he’ll
see.<eos>: 13.655609476868735
But he wants a par to call attention in the _Telegraph_ too, the
Saturday pink.<eos>: 69.06191847288558
And he wants it copied if it’s not too late I told
councillor Nannetti from the _Kilkenny People_.<eos>: 70.83648852659607
I can have access to it
in the national library.<eos>: 29.797008053887783
House of keys, don’t you see?<eos>: 13.705051300743518
His name is
Keyes.<eos>: 24.933255078532607
It’s a play on the name.<eos>: 15.152924218253773
But he practically promised he’d give
the renewal.<eos>: 50.92781878365254
But he wants just a little puff.<eos>: 35.68564721192601
What will I tell him, Mr
Crawford?

K.M.A.


—Will you tell him he can kiss my arse?<eos>: 45.07760290206812
Myles Crawford said throwing
out his arm for emphasis.<eos>: 31.91121351600831
Tell him that straight from the stable.

A bit nervy.<eos>: 33.083701204101885
Look out for squalls.<eos>: 13.99677528482858
All off for a drink.<eos>: 26.58470651837883
Arm in arm.
Lenehan’s yachting cap on the cadge beyond.<eos>: 36.77916957026276
Usual blarney.<eos>: 2.752422467619225
Wonder is
that young Dedalus the moving spirit.<eos>: 167.96363402532532
Has a good pair of boots on him
today.<eos>: 44.26999106803525
Last time I saw him he had his heels on view.<eos>: 41.34783556615983
Been walking in
muck somewhere.<eos>: 18.884473015179694
Careless chap.<eos>: 24.145634751561932
What was he doing in Irishtown?

—Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I
suppose it’s worth a short par.<eos>: 28.164357857379308
He’d give the ad, I think.<eos>: 16.297242873330717
I’ll tell
him...

K.M.R.I.A.


—He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his
shoulder.<eos>: 49.33337851175572
Any time he likes, tell him.

While Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode on
jerkily.

RAISING THE WIND


—_Nulla bona_, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin.<eos>: 52.682875895527104
I’m up to
here.<eos>: 16.54605236499776
I’ve been through the hoop myself.<eos>: 22.25718814277378
I was looking for a fellow to
back a bill for me no later than last week.<eos>: 69.25181128773687
Sorry, Jack.<eos>: 12.276258084457528
You must take
the will for the deed.<eos>: 39.16367251788616
With a heart and a half if I could raise the
wind anyhow.

J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently.<eos>: 33.420946917843885
They caught
up on the others and walked abreast.

—When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty
fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the
railings.

—Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford.<eos>: 66.93633215950781
Two old
Dublin women on the top of Nelson’s pillar.

SOME COLUMN!—THAT’S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID


—That’s new, Myles Crawford said.<eos>: 41.44484683518092
That’s copy.<eos>: 9.273725344230394
Out for the waxies’
Dargle.<eos>: 10.016777887225883
Two old trickies, what?

—But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on.<eos>: 59.24272385351066
They see
the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines’
blue dome, Adam and Eve’s, saint Laurence O’Toole’s.<eos>: 33.539527683459724
But it makes them
giddy to look so they pull up their skirts...

THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES


—Easy all, Myles Crawford said.<eos>: 115.97623057263411
No poetic licence.<eos>: 16.057859001479333
We’re in the
archdiocese here.

—And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue
of the onehandled adulterer.

—Onehandled adulterer!<eos>: 29.10632586643586
the professor cried.<eos>: 11.736605928091574
I like that.<eos>: 11.98858108331476
I see the
idea.<eos>: 14.05508135810889
I see what you mean.

DAMES DONATE DUBLIN’S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF


—It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too
tired to look up or down or to speak.<eos>: 50.61981114942439
They put the bag of plums between
them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with
their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and
spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.

He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close.<eos>: 93.20844827781447
Lenehan and Mr O’Madden
Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney’s.

—Finished?<eos>: 43.60609954030854
Myles Crawford said.<eos>: 4.977280091358305
So long as they do no worse.

—You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of
Gorgias, the sophist.<eos>: 17.918584707943246
It is said of him that none could tell if he were
bitterer against others or against himself.<eos>: 111.68474996813126
He was the son of a noble
and a bondwoman.<eos>: 19.833164877222696
And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of
beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.

Poor Penelope.<eos>: 67.22793824858066
Penelope Rich.

They made ready to cross O’Connell street.

HELLO THERE, CENTRAL!


At various points along the eight lines tramcars with motionless
trolleys stood in their tracks, bound for or from Rathmines,
Rathfarnham, Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Sandymount Green,
Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Donnybrook, Palmerston Park and Upper
Rathmines, all still, becalmed in short circuit.<eos>: 79.05866225165634
Hackney cars, cabs,
delivery waggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water
floats with rattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedrawn,
rapidly.

WHAT?—AND LIKEWISE—WHERE?


—But what do you call it?<eos>: 28.37898762336641
Myles Crawford asked.<eos>: 6.76766229380647
Where did they get the
plums?

VIRGILIAN, SAYS PEDAGOGUE.<eos>: 21.602210509166316
SOPHOMORE PLUMPS FOR OLD MAN MOSES.


—Call it, wait, the professor said, opening his long lips wide to
reflect.<eos>: 55.636170902549615
Call it, let me see.<eos>: 12.483116830803722
Call it: _deus nobis hæc otia fecit._

—No, Stephen said.<eos>: 7.643344298273105
I call it _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The
Parable of The Plums._

—I see, the professor said.

He laughed richly.

—I see, he said again with new pleasure.<eos>: 31.20056235467085
Moses and the promised land.
We gave him that idea, he added to J.<eos>: 57.64746021852304

O’Molloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue and held
his peace.

—I see, the professor said.

He halted on sir John Gray’s pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson
through the meshes of his wry smile.

—Onehandled adulterer, he said smiling grimly.<eos>: 32.22503275868652
That tickles me, I must
say.

—Tickled the old ones too, Myles Crawford said, if the God Almighty’s
truth was known.

 —Two apples a penny!<eos>: 69.76982024343083
Two for a penny!

His gaze passed over the glazed apples serried on her stand.
Australians they must be this time of year.<eos>: 53.82811635100993
Shiny peels: polishes them
up with a rag or a handkerchief.

Wait.<eos>: 53.181782387346466
Those poor birds.

He halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes
for a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down
into the Liffey.<eos>: 63.92690264327796
See that?<eos>: 9.361614303759923
The gulls swooped silently, two, then all
from their heights, pouncing on prey.<eos>: 54.9591470291147

No, no.

singing into a barrel.<eos>: 77.27376388294084
Now, isn’t that wit.<eos>: 18.518551535627708
They used to call him big
Ben.<eos>: 42.73252662931187
Not half as witty as calling him base barreltone.<eos>: 97.76153875563489

That was the night...

—O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?

—O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?

—No use complaining.<eos>: 21.32465484855226
How is Molly those times?<eos>: 53.28603133161448
Haven’t seen her for
ages.

—In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily.<eos>: 21.533213705911674
Milly has a position down in
Mullingar, you know.

—Go away!<eos>: 65.44424944917118
Isn’t that grand for her?

—Yes.<eos>: 21.021255117658946
In a photographer’s there.<eos>: 9.757574316160245
Getting on like a house on fire.<eos>: 37.82228739954017
How
are all your charges?

—All on the baker’s list, Mrs Breen said.

How many has she?<eos>: 28.636723751753472
No other in sight.

—You’re in black, I see.<eos>: 28.18565990791907
You have no...

—No, Mr Bloom said.<eos>: 9.779975860457107
I have just come from a funeral.

Going to crop up all day, I foresee.<eos>: 44.95787548150898
Who’s dead, when and what did he
die of?<eos>: 34.11038722476111
Turn up like a bad penny.

—O, dear me, Mrs Breen said.<eos>: 26.68833247030088
I hope it wasn’t any near relation.

May as well get her sympathy.

—Dignam, Mr Bloom said.<eos>: 66.59075981577801
An old friend of mine.<eos>: 18.23643788999899
He died quite suddenly,
poor fellow.<eos>: 48.7258917808845
Heart trouble, I believe.<eos>: 15.463169229781677
Funeral was this morning.

     Your funeral’s tomorrow
     While you’re coming through the rye.
     Diddlediddle dumdum
     Diddlediddle...

—Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen’s womaneyes said melancholily.

Now that’s quite enough about that.<eos>: 41.856939464722934
Just: quietly: husband.

—And your lord and master?

Mrs Breen turned up her two large eyes.<eos>: 79.02330493453569
Hasn’t lost them anyhow.

—O, don’t be talking!<eos>: 16.944723771917364
she said.<eos>: 3.4612706779243974
He’s a caution to rattlesnakes.<eos>: 6.675622827738825
He’s in
there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel.<eos>: 23.370754736158485

Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar,
or they’d taste it with the hot tea.<eos>: 73.2039705590275
Or is it from her?<eos>: 35.986384036653355
A barefoot arab
stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes.<eos>: 38.07144521151839
Deaden the gnaw of

—There must be a new moon out, she said.<eos>: 30.409586280324906
He’s always bad then.<eos>: 28.077123264025627
Do you
know what he did last night?

Her hand ceased to rummage.<eos>: 26.48755028334638
Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in
alarm, yet smiling.

—What?<eos>: 65.52477097821104
Mr Bloom asked.

Let her speak.<eos>: 21.47363875914085
Look straight in her eyes.<eos>: 21.073543420054794
I believe you.<eos>: 8.681906521625788
Trust me.

—Woke me up in the night, she said.<eos>: 14.67004053458724
Dream he had, a nightmare.

Indiges.

—Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.

—The ace of spades!<eos>: 42.256825121047164
Mr Bloom said.

She took a folded postcard from her handbag.

—Read that, she said.<eos>: 20.873153664060762
He got it this morning.

—What is it?<eos>: 16.830025822513626
Mr Bloom asked, taking the card.<eos>: 14.576389951237328
U.<eos>: 1.6621382579199797
P.?

—U.<eos>: 22.23336415924512
p: up, she said.<eos>: 9.297931343730196
Someone taking a rise out of him.<eos>: 23.53255917169274
It’s a great
shame for them whoever he is.

—Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.

She took back the card, sighing.

—And now he’s going round to Mr Menton’s office.<eos>: 30.81111161508044
He’s going to take an
action for ten thousand pounds, he says.

She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.

Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching.<eos>: 62.59000486782416

—Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy?<eos>: 43.58431132387024
Mr Bloom asked.

—Mina Purefoy?<eos>: 19.806505522707955
she said.

Dr Horne got her in.<eos>: 83.38633053961445
She’s three

—O, Mr Bloom said.<eos>: 14.84433160333542
I’m sorry to hear that.

—Yes, Mrs Breen said.<eos>: 13.336340343319359
And a houseful of kids at home.<eos>: 27.795261405107986
It’s a very stiff
birth, the nurse told me.

—O, Mr Bloom said.

His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news.<eos>: 32.992787934835825
His tongue clacked in
compassion.<eos>: 13.205555222191565

Mrs Breen nodded.

—She was taken bad on the Tuesday...

Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:

—Mind!<eos>: 47.470833603395334
Let this man pass.

A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a
rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass.<eos>: 80.31219506862888
Tight as a

From his arm a folded dustcoat,
a stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.

—Watch him, Mr Bloom said.<eos>: 28.875813073073953
He always walks outside the lampposts.
Watch!

—Who is he if it’s a fair question?<eos>: 40.04959634163813
Mrs Breen asked.<eos>: 7.612109492733472

Bloom said smiling.<eos>: 16.266908746594144

Blown in from the bay.

He suffered her to overtake him without surprise and
thrust his dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he
spoke earnestly.

Meshuggah.<eos>: 95.55988214190438
Off his chump.

Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the
tight skullpiece, the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat.<eos>: 53.94379928581154

He went towards the window and, taking up the pettycash book, scanned
its pages.

Ay.

He drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the
flutes.

—Ay, he said, sighing.

Mr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh.<eos>: 25.78559938777072

Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do
there to do.<eos>: 111.31163729703067
A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and
walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men
lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.

When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book:

—What is this he is?<eos>: 85.07566543826476
Isn’t he in the insurance line?

—He’s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said.<eos>: 15.77615185739177
He does canvassing for
the _Freeman._

—I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said.<eos>: 21.493756790278166
Is he in trouble?

—Trouble?<eos>: 40.98495817449253
Nosey Flynn said.<eos>: 2.6450036954725737
Not that I heard of.<eos>: 29.881921026355368
Why?

—I noticed he was in mourning.

—Was he?<eos>: 25.981789050575923
Nosey Flynn said.<eos>: 2.6450036954725737
So he was, faith.<eos>: 11.4152527292188
I asked him how was all at
home.<eos>: 46.03029139430147
You’re right, by God.<eos>: 12.552631522608195
So he was.

—I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a
gentleman is in trouble that way.<eos>: 27.149219629686346
It only brings it up fresh in their
minds.

—It’s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said.<eos>: 31.966157053110646
I met him the day before
yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan’s
wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home
to his better half.<eos>: 82.44144495918758
She’s well nourished, I tell you.<eos>: 12.639825414962058
Plovers on toast.

—And is he doing for the _Freeman?_ Davy Byrne said.

Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.

—He doesn’t buy cream on the ads he picks up.<eos>: 36.71515688741156
You can make bacon of
that.

—How so?<eos>: 41.855573046121485
Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.

Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers.<eos>: 42.648031617932915
He
winked.

—He’s in the craft, he said.

—Do you tell me so?<eos>: 9.373715762216948
Davy Byrne said.

—Very much so, Nosey Flynn said.<eos>: 12.313096157624416
Ancient free and accepted order.<eos>: 57.862129218584556
He’s
an excellent brother.<eos>: 21.64697063116138
Light, life and love, by God.<eos>: 39.89679084886297
They give him a leg
up.<eos>: 21.529326870041416
I was told that by a—well, I won’t say who.

—Is that a fact?

—O, it’s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said.<eos>: 21.45083619707123
They stick to you when you’re
down.<eos>: 28.616618259142925
I know a fellow was trying to get into it.<eos>: 21.934527823580776
But they’re as close
as damn it.<eos>: 32.4233430574378
By God they did right to keep the women out of it.

Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one:

—Iiiiiichaaaaaaach!

—There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find
out what they do be doing.<eos>: 48.09392988678432
But be damned but they smelt her out and
swore her in on the spot a master mason.<eos>: 114.5815834393666
That was one of the saint
Legers of Doneraile.

Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:

—And is that a fact?<eos>: 29.557129688967116
Decent quiet man he is.<eos>: 31.345174170135298
I often saw him in here
and I never once saw him—you know, over the line.

—God Almighty couldn’t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly.<eos>: 40.796005661719434
Slips
off when the fun gets too hot.<eos>: 88.90178616758742
Didn’t you see him look at his watch?
Ah, you weren’t there.<eos>: 27.982265187154834
If you ask him to have a drink first thing he
does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe.<eos>: 37.89557268443514
Declare to
God he does.

—There are some like that, Davy Byrne said.<eos>: 23.558499414385782
He’s a safe man, I’d say.

—He’s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up.<eos>: 17.270918045934934
He’s been known
to put his hand down too to help a fellow.<eos>: 47.11236401483819
Give the devil his due.<eos>: 70.79648536848126
O,
Bloom has his good points.<eos>: 51.87442199281681
But there’s one thing he’ll never do.

His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.

—I know, Davy Byrne said.

—Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.

Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in.<eos>: 39.603848568049834
Tom Rochford followed frowning,
a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.

—Day, Mr Byrne.

—Day, gentlemen.

They paused at the counter.

—Who’s standing?<eos>: 41.597658985142395
Paddy Leonard asked.

—I’m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.

—Well, what’ll it be?<eos>: 19.131869686811317
Paddy Leonard asked.

—I’ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.

—How much?<eos>: 17.502407923240018
Paddy Leonard cried.<eos>: 8.313074476507715
Since when, for God’ sake?<eos>: 31.800101364235037
What’s
yours, Tom?

—How is the main drainage?<eos>: 32.12703912306193
Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.

For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and
hiccupped.

—Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne?<eos>: 50.40770293304496
he said.

—Certainly, sir.

Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.

—Lord love a duck, he said.<eos>: 22.58892460305087
Look at what I’m standing drinks to!<eos>: 53.65365431093203
Cold
water and gingerpop!<eos>: 15.771187059308941
Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.
He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup.<eos>: 181.79024930926897
A dead snip.

—Zinfandel is it?<eos>: 13.856447642148572
Nosey Flynn asked.

Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set
before him.

—That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.

—Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.

Tom Rochford nodded and drank.

—Is it Zinfandel?

—Say nothing!<eos>: 39.03152227530078
Bantam Lyons winked.<eos>: 18.45774465550435
I’m going to plunge five bob on my
own.

—Tell us if you’re worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard
said.<eos>: 29.503086856976857
Who gave it to you?

Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.

—So long!<eos>: 62.99850661724279
Nosey Flynn said.

The others turned.

—That’s the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.

—Prrwht!<eos>: 19.93817600105254
Paddy Leonard said with scorn.<eos>: 16.139859563696824
Mr Byrne, sir, we’ll take two
of your small Jamesons after that and a...

—Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.

—Ay, Paddy Leonard said.<eos>: 40.88838510617684
A suckingbottle for the baby.

Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth
smooth.<eos>: 44.61555966405932
Something green it would have to be: spinach, say.<eos>: 45.99000822049561
Then with
those Röntgen rays searchlight you could.

At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the
cobblestones and lapped it with new zest.<eos>: 69.46899680142054

Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of
his?<eos>: 72.85982575763198
Wasting time explaining it to Flynn’s mouth.<eos>: 52.37295904121565
Lean people long
mouths.<eos>: 169.39419835414924
Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and
invent free.<eos>: 88.54798319578359
Course then you’d have all the cranks pestering.

He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars:

     Don Giovanni, a cenar teco
     M’invitasti.

Feel better.<eos>: 43.94236938386464
Burgundy.<eos>: 1.6180879268818849

That _Kilkenny People_ in the national
library now I must.

Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller,
plumber, turned back his thoughts.<eos>: 48.076213033838926
They could: and watch it all the way
down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour
round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric
juice coils of intestines like pipes.<eos>: 139.8915676406242
But the poor buffer would have to
stand all the time with his insides entrails on show.<eos>: 45.37268565116671
Science.

—_A cenar teco._

What does that _teco_ mean?<eos>: 28.048389740117166
Tonight perhaps.

     Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited
     To come to supper tonight,
     The rum the rumdum.

Doesn’t go properly.

Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to.<eos>: 93.28018345425241

On the pig’s back.

Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new
garters.

Today.<eos>: 82.32055521614424
Today.<eos>: 1.9623753105978345
Not think.

Tour the south then.<eos>: 62.60387999552089

Will eat anything.

Mr Bloom turned at Gray’s confectioner’s window of unbought tarts and
passed the reverend Thomas Connellan’s bookstore.<eos>: 23.62937205768658
_Why I left the
church of Rome?<eos>: 50.188796747330095

Why we left the church of Rome.

A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane.<eos>: 62.32312687170762
No
tram in sight.<eos>: 55.465456510017006
Wants to cross.

—Do you want to cross?<eos>: 16.23111347074156
Mr Bloom asked.

The blind stripling did not answer.<eos>: 19.97238704373115
His wallface frowned weakly.<eos>: 13.027208418211258
He
moved his head uncertainly.

—You’re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said.<eos>: 13.41090230105055
Molesworth street is opposite.
Do you want to cross?<eos>: 62.546457278716275
There’s nothing in the way.

The cane moved out trembling to the left.<eos>: 30.414950819206577
Mr Bloom’s eye followed its
line and saw again the dyeworks’ van drawn up before Drago’s.<eos>: 63.68749396569542
Where I
saw his brillantined hair just when I was.<eos>: 37.366524719807984
Horse drooping.<eos>: 20.243994003850897
Driver in
John Long’s.<eos>: 39.525556965882316
Slaking his drouth.

—There’s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it’s not moving.<eos>: 19.821832294787786
I’ll see you
across.<eos>: 18.725760998888063
Do you want to go to Molesworth street?

—Yes, the stripling answered.<eos>: 18.53015233904233
South Frederick street.

—Come, Mr Bloom said.

He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to
guide it forward.

Say something to him.<eos>: 72.54421617129677
Better not do the condescending.<eos>: 14.127770592204733
They mistrust
what you tell them.<eos>: 22.170054569707915
Pass a common remark.

—The rain kept off.

No answer.

Stains on his coat.<eos>: 54.62932995196606
Slobbers his food, I suppose.<eos>: 29.542569294591775
Tastes all different
for him.<eos>: 29.32016976034839
Have to be spoonfed first.<eos>: 17.598707115479524
Like a child’s hand, his hand.<eos>: 18.197820196022324
Like
Milly’s was.<eos>: 32.17857332340269
Sensitive.<eos>: 2.6916811167219663
Sizing me up I daresay from my hand.<eos>: 50.73368361920341
Wonder if
he has a name.<eos>: 16.572403469593517
Van.<eos>: 2.1244962477287723
Keep his cane clear of the horse’s legs: tired
drudge get his doze.<eos>: 69.73200149744568
That’s right.<eos>: 5.715785957214435
Clear.<eos>: 3.62231998241166
Behind a bull: in front of a
horse.

—Thanks, sir.

Knows I’m a man.<eos>: 25.042373775481714
Voice.

—Right now?<eos>: 28.42576924974188
First turn to the left.

The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing
his cane back, feeling again.

Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone
tweed.<eos>: 41.01411606542513
Poor young fellow!<eos>: 16.978361787205174
How on earth did he know that van was there?
Must have felt it.<eos>: 92.66270926226143
See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense
of volume.<eos>: 80.0369977825136
Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark.
Wonder would he feel it if something was removed.<eos>: 77.09573099182829
Feel a gap.<eos>: 15.597049419517619
Queer
idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones.<eos>: 68.31348475828516
Could
he walk in a beeline if he hadn’t that cane?<eos>: 28.483196251156212
Bloodless pious face like
a fellow going in to be a priest.

Penrose!<eos>: 97.44978690747492
That was that chap’s name.

Look at all the things they can learn to do.<eos>: 34.63559395408514
Read with their fingers.
Tune pianos.<eos>: 31.610585815239556
Or we are surprised they have any brains.<eos>: 67.31382921682604
Why we think a
deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might
say.<eos>: 66.48327154807642
Of course the other senses are more.<eos>: 64.23814752217132
Embroider.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Plait baskets.
People ought to help.<eos>: 29.42586602952098
Workbasket I could buy for Molly’s birthday.
Hates sewing.<eos>: 23.17316902978987
Might take an objection.<eos>: 10.149933291540123
Dark men they call them.

Sense of smell must be stronger too.<eos>: 60.28823568844125
Smells on all sides, bunched
together.<eos>: 21.663768445464342
Each street different smell.<eos>: 126.34192978485673
Each person too.<eos>: 21.874517613930347
Then the
spring, the summer: smells.<eos>: 80.63773966536455
Tastes?<eos>: 7.768561932275612
They say you can’t taste wines with
your eyes shut or a cold in the head.<eos>: 40.89042076254739
Also smoke in the dark they say
get no pleasure.

And with a woman, for instance.<eos>: 84.87222568451166
More shameless not seeing.<eos>: 43.99896791271074
That girl
passing the Stewart institution, head in the air.<eos>: 33.252313644696684
Look at me.<eos>: 8.901065240081753
I have
them all on.<eos>: 35.901470590805246
Must be strange not to see her.<eos>: 28.276727267158147
Kind of a form in his
mind’s eye.<eos>: 15.807669372545183
The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his
fingers must almost see the lines, the curves.<eos>: 70.44518657627941
His hands on her hair,
for instance.<eos>: 30.34210448788016
Say it was black, for instance.<eos>: 22.198162037730444
Good.<eos>: 5.7636952636093595
We call it black.
Then passing over her white skin.<eos>: 77.73178873523516
Different feel perhaps.<eos>: 46.826892882177866
Feeling of
white.

Postoffice.<eos>: 37.57361359379509
Must answer.<eos>: 7.479223741823334
Fag today.<eos>: 8.485601214505586
Send her a postal order two
shillings, half a crown.<eos>: 80.5422163917096
Accept my little present.<eos>: 20.339576173090247
Stationer’s just
here too.<eos>: 28.028724788108878
Wait.<eos>: 2.366011761982759
Think over it.

With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above
his ears.<eos>: 106.93327441441699
Again.<eos>: 2.296053679267296
Fibres of fine fine straw.<eos>: 81.58316329046819
Then gently his finger felt
the skin of his right cheek.<eos>: 53.047881355227666
Downy hair there too.<eos>: 52.518242231368944
Not smooth enough.
The belly is the smoothest.<eos>: 42.38637072746155
No-one about.<eos>: 30.652982593701456
There he goes into Frederick
street.<eos>: 32.13183335718965
Perhaps to Levenston’s dancing academy piano.<eos>: 23.451584316580853
Might be settling
my braces.

Walking by Doran’s publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat
and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of
his belly.<eos>: 54.57749082930675
But I know it’s whitey yellow.<eos>: 15.302670682722685
Want to try in the dark to
see.

He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.

Poor fellow!<eos>: 42.86594037690416
Quite a boy.<eos>: 11.300948988680371
Terrible.<eos>: 2.3374236762072886
Really terrible.<eos>: 14.832713315134512
What dreams would
he have, not seeing?<eos>: 66.46766213174007
Life a dream for him.<eos>: 20.981995815830842
Where is the justice being
born that way?<eos>: 55.862192079176666
All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned
and drowned in New York.<eos>: 91.61052883604742
Holocaust.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Karma they call that transmigration
for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses.
Dear, dear, dear.<eos>: 84.75447207448148
Pity, of course: but somehow you can’t cotton on to
them someway.

I suppose he’d turn up his nose
at that stuff I drank.<eos>: 41.31379352823434
Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a
dusty bottle.<eos>: 81.26753921189187
Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder’s court.
Wellmeaning old man.<eos>: 41.80731124867744

What about going out

Drop in on Keyes.<eos>: 32.77601439778332
No use sticking to him like a
leech.<eos>: 24.06793314685965
Wear out my welcome.<eos>: 59.285846370611054
Sure to know someone on the gate.

Turnedup trousers.<eos>: 11.431371840891583
It is.<eos>: 6.84500258575296
It is.

He swerved
to the right.

Is it?<eos>: 20.86778987197271
Almost certain.<eos>: 41.15758762054469
Won’t look.<eos>: 7.423623808406115
Wine in my face.<eos>: 12.492818445224115
Why did I?<eos>: 8.789760088183039
Too
heady.<eos>: 4.422120198014982
Yes, it is.<eos>: 7.869554034236928
The walk.<eos>: 9.69750278700665
Not see.<eos>: 7.119706375082901
Get on.

Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.
Handsome building.<eos>: 151.99163846091267
Sir Thomas Deane designed.<eos>: 12.875913685315515
Not following me?

Didn’t see me perhaps.<eos>: 22.808536628826015
Light in his eyes.

The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs.<eos>: 50.915881247019776
Quick.<eos>: 2.337322066741968
Cold
statues: quiet there.<eos>: 63.447796472527386
Safe in a minute.

No.<eos>: 28.42961607298363
Didn’t see me.<eos>: 4.0295711920221935
After two.<eos>: 9.666538866372314
Just at the gate.

My heart!

His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone.<eos>: 96.84578142521724
Sir
Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.

Look for something I.

His hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded
Agendath Netaim.<eos>: 159.65194117031996
Where did I?

Busy looking.

He thrust back quick Agendath.

Afternoon she said.

I am looking for that.<eos>: 79.55329809738241
Yes, that.<eos>: 9.49899124194609

Walk quietly.<eos>: 9.591038286685807
Moment more.<eos>: 8.84136497098657
My heart.

His hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap

Ah soap there I yes.<eos>: 41.668182449315374
Gate.

Safe!

Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred:

—And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of _Wilhelm Meister_.
A great poet on a great brother poet.<eos>: 65.70235919918589
A hesitating soul taking arms
against a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in
real life.

He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step
backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.

A noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a
noiseless beck.

—Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering.<eos>: 92.18959692194176
The beautiful
ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts.<eos>: 76.51975296203882
One always
feels that Goethe’s judgments are so true.<eos>: 37.95962241165956
True in the larger analysis.

Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off.<eos>: 10.173211090857816
Bald, most zealous by the door
he gave his large ear all to the attendant’s words: heard them: and was
gone.

Two left.

—Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes
before his death.

—Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton asked with
elder’s gall, to write _Paradise Lost_ at your dictation?<eos>: 70.77334464333387
_The Sorrows
of Satan_ he calls it.

Smile.<eos>: 27.45204832787008
Smile Cranly’s smile.

     First he tickled her
     Then he patted her
     Then he passed the female catheter
     For he was a medical
     Jolly old medi...

—I feel you would need one more for _Hamlet._ Seven is dear to the
mystic mind.<eos>: 98.07216195238516
The shining seven W.B.<eos>: 60.83398004803046
calls them.

Glittereyed his rufous skull close to his greencapped desklamp sought
the face bearded amid darkgreener shadow, an ollav, holyeyed.<eos>: 45.159619093991445

Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light.<eos>: 48.23302869391705
He bore in his hand with
grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.

—That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet’s musings about
the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and
undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato’s.

John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:

—Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle
with Plato.

—Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his
commonwealth?

—I was showing him Jubainville’s book.<eos>: 37.88503330693414

From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.

—Mallarmé, don’t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose
poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris.<eos>: 49.25108807197023

—The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.

John Eglinton laughed.

—Yes, I suppose it would be, he said.<eos>: 20.678682147951037
Excellent people, no doubt, but
distressingly shortsighted in some matters.

Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.

—A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said.<eos>: 41.09978596743963

—He will have it that _Hamlet_ is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for
Mr Best’s behoof.<eos>: 27.77117966042619
Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our
flesh creep.

     If thou didst ever...


—What is a ghost?<eos>: 44.73037237616574
Stephen said with tingling energy.<eos>: 16.722428913067258
One who has faded
into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of
manners.<eos>: 179.64410143263913

John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.

Lifted.

—It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a
swift glance their hearing.<eos>: 73.95827022445248

bankside.<eos>: 14.868176167575683

Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!

—The play begins.<eos>: 67.73882214998835
A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the
castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice.<eos>: 74.80623339675311
It is
the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare
who has studied _Hamlet_ all the years of his life which were not
vanity in order to play the part of the spectre.<eos>: 52.048081962322456
He speaks the words to
Burbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of
cerecloth, calling him by a name:

     Hamlet, I am thy father’s spirit,

bidding him list.<eos>: 55.622806148387674
To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince,
young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has
died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.

Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in
the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words
to his own son’s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been
prince Hamlet’s twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that
he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises:
you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is
the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?

—But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began
impatiently.

Art thou there, truepenny?

—Interesting only to the parish clerk.<eos>: 89.7936604022455
I mean, we have the plays.<eos>: 25.02541393811693
I
mean when we read the poetry of _King Lear_ what is it to us how the

Mr Best’s face, appealed to, agreed.

Marry, I wanted it.

Her ghost at least has been laid

She died, for literature at least, before she was born.

—She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born.<eos>: 54.474093952430195
She
saw him into and out of the world.<eos>: 17.91978863577803
She took his first embraces.<eos>: 35.19479617951407
She
bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids
closed when he lay on his deathbed.

I wept alone.

John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.

—The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got
out of it as quickly and as best he could.

—Bosh!<eos>: 56.03797723060228
Stephen said rudely.<eos>: 25.56400683173156
A man of genius makes no mistakes.<eos>: 37.4608075399767
His
errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.

Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian,
softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.

—A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of
discovery, one should imagine.<eos>: 42.31327163387512
What useful discovery did Socrates learn
from Xanthippe?

—Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts
into the world.<eos>: 92.28523450194061
What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (_absit
nomen!_), Socratididion’s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever
know.<eos>: 38.33516993365655
But neither the midwife’s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him
from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.

—But Ann Hathaway?<eos>: 25.22377760096366
Mr Best’s quiet voice said forgetfully.<eos>: 31.494780377373406
Yes, we seem
to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.

His look went from brooder’s beard to carper’s skull, to remind, to
chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard,
guiltless though maligned.

—He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.
He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling
_The girl I left behind me._ If the earthquake did not time it we
should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of
hounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows.<eos>: 58.705630890566106

and Adonis_, lay in the bedchamber of every light-of-love in London.<eos>: 43.21558072460709

The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping
to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford
wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.

And my turn?<eos>: 79.86074440127261
When?

Come!

—Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly,
brightly.

He murmured then with blond delight for all:

     Between the acres of the rye
     These pretty countryfolk would lie.

Paris: the wellpleased pleaser.

A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its
cooperative watch.

—I am afraid I am due at the _Homestead._

Whither away?<eos>: 70.0559979698682
Exploitable ground.

—Are you going?<eos>: 24.22847538493603

Piper is coming.

—Piper!<eos>: 36.98740554800359

Is Piper back?

Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.

—Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising.<eos>: 33.085784796452494
If you will be
so kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman...

—O, yes.<eos>: 36.385457026470085
If he considers it important it will go in.<eos>: 39.427749132817794
We have so much
correspondence.

—I understand, Stephen said.<eos>: 11.759188634371355
Thanks.

God ild you.<eos>: 15.865570258432674

Stephen sat down.

The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers.<eos>: 18.858595476441245
Blushing, his mask
said:

—Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.

He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a
chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:

—Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?

Alarmed face asks me.<eos>: 53.5879094995382
Why did he come?<eos>: 22.850864298637052
Courtesy or an inward light?

—Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been
first a sundering.

—Yes.

And in New Place a slack
dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as
cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow
grave and unforgiven.

—Yes.<eos>: 93.61397830765249
So you think...

The door closed behind the outgoer.

Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and
brooding air.

A vestal’s lamp.

Here he ponders things that were not: what Cæsar would have lived to do
had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of
the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore
when he lived among women.

Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.
Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned.<eos>: 69.94408779978774

Still: but an itch of
death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak
their will.

—Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most
enigmatic.<eos>: 49.31481896008419
We know nothing but that he lived and suffered.<eos>: 53.40594625114372
Not even so
much.<eos>: 15.911332483200315
Others abide our question.<eos>: 28.91359367899139
A shadow hangs over all the rest.

—But _Hamlet_ is so personal, isn’t it?<eos>: 46.32756487297193
Mr Best pleaded.<eos>: 6.46023086208807
I mean, a kind
of private paper, don’t you know, of his private life.<eos>: 27.646688724750135
I mean, I don’t
care a button, don’t you know, who is killed or who is guilty...

He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his
defiance.<eos>: 38.09227189321944

Put beurla on it, littlejohn.

Quoth littlejohn Eglinton:

—I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I
may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that
Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.

Bear with me.

Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under
wrinkled brows.<eos>: 76.08072564796092

Messer
Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.

—As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said,
from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the
artist weave and unweave his image.<eos>: 66.90381666311049
And as the mole on my right breast
is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of
new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father
the image of the unliving son looks forth.<eos>: 110.37413198996757
In the intense instant of
imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which
I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to
be.<eos>: 83.3615331505473
So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit
here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.

Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.

—Yes, Mr Best said youngly.<eos>: 52.49102954255343
I feel Hamlet quite young.<eos>: 93.54443996952742
The bitterness
might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from
the son.

Has the wrong sow by the lug.<eos>: 72.49064937726942
He is in my father.<eos>: 16.52490488671605
I am in his son.

—That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.

John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.

—If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug
in the market.<eos>: 29.792332178315345
The plays of Shakespeare’s later years which Renan
admired so much breathe another spirit.

—The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.

—There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a
sundering.

Said that.

—If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over
the hell of time of _King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida,_
look to see when and how the shadow lifts.<eos>: 57.51031120751014
What softens the heart of a
man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles,
prince of Tyre?

Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.

—A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.

—The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant
quantity, John Eglinton detected.<eos>: 27.985756512017687
The highroads are dreary but they
lead to the town.

     How many miles to Dublin?
     Three score and ten, sir.
     Will we be there by candlelight?

—Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing
period.

—Does he?<eos>: 57.69782821160703
What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his
name is, say of it?

—Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita,
that which was lost.<eos>: 46.679583294574876
What was lost is given back to him: his daughter’s
child.<eos>: 56.047376615728595
_My dearest wife_, Pericles says, _was like this maid._ Will any
man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?

—The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur.<eos>: 77.73036593739128
_L’art d’être

—Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added,
another image?

Do you know what you are talking about?<eos>: 57.7702776947436
Love, yes.<eos>: 5.780818096133384

—His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of
all experience, material and moral.<eos>: 34.44790281807754
Such an appeal will touch him.<eos>: 79.54146041883978
The
images of other males of his blood will repel him.<eos>: 57.65772301713409
He will see in them
grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself.

The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.

—I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of
the public.<eos>: 44.14403399077561
And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr
George Bernard Shaw.<eos>: 51.105425237418444
Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris.<eos>: 94.39229946801755
His articles
on Shakespeare in the _Saturday Review_ were surely brilliant.<eos>: 112.77785492110596
Oddly
enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of
the sonnets.<eos>: 97.97436420617034
The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke.<eos>: 32.68159823253265
I
own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more
in harmony with—what shall I say?—our notions of what ought not to have
been.

Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk’s egg,
prize of their fray.

Dost love, Miriam?<eos>: 62.45373964118164

—That may be too, Stephen said.<eos>: 41.32299709847194
There’s a saying of Goethe’s which Mr
Magee likes to quote.<eos>: 27.884354474013094
Beware of what you wish for in youth because you
will get it in middle life.<eos>: 62.32096999671458
Why does he send to one who is a
_buonaroba,_ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a
scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him?<eos>: 74.37707248439897
He was himself a lord
of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had
written _Romeo and Juliet_.<eos>: 46.522290855410894
Why?<eos>: 4.396144867849921
Belief in himself has been untimely
killed.<eos>: 70.11631843373515
He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say)
and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play
victoriously the game of laugh and lie down.<eos>: 59.469408837917335
Assumed dongiovannism will
not save him.<eos>: 28.38277110281827
No later undoing will undo the first undoing.<eos>: 84.54282374558433

If the shrew
is worsted yet there remains to her woman’s invisible weapon.<eos>: 86.82908848264299
There is,
I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new
passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own
understanding of himself.<eos>: 63.791053009535275
A like fate awaits him and the two rages
commingle in a whirlpool.

They list.<eos>: 30.775930617247084
And in the porches of their ears I pour.

—The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the
porch of a sleeping ear.<eos>: 56.38121786674934
But those who are done to death in sleep
cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their
souls with that knowledge in the life to come.<eos>: 110.39121193809623
The poisoning and the
beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet’s ghost could not know
of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator.<eos>: 93.63097963213704
That is why the
speech (his lean unlovely English) is always turned elsewhere,
backward.<eos>: 118.70761810616163
Ravisher and ravished, what he would but would not, go with
him from Lucrece’s bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen’s breast, bare,
with its mole cinquespotted.<eos>: 40.08927763753252
He goes back, weary of the creation he has
piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore.<eos>: 123.60777560711125
But,
because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished
personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he
has revealed.<eos>: 77.16352880312053
His beaver is up.<eos>: 49.416656758193255
He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind
by Elsinore’s rocks or what you will, the sea’s voice, a voice heard
only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son
consubstantial with the father.

—Amen!<eos>: 63.038659392969564
was responded from the doorway.

Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?

_Entr’acte_.

A ribald face, sullen as a dean’s, Buck Mulligan came forward, then
blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles.<eos>: 64.57153403091054
My telegram.

—You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not?<eos>: 41.65337712362915
he
asked of Stephen.

Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a
bauble.

They make him welcome.<eos>: 56.7129663773494
_Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch dienen._

crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven
and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His
Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and
dead when all the quick shall be dead already.

O, flowers!<eos>: 18.363232248498708
Bells with bells with bells
aquiring.

—Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said.<eos>: 21.715738522804877
A most instructive discussion.
Mr Mulligan, I’ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of
Shakespeare.<eos>: 67.72274177884077
All sides of life should be represented.

He smiled on all sides equally.

Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled:

—Shakespeare?<eos>: 49.72969926931714
he said.<eos>: 3.492439908750907
I seem to know the name.

A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.

—To be sure, he said, remembering brightly.<eos>: 38.37007649232237
The chap that writes like
Synge.

Mr Best turned to him.

—Haines missed you, he said.<eos>: 48.11560390932249
Did you meet him?<eos>: 10.206480708836636

He’s gone to Gill’s to buy Hyde’s _Lovesongs of Connacht_.

—I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said.<eos>: 16.296709865289024
Was he here?

—The bard’s fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired
perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising.<eos>: 31.88258418782512
I hear that an actress
played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin.
Vining held that the prince was a woman.<eos>: 75.8722120140765
Has no-one made him out to be
an Irishman?<eos>: 55.77853702626203
Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues.<eos>: 16.260133529350863
He
swears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.

—The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde’s, Mr Best said,
lifting his brilliant notebook.<eos>: 42.58232449406496
That _Portrait of Mr W.<eos>: 15.584819935803639
H._ where he
proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all
hues.

—For Willie Hughes, is it not?<eos>: 46.325763378820234
the quaker librarian asked.

Or Hughie Wills?<eos>: 33.33078541193718
Mr William Himself.<eos>: 21.11374156531185
W.<eos>: 1.343769496026818
H.: who am I?

—I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily.<eos>: 32.96397538130117
Of
course it’s all paradox, don’t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the
colour, but it’s so typical the way he works it out.<eos>: 27.617897464549362
It’s the very
essence of Wilde, don’t you know.<eos>: 13.075736182313602
The light touch.

His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.
Tame essence of Wilde.

You’re darned witty.<eos>: 51.82170908536774
Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan
Deasy’s ducats.

A snake coils her, fang in’s kiss.

—Do you think it is only a paradox?<eos>: 28.438848177751
the quaker librarian was asking.
The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.

They talked seriously of mocker’s seriousness.

Buck Mulligan’s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile.<eos>: 75.72970364609041
Then, his head
wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket.<eos>: 62.20111032801205
His
mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.

—Telegram!<eos>: 59.3851513628871

O, you peerless mummer!
O, you priestified Kinchite!

Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a
querulous brogue:

—It’s what I’m telling you, mister honey, it’s queer and sick we were,
Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in.<eos>: 55.4119885079595
’Twas murmur we did

And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery’s

He wailed:

—And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your
conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the
drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.

Stephen laughed.

Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.

—The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you.<eos>: 65.99143880702492
He heard
you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule.<eos>: 28.239532679856477
He’s out in pampooties to
murder you.

—Me!<eos>: 30.222607336274557
Stephen exclaimed.<eos>: 9.900976163603582
That was your contribution to literature.

Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping
ceiling.

—Murder you!<eos>: 38.15141629694175
he laughed.

So Mr Justice Madden in his
_Diary of Master William Silence_ has found the hunting terms...<eos>: 175.00859415242297
Yes?
What is it?

—There’s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and
offering a card.<eos>: 20.884895456368447
From the _Freeman._ He wants to see the files of the
_Kilkenny People_ for last year.

—Certainly, certainly, certainly.<eos>: 29.226498533598157
Is the gentleman?...

He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked,
asked, creaked, asked:

—Is he?...<eos>: 83.54575373890964
O, there!

Brisk in a galliard he was off, out.<eos>: 38.715253140456284
In the daylit corridor he talked
with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most
honest broadbrim.

—This gentleman?<eos>: 84.42700684488028
_Freeman’s Journal?<eos>: 6.994696945373837
Kilkenny People?_ To be sure.<eos>: 34.33914043854462
Good

_Kilkenny_...<eos>: 8.798089879034146
We have certainly...

A patient silhouette waited, listening.

—All the leading provincial...<eos>: 88.13311816083463

This way...<eos>: 98.38133197946298
Please, sir...

Voluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing
dark figure following his hasty heels.

The door closed.

—The sheeny!<eos>: 51.979807954343414
Buck Mulligan cried.

He jumped up and snatched the card.

—What’s his name?<eos>: 11.473862728399729
Ikey Moses?<eos>: 30.58169334344367
Bloom.

He rattled on:

—Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more.<eos>: 22.979609714485257
I found him over in the
museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite.<eos>: 33.71617006756989

_Life of life, thy lips enkindle._

Suddenly he turned to Stephen:

—He knows you.<eos>: 26.861635954303804
He knows your old fellow.<eos>: 24.600853372836593
O, I fear me, he is Greeker
than the Greeks.<eos>: 24.292232453735643
His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.
Venus Kallipyge.<eos>: 43.6379790440709
O, the thunder of those loins!<eos>: 35.99168648522217
_The god pursuing the
maiden hid_.

—We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best’s approval.
We begin to be interested in Mrs S.<eos>: 45.18596902765729
Till now we had thought of her, if
at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.

—Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty
from Kyrios Menelaus’ brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy
in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope.<eos>: 56.407950392219774
Twenty
years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a
salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland.<eos>: 60.823417712501055
His life was
rich.<eos>: 42.53299560247803
His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called
it, is the art of surfeit.<eos>: 35.9952597317638
Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack,
honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons,
ringocandies.<eos>: 14.077373776306105
Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a
million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays.<eos>: 70.20459233760029
The
gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of
Sheba.<eos>: 24.820890501103012
Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its
chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures.<eos>: 92.67167838959615
You know
Manningham’s story of the burgher’s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her
bed after she had seen him in _Richard III_ and how Shakespeare,
overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns
and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon’s
blankets: _William the conqueror came before Richard III_.<eos>: 61.27524023042994
And the gay
lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady
Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the
punks of the bankside, a penny a time.

—The height of fine society.<eos>: 35.90374903924101
And sir William Davenant of Oxford’s
mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.

Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:

—Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!

—And Harry of six wives’ daughter.<eos>: 84.49365819106663
And other lady friends from
neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings.<eos>: 199.0838027071746
But all those
twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing
behind the diamond panes?

Do and do.<eos>: 148.6291783180571
Thing done.<eos>: 10.55753765060778
In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist,
he walks, greyedauburn.<eos>: 12.342612534359615
An azured harebell like her veins.<eos>: 20.16773200451865
Lids of
Juno’s eyes, violets.<eos>: 14.611552414683553
He walks.<eos>: 8.538970970765927
One life is all.<eos>: 20.261172524070737
One body.<eos>: 13.28673994134252
Do.<eos>: 3.7250090377912275
But do.
Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.

Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton’s desk sharply.

—Whom do you suspect?<eos>: 48.430152340233136
he challenged.

—Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets.<eos>: 42.48643429747654
Once spurned twice
spurned.<eos>: 149.41222532207834
But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.

Love that dare not speak its name.

—As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a
lord.

Old wall where sudden lizards flash.<eos>: 131.10412060585048
At Charenton I watched them.

—It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all
other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for
the stallion.<eos>: 32.66479644456656
Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he
had a shrew to wife.<eos>: 60.33144502015401
But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a
bedvow.<eos>: 21.68455365551686
Two deeds are rank in that ghost’s mind: a broken vow and the
dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband’s
brother.<eos>: 84.40664884961966
Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood.<eos>: 41.38190529514848
Once a wooer,
twice a wooer.

Stephen turned boldly in his chair.

—The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning.<eos>: 35.38882297990515
If you
deny that in the fifth scene of _Hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy
tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years
between the day she married him and the day she buried him.<eos>: 88.9838690829202
All those
women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her
poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the
first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her
sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan’s daughter, Elizabeth, to use
granddaddy’s words, wed her second, having killed her first.

O, yes, mention there is.<eos>: 76.38690726624097
In the years when he was living richly in
royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her
father’s shepherd.<eos>: 64.37550663507344
Explain you then.<eos>: 14.046886103570245
Explain the swansong too wherein
he has commended her to posterity.

He faced their silence.

To whom thus Eglinton: You mean the will.
But that has been explained, I believe, by jurists.
She was entitled to her widow’s dower
At common law.<eos>: 67.31654480054627
His legal knowledge was great
Our judges tell us.
            Him Satan fleers,
Mocker:
            And therefore he left out her name
From the first draft but he did not leave out
The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,
For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford
And in London.<eos>: 77.61611800127677
And therefore when he was urged,
As I believe, to name her
He left her his
Secondbest
Bed.

            _Punkt._

Leftherhis
Secondbest
Leftherhis
Bestabed
Secabest
Leftabed.

Woa!

—Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as
they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.

—He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and
landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist
shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer.<eos>: 76.30752002190403
Why did he not leave her
his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in
peace?

—It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr
Secondbest Best said finely.

—_Separatio a mensa et a thalamo_, bettered Buck Mulligan and was
smiled on.

—Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.
Let me think.

—Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage,
Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays
tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his
dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don’t forget
Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.

—Do you mean he died so?<eos>: 74.06029932164763
Mr Best asked with slight concern.<eos>: 29.407672999714677
I mean...

—He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped.<eos>: 31.92379343032662
A quart of ale is a dish for
a king.<eos>: 65.76092508143088
O, I must tell you what Dowden said!

—What?<eos>: 23.491010398912007
asked Besteglinton.

William Shakespeare and company, limited.<eos>: 43.384646968407786
The people’s William.<eos>: 26.514265726814045
For
terms apply: E.<eos>: 38.0382789127802
Dowden, Highfield house...

—Lovely!<eos>: 43.68540176685532
Buck Mulligan suspired amorously.<eos>: 4.950453647416164
I asked him what he thought
of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard.<eos>: 57.89653150624093
He lifted his
hands and said: _All we can say is that life ran very high in those
days._ Lovely!

Catamite.

—The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to
ugling Eglinton.

Steadfast John replied severe:

—The doctor can tell us what those words mean.<eos>: 111.48511428862659
You cannot eat your cake
and have it.

Sayest thou so?<eos>: 53.206592040404146
Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?

—And the sense of property, Stephen said.<eos>: 37.59601138104345
He drew Shylock out of his
own long pocket.<eos>: 24.230174791298758
The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself
a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the
famine riots.<eos>: 15.212693991001572
His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship
mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing.
He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted
his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent.<eos>: 75.91342273623899
How else could
Aubrey’s ostler and callboy get rich quick?<eos>: 72.25059557649449
All events brought grist to
his mill.<eos>: 28.96245341910979
Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging
and quartering of the queen’s leech Lopez, his jew’s heart being
plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_
with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn
for witchroasting.<eos>: 46.053354139004156

I think you’re getting on very nicely.<eos>: 44.68484448808483
Just mix up a mixture of

_Mingo, minxi, mictum, mingere._

—Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared, expectantly.<eos>: 9.643849338104317
Your dean
of studies holds he was a holy Roman.

_Sufflaminandus sum._

—He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French
polisher of Italian scandals.

—A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded.<eos>: 44.00230709276198
Coleridge called him
myriadminded.

_Amplius.<eos>: 15.36068807763943
In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit

—Saint Thomas, Stephen began...

—_Ora pro nobis_, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.

There he keened a wailing rune.

—_Pogue mahone!<eos>: 25.379521537348673
Acushla machree!_ It’s destroyed we are from this day!
It’s destroyed we are surely!

All smiled their smiles.

—Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy
reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different
from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in
his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions.<eos>: 79.15196876783898
He means that
the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some
stranger who, it may be, hungers for it.<eos>: 97.53000509464012
Jews, whom christians tax with
avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage.<eos>: 65.1255316022438
Accusations
are made in anger.<eos>: 22.035771338093223
The christian laws which built up the hoards of the
jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their
affections too with hoops of steel.<eos>: 78.019722164728
Whether these be sins or virtues
old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet.<eos>: 51.042992544756764
But a man who holds so
tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will
hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls
his wife.<eos>: 102.57409283884803
No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his
manservant or his maidservant or his jackass.

—Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.

—Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently.

—Which will?<eos>: 82.47006795485439
gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan.<eos>: 41.20585693701876
We are getting mixed.

—The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will’s
widow, is the will to die.

_—Requiescat!_ Stephen prayed.

     What of all the will to do?
     It has vanished long ago...

—She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the
mobled queen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as
rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of
seven parishes.<eos>: 85.44682152503346
In old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed
with her at New Place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid
for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a
soul.<eos>: 139.3951766885834
She read or had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the
_Merry Wives_ and, loosing her nightly waters on the jordan, she
thought over _Hooks and Eyes for Believers’ Breeches_ and _The most
Spiritual Snuffbox to Make the Most Devout Souls Sneeze_.<eos>: 51.18612795364283
Venus has
twisted her lips in prayer.<eos>: 68.07602774106074
Agenbite of inwit: remorse of conscience.
It is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.

—History shows that to be true, _inquit Eglintonus Chronolologos_.<eos>: 56.361555968879976
The

But we have it on high authority that a man’s

I should say
that only family poets have family lives.<eos>: 158.30665847298184
Falstaff was not a family

I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation.

Mr Magee, sir, there’s a
gentleman to see you.<eos>: 16.90354062374685
Me?<eos>: 4.3998379060165895
Says he’s your father, sir.<eos>: 9.572839068356274
Give me my
Wordsworth.<eos>: 7.73842861929738
Enter Magee Mor Matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in
strossers with a buttoned codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with
clauber of ten forests, a wand of wilding in his hand.

Your own?<eos>: 35.10632037605093
He knows your old fellow.<eos>: 24.600853372836593
The widower.

Hurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside I

Dr Bob Kenny is
attending her.<eos>: 31.422613096479964
The eyes that wish me well.<eos>: 73.82726659199828
But do not know me.

—A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessary
evil.<eos>: 29.456886153291403
He wrote the play in the months that followed his father’s death.
If you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters,
with thirtyfive years of life, _nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita_,
with fifty of experience, is the beardless undergraduate from
Wittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the
lustful queen.<eos>: 52.56533026203665
No.<eos>: 5.3673087592043816
The corpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the
night.<eos>: 85.20115527846289
From hour to hour it rots and rots.<eos>: 53.20494912005977
He rests, disarmed of
fatherhood, having devised that mystical estate upon his son.
Boccaccio’s Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with
child.<eos>: 43.50288024526444
Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious begetting, is unknown to
man.<eos>: 44.55350443118379
It is a mystical estate, an apostolic succession, from only
begetter to only begotten.<eos>: 30.83997410646843
On that mystery and not on the madonna which
the cunning Italian intellect flung to the mob of Europe the church is
founded and founded irremovably because founded, like the world, macro
and microcosm, upon the void.<eos>: 83.50850921040056
Upon incertitude, upon unlikelihood.
_Amor matris_, subjective and objective genitive, may be the only true

What the hell are you driving at?

I know.<eos>: 106.10172846696011

The son

He is a new male: his growth is his father’s decline, his youth
his father’s envy, his friend his father’s enemy.

In rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it.

father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a
father be a son?<eos>: 66.96737418455358
When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another
poet of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote _Hamlet_ he was not
the father of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and
felt himself the father of all his race, the father of his own
grandfather, the father of his unborn grandson who, by the same token,
never was born, for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors
perfection.

Eglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly.<eos>: 56.09010348426954
Gladly
glancing, a merry puritan, through the twisted eglantine.

Flatter.<eos>: 33.249728414057394
Rarely.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
But flatter.

—Himself his own father, Sonmulligan told himself.<eos>: 59.5745357387701
Wait.<eos>: 2.366011761982759
I am big with
child.<eos>: 61.99677800227412
I have an unborn child in my brain.<eos>: 27.085410059992707
Pallas Athena!<eos>: 5.656895749079418
A play!<eos>: 23.80506258138448
The
play’s the thing!<eos>: 35.25531046682707
Let me parturiate!

He clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.

—As for his family, Stephen said, his mother’s name lives in the forest
of Arden.<eos>: 29.850453435450905
Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia in
_Coriolanus._ His boyson’s death is the deathscene of young Arthur in
_King John._ Hamlet, the black prince, is Hamnet Shakespeare.<eos>: 65.63410343981924
Who the
girls in _The Tempest_, in _Pericles,_ in _Winter’s Tale_ are we know.
Who Cleopatra, fleshpot of Egypt, and Cressid and Venus are we may
guess.<eos>: 37.76350250819585
But there is another member of his family who is recorded.

—The plot thickens, John Eglinton said.

The quaker librarian, quaking, tiptoed in, quake, his mask, quake, with
haste, quake, quack.

Door closed.<eos>: 21.99750955610768
Cell.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Day.

They list.<eos>: 17.692165197582806
Three.<eos>: 11.474489421768137
They.

I you he they.

Come, mess.

STEPHEN: He had three brothers, Gilbert, Edmund, Richard.<eos>: 98.53677611680632
Gilbert in
his old age told some cavaliers he got a pass for nowt from Maister
Gatherer one time mass he did and he seen his brud Maister Wull the
playwriter up in Lunnon in a wrastling play wud a man on’s back.<eos>: 64.96873168110763
The
playhouse sausage filled Gilbert’s soul.<eos>: 19.272134052398744
He is nowhere: but an Edmund
and a Richard are recorded in the works of sweet William.

MAGEEGLINJOHN: Names!<eos>: 149.6712630095598
What’s in a name?

BEST: That is my name, Richard, don’t you know.<eos>: 19.73850284136716
I hope you are going to
say a good word for Richard, don’t you know, for my sake.<eos>: 21.560221821503013
_(Laughter)_

BUCKMULLIGAN: (_Piano, diminuendo_)

     Then outspoke medical Dick
     To his comrade medical Davy...

STEPHEN: In his trinity of black Wills, the villain shakebags, Iago,
Richard Crookback, Edmund in _King Lear_, two bear the wicked uncles’
names.<eos>: 57.23866061282605
Nay, that last play was written or being written while his
brother Edmund lay dying in Southwark.

BEST: I hope Edmund is going to catch it.<eos>: 139.7193759639399
I don’t want Richard, my name
...

_(Laughter)_

QUAKERLYSTER: (_A tempo_) But he that filches from me my good name...

STEPHEN: _(Stringendo)_ He has hidden his own name, a fair name,
William, in the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old
Italy set his face in a dark corner of his canvas.<eos>: 56.67933333806044
He has revealed it
in the sonnets where there is Will in overplus.<eos>: 49.61597058833094
Like John o’Gaunt his
name is dear to him, as dear as the coat and crest he toadied for, on a
bend sable a spear or steeled argent, honorificabilitudinitatibus,
dearer than his glory of greatest shakescene in the country.<eos>: 70.23268117569641
What’s in
a name?<eos>: 11.015988555527732
That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the
name that we are told is ours.<eos>: 122.72982416283398
A star, a daystar, a firedrake, rose at
his birth.<eos>: 21.802870016461096
It shone by day in the heavens alone, brighter than Venus in
the night, and by night it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, the
recumbent constellation which is the signature of his initial among the
stars.<eos>: 88.04409120162397
His eyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the
bear, as he walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight
returning from Shottery and from her arms.

Both satisfied.<eos>: 50.212737788543585
I too.

Don’t tell them he was nine years old when it was quenched.

And from her arms.

Wait to be wooed and won.<eos>: 49.63255940850762
Ay, meacock.<eos>: 5.4629518365343746
Who will woo you?

—What is that, Mr Dedalus?<eos>: 19.04357244478841
the quaker librarian asked.<eos>: 17.22572176148201
Was it a
celestial phenomenon?

—A star by night, Stephen said.<eos>: 42.82019997410121
A pillar of the cloud by day.

What more’s to speak?

Stephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.

_Stephanos,_ my crown.<eos>: 47.94729051899345
My sword.<eos>: 14.574262847617433
His boots are spoiling the shape of my
feet.<eos>: 23.98125315301277
Buy a pair.<eos>: 12.276969924258605
Holes in my socks.<eos>: 27.24378509388057
Handkerchief too.

—You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed.<eos>: 41.34395817222971
Your own name is
strange enough.<eos>: 38.34647674330219
I suppose it explains your fantastical humour.

Me, Magee and Mulligan.

Fabulous artificer.<eos>: 31.014518939422985
The hawklike man.<eos>: 6.956084717783591
You flew.<eos>: 8.371787644286666
Whereto?
Newhaven-Dieppe, steerage passenger.<eos>: 8.71908480111157
Paris and back.<eos>: 18.725043109901
Lapwing.<eos>: 1.9031205314551483
Icarus.
_Pater, ait._ Seabedabbled, fallen, weltering.<eos>: 9.719071962455569
Lapwing you are.<eos>: 10.757135949083919
Lapwing
be.

Mr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say:

—That’s very interesting because that brother motive, don’t you know,
we find also in the old Irish myths.<eos>: 42.19607835075978
Just what you say.<eos>: 18.956537226257822
The three
brothers Shakespeare.<eos>: 79.29066997032804
In Grimm too, don’t you know, the fairytales.<eos>: 9.589906854311687
The
third brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best
prize.

Best of Best brothers.<eos>: 154.3186795084838
Good, better, best.

The quaker librarian springhalted near.

—I should like to know, he said, which brother you...<eos>: 57.30156729574768
I understand you
to suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers...<eos>: 68.51646291399344
But perhaps
I am anticipating?

He caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.

An attendant from the doorway called:

—Mr Lyster!<eos>: 69.56702535285527
Father Dineen wants...

—O, Father Dineen!<eos>: 34.88304714738318
Directly.

Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.

John Eglinton touched the foil.

—Come, he said.<eos>: 26.200740106071287
Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and Edmund.
You kept them for the last, didn’t you?

—In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie and
nuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps.<eos>: 80.42168013072022
A
brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.

Lapwing.

Where is your brother?<eos>: 130.77669635679828
Apothecaries’ hall.<eos>: 13.041540009814055

Be acted on.

Lapwing.

I am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau.<eos>: 33.787408239971796
My kingdom for a drink.

On.

—You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he
took the stuff of his plays.<eos>: 68.62771797432815
Why did he take them rather than others?
Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann
(what’s in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow.<eos>: 54.28681824519955
Richard
the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered.<eos>: 54.201210028549895
The
other four acts of that play hang limply from that first.<eos>: 112.77981010419461
Of all his
kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare’s reverence,
the angel of the world.<eos>: 43.311034829099505
Why is the underplot of _King Lear_ in which
Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney’s _Arcadia_ and spatchcocked on to
a Celtic legend older than history?

—That was Will’s way, John Eglinton defended.<eos>: 50.00076718297629
We should not now combine
a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith.<eos>: 27.956549718756115
_Que
voulez-vous?_ Moore would say.<eos>: 85.83520622007606
He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and
makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.

—Why?<eos>: 34.526901142335426
Stephen answered himself.<eos>: 19.586918265311425
Because the theme of the false or the
usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to
Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him.<eos>: 60.05371131061082
The note of
banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds
uninterruptedly from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ onward till Prospero
breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his
book.<eos>: 47.53200358650511
It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in
another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.
It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married
daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery.<eos>: 45.7394235067021
But it
was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will
and left in him a strong inclination to evil.<eos>: 88.32085448206617
The words are those of my
lords bishops of Maynooth.<eos>: 46.59790002097704
An original sin and, like original sin,
committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned.<eos>: 263.9143576286785
It is between the
lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under
which her four bones are not to be laid.<eos>: 71.0012733781789
Age has not withered it.
Beauty and peace have not done it away.<eos>: 66.26820620414892
It is in infinite variety
everywhere in the world he has created, in _Much Ado about Nothing_,
twice in _As you like It_, in _The Tempest_, in _Hamlet,_ in _Measure
for Measure_—and in all the other plays which I have not read.

He laughed to free his mind from his mind’s bondage.

Judge Eglinton summed up.

—The truth is midway, he affirmed.<eos>: 59.539251417884245
He is the ghost and the prince.<eos>: 21.24134522783559
He
is all in all.

—He is, Stephen said.<eos>: 13.88132328149457
The boy of act one is the mature man of act five.
All in all.<eos>: 137.8119938274905
In _Cymbeline,_ in _Othello_ he is bawd and cuckold.<eos>: 20.70681911710972
He
acts and is acted on.<eos>: 32.66160546436955
Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like José he
kills the real Carmen.<eos>: 50.216005755532976
His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago
ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.

—Cuckoo!<eos>: 49.14662509660538
Cuckoo!<eos>: 7.06469885969485
Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly.<eos>: 11.996801609539688
O word of fear!

Dark dome received, reverbed.

—And what a character is Iago!<eos>: 69.25695558578845
undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed.<eos>: 27.282232633854687
When
all is said Dumas _fils_ (or is it Dumas _père?)_ is right.<eos>: 106.57308325462529
After God
Shakespeare has created most.

—Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said.<eos>: 140.55958007710444
He returns after
a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has
always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of
life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth.<eos>: 122.90866772319269
Then dies.<eos>: 14.975958832105592
The
motion is ended.<eos>: 37.20483428433879
Gravediggers bury Hamlet _père_ and Hamlet _fils._ A
king and a prince at last in death, with incidental music.<eos>: 62.761518896088894
And, what
though murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for,
Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom
they refuse to be divorced.<eos>: 71.6109996503594
If you like the epilogue look long on it:
prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa’s lump of
love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the
place where the bad niggers go.<eos>: 50.240299821934954
Strong curtain.<eos>: 16.16394413492092
He found in the world
without as actual what was in his world within as possible.<eos>: 107.4035402480248
Maeterlinck
says: _If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated
on his doorstep.<eos>: 127.74294510332562
If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps
will tend._ Every life is many days, day after day.<eos>: 160.0979390361242
We walk through
ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives,
widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves.<eos>: 149.33129582237825
The playwright
who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light
first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom
the most Roman of catholics call _dio boia_, hangman god, is doubtless
all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and
cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet,
there are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being
a wife unto himself.

_—Eureka!_ Buck Mulligan cried.<eos>: 66.2356349826626
_Eureka!_

Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton’s
desk.

—May I?<eos>: 48.48935640972102
he said.<eos>: 3.492439908750907
The Lord has spoken to Malachi.

He began to scribble on a slip of paper.

Take some slips from the counter going out.

—Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one,
shall live.<eos>: 89.59028228018863
The rest shall keep as they are.

He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.

Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his
variorum edition of _The Taming of the Shrew._

—You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen.<eos>: 50.59545029634416
You have
brought us all this way to show us a French triangle.<eos>: 43.406075891718736
Do you believe
your own theory?

—No, Stephen said promptly.

—Are you going to write it?<eos>: 19.27836941267411
Mr Best asked.<eos>: 10.091543230130958
You ought to make it a
dialogue, don’t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.

John Eclecticon doubly smiled.

—Well, in that case, he said, I don’t see why you should expect payment
for it since you don’t believe it yourself.<eos>: 31.346763753281525
Dowden believes there is
some mystery in _Hamlet_ but will say no more.<eos>: 136.70466074287853
Herr Bleibtreu, the man
Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes
that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument.<eos>: 94.2480030725697
He is going to
visit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor
wrote the plays.<eos>: 116.5978261489302
It will come as a surprise to his grace.<eos>: 34.670463221368905
But he
believes his theory.

I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief.<eos>: 62.14896125436427
That is, help me to believe or
help me to unbelieve?<eos>: 35.22576993845212
Who helps to believe?<eos>: 20.099443520512406
_Egomen._ Who to unbelieve?
Other chap.

—You are the only contributor to _Dana_ who asks for pieces of silver.
Then I don’t know about the next number.<eos>: 58.520614970432796
Fred Ryan wants space for an
article on economics.

Tide you over.<eos>: 51.39682189544927
Economics.

—For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.

Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then
gravely said, honeying malice:

—I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper
Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the _Summa
contra Gentiles_ in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly
and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.

He broke away.

—Come, Kinch.<eos>: 44.106355369230876
Come, wandering Ængus of the birds.

Come, Kinch.<eos>: 30.268967661809526
You have eaten all we left.<eos>: 51.06928868955935
Ay.<eos>: 2.4577195247332724
I will serve you your orts
and offals.

Stephen rose.

Life is many days.<eos>: 52.55200222140178
This will end.

—We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said.<eos>: 24.957201439126734
_Notre ami_ Moore says
Malachi Mulligan must be there.

Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.

—Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of
Ireland.<eos>: 54.524960674343134
I’ll be there.<eos>: 6.634466984636183
Come, Kinch, the bards must drink.<eos>: 20.27552041602199
Can you walk
straight?

Laughing, he...

Swill till eleven.<eos>: 85.08548683955097
Irish nights entertainment.

Lubber...

Stephen followed a lubber...

One day in the national library we had a discussion.<eos>: 86.96372946318199

After.<eos>: 5.34801119097268
His
lub back: I followed.<eos>: 45.212704546235436
I gall his kibe.

Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a
wellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering
daylight of no thought.

What have I learned?<eos>: 33.52991258831823
Of them?<eos>: 10.35002983971006
Of me?

Walk like Haines now.

—O please do, sir...<eos>: 27.323669369577647
I shall be most pleased...

Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself,
selfnodding:

—A pleased bottom.

The turnstile.

Is that?...<eos>: 85.39200110272677
Blueribboned hat...<eos>: 39.58684859148321

Looked?...

The curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius.

Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling:

     John Eglinton, my jo, John,
     Why won’t you wed a wife?

He spluttered to the air:

—O, the chinless Chinaman!<eos>: 28.507135557130148

—Longworth and M’Curdy Atkinson were there...

Puck Mulligan footed featly, trilling:

     I hardly hear the purlieu cry
     Or a Tommy talk as I pass one by
     Before my thoughts begin to run
     On F.<eos>: 108.72189192851887
M’Curdy Atkinson,
     The same that had the wooden leg
     And that filibustering filibeg
     That never dared to slake his drouth,
     Magee that had the chinless mouth.
     Being afraid to marry on earth
     They masturbated for all they were worth.

Jest on.<eos>: 83.38893537743854
Know thyself.

Halted, below me, a quizzer looks at me.<eos>: 40.23215088473665
I halt.

—Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned.<eos>: 29.687765656201897
Synge has left off wearing
black to be like nature.<eos>: 119.76675986130901
Only crows, priests and English coal are
black.

A laugh tripped over his lips.

—Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that
old hake Gregory.<eos>: 58.871498451537235
O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit!<eos>: 28.009989669060396
She gets you a
job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus.
Couldn’t you do the Yeats touch?

He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms:

—The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time.
One thinks of Homer.

He stopped at the stairfoot.

—I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly.

The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined.<eos>: 40.68366712194115
Gone the nine men’s
morrice with caps of indices.

In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet:

_Everyman His Own Wife
or
A Honeymoon in the Hand
(a national immorality in three orgasms)
by
Ballocky Mulligan._


He turned a happy patch’s smirk to Stephen, saying:

—The disguise, I fear, is thin.<eos>: 56.72587487905635
But listen.

He read, _marcato:_

—Characters:

     TOBY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole)
     CRAB (a bushranger)
     MEDICAL DICK )
         and      ) (two birds with one stone)
     MEDICAL DAVY )
     MOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier)
     FRESH NELLY
         and
     ROSALIE (the coalquay whore).

He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen:
and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:

—O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift
their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured,
multicoloured, multitudinous vomit!

—The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted
them.

About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.

Part.<eos>: 91.10219871708465
The moment is now.<eos>: 19.41320971371873
Where then?<eos>: 11.034425651313406
If Socrates leave his house today,
if Judas go forth tonight.<eos>: 94.96952337414751
Why?<eos>: 4.396144867849921
That lies in space which I in time must
come to, ineluctably.

My will: his will that fronts me.<eos>: 115.90409392732879
Seas between.

A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.

—Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.

The portico.

Here I watched the birds for augury.<eos>: 44.83697072735898
Ængus of the birds.<eos>: 11.202365259832913

—The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown’s awe.<eos>: 37.659217096871565
Did you
see his eye?<eos>: 14.824780904575302
He looked upon you to lust after you.<eos>: 57.241279334367526
I fear thee, ancient

O, Kinch, thou art in peril.<eos>: 32.16337063336979

Day.<eos>: 41.230190579389856
Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.

A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway,
under portcullis barbs.

They followed.

Offend me still.<eos>: 73.27910244807921
Speak on.

Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street.<eos>: 40.21134142809913
No birds.
Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in
a flaw of softness softly were blown.

Cease to strive.<eos>: 30.17740031672992
Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic:

The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.<eos>: 90.01172224192317
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
reset his smooth
watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps.<eos>: 34.18402660761861
Five
to three.<eos>: 75.34790257112175
Just nice time to walk to Artane.<eos>: 22.08798637015443
What was that boy’s name
again?<eos>: 19.19863223717112
Dignam.<eos>: 2.2640317304767894
Yes.<eos>: 2.0880743848448278
_Vere dignum et iustum est._ Brother Swan was the
person to see.<eos>: 39.321857180896686
Mr Cunningham’s letter.<eos>: 14.416437097851102
Yes.<eos>: 2.0880743848448278
Oblige him, if possible.
Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.

A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his
crutches, growled some notes.<eos>: 105.60765161337336
He jerked short before the convent of the
sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very
reverend John Conmee S.<eos>: 48.19421685783147
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his
purse held, he knew, one silver crown.

Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square.<eos>: 90.98731595624524
He thought, but not for long,
of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs,
ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey’s words:
_If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have
abandoned me in my old days._ He walked by the treeshade of
sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy
M.P.

—Very well, indeed, father.<eos>: 79.56735030896608
And you, father?

Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed.<eos>: 38.56838715234984
He would go to Buxton
probably for the waters.<eos>: 27.250507211207232
And her boys, were they getting on well at
Belvedere?<eos>: 125.60708224698061
Was that so?<eos>: 15.207222466907522
Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear
that.<eos>: 48.338798341281255
And Mr Sheehy himself?<eos>: 41.18871720062908
Still in London.<eos>: 19.88039893516846
The house was still
sitting, to be sure it was.<eos>: 51.267035273817356
Beautiful weather it was, delightful
indeed.<eos>: 86.9767656704792
Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would
come again to preach.<eos>: 32.41295731076753
O, yes: a very great success.<eos>: 32.35763897056341
A wonderful man
really.

Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.
Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P.
Yes, he would certainly call.

—Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.

Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the
jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun.<eos>: 51.461703862541235
And smiled yet again,
in going.<eos>: 109.2628587601038
He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.

Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father
Bernard Vaughan’s droll eyes and cockney voice.

—Pilate!<eos>: 34.57342896367632
Wy don’t you old back that owlin mob?

A zealous man, however.<eos>: 58.95475463651879
Really he was.<eos>: 15.093398020532112
And really did great good in his
way.<eos>: 84.697453073443
Beyond a doubt.<eos>: 9.975166056687366
He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.
Of good family too would one think it?<eos>: 86.47741803739937
Welsh, were they not?

O, lest he forget.<eos>: 54.41074415943448
That letter to father provincial.

Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy
square.<eos>: 85.68730195825076
Yes: they were from Belvedere.<eos>: 27.514613484970873
The little house.<eos>: 14.162793677673514
Aha.<eos>: 2.202974016859207
And were
they good boys at school?<eos>: 116.25987762922568
O.<eos>: 2.146866114935731
That was very good now.<eos>: 17.32821799124904
And what was his
name?<eos>: 15.313390062964636
Jack Sohan.<eos>: 4.148438859307231
And his name?<eos>: 15.096792551260844
Ger.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Gallaher.<eos>: 4.4915316523051265
And the other little
man?<eos>: 28.921440902886854
His name was Brunny Lynam.<eos>: 10.868782694885736
O, that was a very nice name to have.

Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and
pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.

—But mind you don’t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.

The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:

—O, sir.

—Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.

Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee’s letter
to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox.<eos>: 46.09515093438474
Father
Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square
east.

Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate
frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender
trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave
deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady
Maxwell at the corner of Dignam’s court.

Was that not Mrs M’Guinness?

Mrs M’Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the
farther footpath along which she sailed.<eos>: 96.28985134966528
And Father Conmee smiled and
saluted.<eos>: 42.38173591049432
How did she do?

A fine carriage she had.<eos>: 57.23664396046624
Like Mary, queen of Scots, something.<eos>: 35.1391626555136
And to
think that she was a pawnbroker!<eos>: 26.752825547581647
Well, now!<eos>: 13.286365987147178
Such a...<eos>: 27.84440096600845
what should he
say?...<eos>: 26.731847661528484
such a queenly mien.

Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the
shutup free church on his left.<eos>: 78.36911822778319
The reverend T.<eos>: 26.949726794008967
R.<eos>: 1.411571236231163
Greene B.A.<eos>: 34.785350056552524
will
(D.V.) speak.<eos>: 277.79375512916573
The incumbent they called him.<eos>: 13.902702973342924
He felt it incumbent on
him to say a few words.<eos>: 26.56178489778848
But one should be charitable.<eos>: 15.771261725202443
Invincible
ignorance.<eos>: 2.332233111446509
They acted according to their lights.

Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular
road.<eos>: 36.361934812405174
It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an
important thoroughfare.<eos>: 66.0179448177568
Surely, there ought to be.

A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street.<eos>: 48.560970366853304
All
raised untidy caps.<eos>: 35.060183826994965
Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.
Christian brother boys.

Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked.<eos>: 96.33010256436107
Saint
Joseph’s church, Portland row.<eos>: 17.45482496479158
For aged and virtuous females.<eos>: 54.59077906878226
Father
Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament.<eos>: 28.13484197923372
Virtuous: but
occasionally they were also badtempered.

Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift
nobleman.<eos>: 80.16723223920432
And now it was an office or something.

Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted
by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop.<eos>: 60.994025763871065
Father
Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came
from baconflitches and ample cools of butter.<eos>: 58.77761453049538
He passed Grogan’s the
Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful
catastrophe in New York.<eos>: 113.63825946039586
In America those things were continually
happening.<eos>: 47.626358887107536
Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared.<eos>: 32.943264058680946
Still, an
act of perfect contrition.

Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin’s publichouse against the window of
which two unlabouring men lounged.<eos>: 33.269736653288206
They saluted him and were saluted.

Father Conmee passed H.<eos>: 55.688947577307296
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Neill’s funeral establishment where Corny
Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.
A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted
the constable.<eos>: 61.643682807669094
In Youkstetter’s, the porkbutcher’s, Father Conmee
observed pig’s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in
tubes.

Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a
turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty
straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above
him.<eos>: 40.60748214687684
It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of
the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out
and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor
people.

On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.<eos>: 68.51950210267152
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
of saint Francis
Xavier’s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound
tram.

Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C.<eos>: 109.36339702798224
C.<eos>: 3.246585668467089
of
saint Agatha’s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.

At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for
he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.

Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with
care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a
sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into
his purse.<eos>: 88.9327428024773
Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket
inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away
the ticket.<eos>: 132.31529140748756
The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father
Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap.<eos>: 30.06551433411157
Father Conmee liked
cheerful decorum.

It was a peaceful day.<eos>: 34.86749593506713
The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father
Conmee had finished explaining and looked down.<eos>: 107.83817855664527
His wife, Father Conmee
supposed.<eos>: 36.793237913757466
A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman
with the glasses.<eos>: 45.44999417407254
She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so
gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and
smiled tinily, sweetly.

Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car.<eos>: 78.71448154996531
He perceived also that
the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the
seat.

Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the
mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.

At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old
woman rose suddenly from her place to alight.<eos>: 78.4575744012394
The conductor pulled the
bellstrap to stay the car for her.<eos>: 67.68176230069975
She passed out with her basket and a
marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and
basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed
the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had
always to be told twice _bless you, my child,_ that they have been
absolved, _pray for me._ But they had so many worries in life, so many
cares, poor creatures.

From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at
Father Conmee.

Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men
and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.<eos>: 75.81998086260056
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
and the African mission
and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and
brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when
their last hour came like a thief in the night.<eos>: 60.69274043617364
That book by the
Belgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des Élus,_ seemed to Father Conmee a
reasonable plea.<eos>: 26.057145540072987
Those were millions of human souls created by God in
His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D.V.) been brought.<eos>: 243.8842423916629
But
they were God’s souls, created by God.<eos>: 51.264440299661544
It seemed to Father Conmee a
pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.

At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the
conductor and saluted in his turn.

The Malahide road was quiet.<eos>: 120.79167684201096
It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.
The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide.<eos>: 144.38732181756905
Lord Talbot de Malahide,
immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.
Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.
Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old
times in the barony.

Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the
Barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and
of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of
Belvedere.

A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel,
Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening,
not startled when an otter plunged.<eos>: 90.87874041653474
Who could know the truth?<eos>: 25.43620522447846
Not the
jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed
adultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris,_ with
her husband’s brother?<eos>: 54.686429118361744
She would half confess if she had not all sinned
as women did.<eos>: 62.893891101541506
Only God knew and she and he, her husband’s brother.

Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however
for man’s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our
ways.

Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore.<eos>: 81.27734182684095
He was humane and
honoured there.<eos>: 18.734040698415203
He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at
smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit
clusters.<eos>: 110.91813641390831
And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble,
were impalmed by Don John Conmee.

It was a charming day.

The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages,
curtseying to him with ample underleaves.<eos>: 57.38286322732581
The sky showed him a flock of
small white clouds going slowly down the wind.<eos>: 95.9910741489553
_Moutonner,_ the French
said.<eos>: 20.238505157286454
A just and homely word.

Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds
over Rathcoffey.<eos>: 50.22635540964716
His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of
Clongowes field.<eos>: 27.44192079517392
He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the
cries of the boys’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet
evening.<eos>: 85.52120220340773
He was their rector: his reign was mild.

Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out.
An ivory bookmark told him the page.

Nones.<eos>: 54.10015901986818
He should have read that before lunch.<eos>: 67.85467133465421
But lady Maxwell had
come.

Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast.
_Deus in adiutorium._

He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he
came to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas:
in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ._

A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a
young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand.<eos>: 42.98908329003958
The young man raised
his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care
detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.

Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his
breviary.<eos>: 103.45330324647695

Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping
eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner.<eos>: 20.832545368014774
He pulled himself erect,
went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass
furnishings.<eos>: 56.68493212696399
Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came
to the doorway.<eos>: 39.391554764557505
There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes
and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.

Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.

Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat
downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.

Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.

—That’s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.

—Ay, Corny Kelleher said.

—It’s very close, the constable said.

Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth
while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a
coin.

—What’s the best news?<eos>: 40.03742231936291
he asked.

—I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with
bated breath.

A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell’s corner, skirting
Rabaiotti’s icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street.<eos>: 38.482162557665866
Towards
Larry O’Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:

—_For England_...

He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted
and growled:

—_home and beauty._

J.<eos>: 48.35866893866965
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy’s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in
the warehouse with a visitor.

A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it
into the cap held out to her.<eos>: 51.91562485704961
The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced
sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself
forward four strides.

He halted and growled angrily:

—_For England_...

Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him,
gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.

He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head
towards a window and bayed deeply:

—_home and beauty._

The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.
The blind of the window was drawn aside.<eos>: 73.48788194887376
A card _Unfurnished
Apartments_ slipped from the sash and fell.<eos>: 30.893862177215308
A plump bare generous arm
shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut
shiftstraps.<eos>: 54.01081170800384
A woman’s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings.
It fell on the path.

One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the
minstrel’s cap, saying:

—There, sir.

*    *    *


Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming
kitchen.

—Did you put in the books?<eos>: 35.98452056759333
Boody asked.

Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds
twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.

—They wouldn’t give anything on them, she said.

Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles
tickled by stubble.

—Where did you try?<eos>: 40.75153411921613
Boody asked.

—M’Guinness’s.

Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.

—Bad cess to her big face!<eos>: 62.412387590323256
she cried.

Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.

—What’s in the pot?<eos>: 25.039535580612252
she asked.

—Shirts, Maggy said.

Boody cried angrily:

—Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?

Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:

—And what’s in this?

A heavy fume gushed in answer.

—Peasoup, Maggy said.

—Where did you get it?<eos>: 37.09765443747331
Katey asked.

—Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.

The lacquey rang his bell.

—Barang!

Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily:

—Give us it here.

Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl.<eos>: 64.17421376799422
Katey,
sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her
mouth random crumbs:

—A good job we have that much.<eos>: 80.08581919258083
Where’s Dilly?

—Gone to meet father, Maggy said.

Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:

—Our father who art not in heaven.

Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey’s bowl, exclaimed:

—Boody!<eos>: 99.6245502711109
For shame!

A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the
Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed
around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains,
between the Customhouse old dock and George’s quay.

The blond girl in Thornton’s bedded the wicker basket with rustling
fibre.<eos>: 50.97573494882635
Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper
and a small jar.

—Put these in first, will you?<eos>: 89.55461101542151
he said.

—Yes, sir, the blond girl said.<eos>: 10.197370885773989
And the fruit on top.

—That’ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.

She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe
shamefaced peaches.

Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the
fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red
tomatoes, sniffing smells.

H.<eos>: 106.61428660179692

Y.’S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane,
plodding towards their goal.

He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from
his fob and held it at its chain’s length.

—Can you send them by tram?<eos>: 46.04896442214496
Now?

A darkbacked figure under Merchants’ arch scanned books on the hawker’s
cart.

—Certainly, sir.<eos>: 28.1961229060884
Is it in the city?

—O, yes, Blazes Boylan said.<eos>: 12.635321958799073
Ten minutes.

The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.

—Will you write the address, sir?

Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.

—Send it at once, will you?<eos>: 52.93771988981841
he said.<eos>: 3.492439908750907
It’s for an invalid.

—Yes, sir.<eos>: 9.15571508329797
I will, sir.

Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers’ pocket.

—What’s the damage?<eos>: 29.933279020059544
he asked.

The blond girl’s slim fingers reckoned the fruits.

Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse.<eos>: 42.913153636124704
A young pullet.<eos>: 9.649541123425701
He
took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.

—This for me?<eos>: 24.515057091935816
he asked gallantly.

The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie
a bit crooked, blushing.

—Yes, sir, she said.

Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.

Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the
red flower between his smiling teeth.

—May I say a word to your telephone, missy?<eos>: 57.98524920457665
he asked roguishly.

_—Ma!_ Almidano Artifoni said.

He gazed over Stephen’s shoulder at Goldsmith’s knobby poll.

Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore,
gripping the handrests.<eos>: 33.858554895304025
Palefaces.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Men’s arms frankly round their
stunted forms.<eos>: 38.33079700859991
They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of
the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.

—_Anch’io ho avuto di queste idee_, Almidano Artifoni said, _quand’ ero
giovine come Lei.<eos>: 39.32493771232917
Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia.<eos>: 5.956658199710737
È
peccato.<eos>: 2.842387380473868
Perchè la sua voce...<eos>: 18.187789064247703
sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via.
Invece, Lei si sacrifica._

—_Sacrifizio incruento,_ Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in
slow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly.

_—Speriamo,_ the round mustachioed face said pleasantly.<eos>: 27.666486405024934
_Ma, dia retta
a me.<eos>: 24.067143864556513
Ci rifletta_.

By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram
unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.

—_Ci rifletterò,_ Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.

—_Ma, sul serio, eh?_ Almidano Artifoni said.

His heavy hand took Stephen’s firmly.<eos>: 36.961381687162735
Human eyes.<eos>: 10.478980290702538
They gazed curiously
an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.

_—Eccolo,_ Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste.<eos>: 51.910264913293055
_Venga a trovarmi
e ci pensi.<eos>: 36.68555267740908
Addio, caro._

—_Arrivederla, maestro,_ Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand
was freed.<eos>: 16.426238112800483
_E grazie._

—_Di che?_ Almidano Artifoni said.<eos>: 10.02877738723158
_Scusi, eh?<eos>: 9.881490272746777
Tante belle cose!_

Almidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal,
trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram.<eos>: 101.73536976455495
In vain he trotted,
signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling
implements of music through Trinity gates.

Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of _The Woman in White_
far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her
typewriter.

Too much mystery business in it.<eos>: 92.89287086398802
Is he in love with that one, Marion?
Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.

The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them:
six.

Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:

—16 June 1904.

Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny’s corner and the slab
where Wolfe Tone’s statue was not, eeled themselves turning H.<eos>: 68.8123543990863
E.<eos>: 1.5381861561152315
L.
Y.’S and plodded back as they had come.

Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming
soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens
and capital esses.<eos>: 42.134745398406594
Mustard hair and dauby cheeks.<eos>: 21.54651751859401
She’s not
nicelooking, is she?<eos>: 14.73417773713953
The way she’s holding up her bit of a skirt.
Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight.<eos>: 88.87352636401313
If I could get that
dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle’s.<eos>: 24.215750489707418
They kick out
grand.<eos>: 50.133349304506346
Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her.
Hope to goodness he won’t keep me here till seven.

The telephone rang rudely by her ear.

—Hello.<eos>: 64.59143216416412
Yes, sir.<eos>: 5.073569478673312
No, sir.<eos>: 8.741513829040036
Yes, sir.<eos>: 5.073569478673312
I’ll ring them up after five.<eos>: 26.266462300877333
Only
those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool.<eos>: 57.06792035472288
All right, sir.<eos>: 12.300298953717437
Then I can
go after six if you’re not back.<eos>: 52.11107610418151
A quarter after.<eos>: 31.996219400159706
Yes, sir.<eos>: 5.073569478673312
Twentyseven
and six.<eos>: 14.582338376424085
I’ll tell him.<eos>: 4.824756847361944
Yes: one, seven, six.

She scribbled three figures on an envelope.

—Mr Boylan!<eos>: 62.20566769731728
Hello!<eos>: 14.7619675443677
That gentleman from _Sport_ was in looking for you.
Mr Lenehan, yes.<eos>: 74.68071343484185
He said he’ll be in the Ormond at four.<eos>: 28.858032894851565
No, sir.<eos>: 8.741513829040036
Yes,
sir.<eos>: 5.073569478673312
I’ll ring them up after five.

Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.

—Who’s that?<eos>: 24.718880723835642
Ned Lambert asked.<eos>: 14.222120122777602
Is that Crotty?

—Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.

—Hello, Jack, is that yourself?<eos>: 22.580854123750793
Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his
pliant lath among the flickering arches.<eos>: 32.29683356369312
Come on.<eos>: 7.061696993660674
Mind your steps
there.

The vesta in the clergyman’s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long
soft flame and was let fall.<eos>: 83.61565080651596
At their feet its red speck died: and
mouldy air closed round them.

—How interesting!<eos>: 128.50180062334292
a refined accent said in the gloom.

—Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily.<eos>: 13.692704536896894
We are standing in the historic
council chamber of saint Mary’s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed
himself a rebel in 1534.<eos>: 73.05205964215192
This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.
O’Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days.
The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and
the original jews’ temple was here too before they built their
synagogue over in Adelaide road.<eos>: 69.23490742427073
You were never here before, Jack, were
you?

—No, Ned.

—He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory
serves me.<eos>: 62.12894820998205
The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.

—That’s right, Ned Lambert said.<eos>: 14.297324437485146
That’s quite right, sir.

—If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to
allow me perhaps...

—Certainly, Ned Lambert said.<eos>: 30.39993168571274
Bring the camera whenever you like.<eos>: 19.712030926271986
I’ll
get those bags cleared away from the windows.<eos>: 31.997355948465376
You can take it from here
or from here.

In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the
piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.

From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.

—I’m deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said.<eos>: 56.5366398699786
I won’t trespass
on your valuable time...

—You’re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said.<eos>: 15.12589710540791
Drop in whenever you like.<eos>: 31.2455454416803
Next
week, say.<eos>: 27.824472317616557
Can you see?

—Yes, yes.<eos>: 9.366263450343942
Good afternoon, Mr Lambert.<eos>: 38.99709522356954
Very pleased to have met you.

—Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.

He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away
among the pillars.<eos>: 35.26078288569327
With J.<eos>: 5.675398536521273
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary’s
abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut
meal, O’Connor, Wexford.

He stood to read the card in his hand.

—The reverend Hugh C.<eos>: 36.44327575718001
Love, Rathcoffey.<eos>: 3.4251507224303013
Present address: Saint
Michael’s, Sallins.<eos>: 31.763521019962262
Nice young chap he is.<eos>: 23.416013073523324
He’s writing a book about
the Fitzgeralds he told me.<eos>: 20.904437861109443
He’s well up in history, faith.

The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging
twig.

—I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J.<eos>: 52.47460300773031
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy said.

Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.

—God!<eos>: 14.953902168539836
he cried.<eos>: 5.5071354960858985
I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare
after he set fire to Cashel cathedral.<eos>: 79.85413134936388
You know that one?<eos>: 21.19337021251479
_I’m bloody
sorry I did it,_ says he, _but I declare to God I thought the
archbishop was inside._ He mightn’t like it, though.<eos>: 42.832701603766665
What?<eos>: 3.8546952873351206
God, I’ll
tell him anyhow.<eos>: 9.50828550653451
That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor.<eos>: 32.12521412775832
Hot
members they were all of them, the Geraldines.

The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness.<eos>: 104.10627779311136
He
slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:

—Woa, sonny!

He turned to J.<eos>: 19.028575998043564
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy and asked:

—Well, Jack.<eos>: 17.954924287500937
What is it?<eos>: 5.242979352456067
What’s the trouble?<eos>: 10.83873685801976
Wait awhile.<eos>: 8.556431956109677
Hold hard.

With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an
instant, sneezed loudly.

—Chow!<eos>: 70.8340702899953
he said.<eos>: 3.492439908750907
Blast you!

—The dust from those sacks, J.<eos>: 33.086082182520165
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
O’Molloy said politely.

—No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a...<eos>: 14.93421355713266
cold night before...<eos>: 69.95735868382651
blast your
soul...<eos>: 20.13064787052502
night before last...<eos>: 63.2518325133771
and there was a hell of a lot of
draught...

He held his handkerchief ready for the coming...

—I was...<eos>: 72.92339341500731
Glasnevin this morning...<eos>: 36.4622411807824
poor little...<eos>: 16.68870783482427
what do you call
him...<eos>: 15.628772833861456
Chow!...<eos>: 34.94290305019747
Mother of Moses!

Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his
claret waistcoat.

—See?<eos>: 46.527986876986155
he said.<eos>: 3.492439908750907
Say it’s turn six.<eos>: 21.88080750759536
In here, see.<eos>: 21.076906396826775
Turn Now On.

He slid it into the left slot for them.<eos>: 28.34036308120441
It shot down the groove,
wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.

Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the
consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying
the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the
admiralty division of king’s bench to the court of appeal an elderly
female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of
great amplitude.

—See?<eos>: 72.62792469044129
he said.<eos>: 3.492439908750907
See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over.
The impact.<eos>: 80.71092622146561
Leverage, see?

He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.

—Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling.<eos>: 44.440839144990136
So a fellow coming in late
can see what turn is on and what turns are over.

—See?<eos>: 147.97768904243964
Tom Rochford said.

He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle,
stop: four.<eos>: 48.615582541204134
Turn Now On.

—I’ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him.<eos>: 22.720964645536508
One good
turn deserves another.

—Do, Tom Rochford said.<eos>: 72.53327512292618
Tell him I’m Boylan with impatience.

—Goodnight, M’Coy said abruptly.<eos>: 24.432468238782192
When you two begin...

Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.

—But how does it work here, Tommy?<eos>: 81.72148048458014
he asked.

—Tooraloo, Lenehan said.<eos>: 7.395398430674674
See you later.

He followed M’Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court.

—He’s a hero, he said simply.

—I know, M’Coy said.<eos>: 28.230256082645525
The drain, you mean.

—Drain?<eos>: 14.077854255173472
Lenehan said.<eos>: 4.4195814760828664
It was down a manhole.

They passed Dan Lowry’s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming
soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.

Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall
Lenehan showed M’Coy how the whole thing was.<eos>: 71.69153359328757
One of those manholes
like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it,
half choked with sewer gas.<eos>: 57.590438507675756
Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky’s vest
and all, with the rope round him.<eos>: 65.61720066130859
And be damned but he got the rope
round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.

—The act of a hero, he said.

At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past
them for Jervis street.

—This way, he said, walking to the right.<eos>: 47.90458579278942
I want to pop into Lynam’s to
see Sceptre’s starting price.<eos>: 39.40369289274587
What’s the time by your gold watch and
chain?

M’Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses’ sombre office, then at
O’Neill’s clock.

—After three, he said.<eos>: 46.12627962421314
Who’s riding her?

—O.<eos>: 19.550209583093583
Madden, Lenehan said.<eos>: 12.002165796677446
And a game filly she is.

While he waited in Temple bar M’Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle
pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter.<eos>: 52.39891768126952
Fellow might damn easy
get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.

The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal
cavalcade.

—Even money, Lenehan said returning.<eos>: 116.69423244798399
I knocked against Bantam Lyons in
there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn’t an
earthly.<eos>: 122.41529238735619
Through here.

They went up the steps and under Merchants’ arch.<eos>: 44.52238464011904
A darkbacked figure
scanned books on the hawker’s cart.

—There he is, Lenehan said.

—Wonder what he’s buying, M’Coy said, glancing behind.

—_Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye,_ Lenehan said.

—He’s dead nuts on sales, M’Coy said.<eos>: 19.72821402777659
I was with him one day and he
bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob.<eos>: 74.93562175543296
There were
fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and
comets with long tails.<eos>: 97.65490524606082
Astronomy it was about.

Lenehan laughed.

—I’ll tell you a damn good one about comets’ tails, he said.<eos>: 27.672370605658518
Come over
in the sun.

They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the
riverwall.

Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s,
carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.

—There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said
eagerly.<eos>: 40.35000599123599
The annual dinner, you know.<eos>: 36.94380401910562
Boiled shirt affair.<eos>: 56.644638064429266
The lord
mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan
Dawson spoke and there was music.<eos>: 82.43956089813193
Bartell d’Arcy sang and Benjamin
Dollard...

—I know, M’Coy broke in.<eos>: 38.842572363313785
My missus sang there once.

—Did she?<eos>: 59.462593590049195
Lenehan said.

A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number
7 Eccles street.

He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.

—But wait till I tell you, he said.<eos>: 30.30952967840128
Delahunt of Camden street had the
catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher.<eos>: 64.91874797540949
Bloom and the wife
were there.<eos>: 24.91751392407197
Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and
curacoa to which we did ample justice.<eos>: 95.22375663298824
Fast and furious it was.<eos>: 37.813422626165405
After
liquids came solids.<eos>: 16.839664149473737
Cold joints galore and mince pies...

—I know, M’Coy said.<eos>: 11.11380568171275
The year the missus was there...

Lenehan linked his arm warmly.

—But wait till I tell you, he said.<eos>: 44.82656711490932
We had a midnight lunch too after
all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o’clock the
morning after the night before.<eos>: 67.26345761742508
Coming home it was a gorgeous winter’s
night on the Featherbed Mountain.<eos>: 33.609911475099615
Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one
side of the car and I was with the wife on the other.<eos>: 40.23960076418007
We started
singing glees and duets: _Lo, the early beam of morning_.<eos>: 32.834564822955784
She was well
primed with a good load of Delahunt’s port under her bellyband.<eos>: 24.68335231652897
Every
jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me.<eos>: 57.25719166650101
Hell’s
delights!<eos>: 13.413468522779286
She has a fine pair, God bless her.<eos>: 39.99256172945265
Like that.

He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:

—I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time.
Know what I mean?

His hands moulded ample curves of air.<eos>: 51.221121217354565
He shut his eyes tight in
delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.

—The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh.<eos>: 45.042904650262706
She’s a gamey
mare and no mistake.<eos>: 15.489246827137007
Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the
comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear
and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot.<eos>: 49.80059245706913
But, by God, I
was lost, so to speak, in the milky way.<eos>: 23.43756122110507
He knows them all, faith.<eos>: 23.55966110316412
At
last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away.<eos>: 49.45277739295348
_And what star is that,
Poldy?_ says she.<eos>: 42.92030316667974
By God, she had Bloom cornered.<eos>: 22.710344744461413
_That one, is it?_
says Chris Callinan, _sure that’s only what you might call a pinprick._
By God, he wasn’t far wide of the mark.

Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft
laughter.

—I’m weak, he gasped.

M’Coy’s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave.<eos>: 48.28949624015017
Lenehan
walked on again.<eos>: 24.26432206918217
He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead
rapidly.<eos>: 17.257872604112052
He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M’Coy.

—He’s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously.<eos>: 26.672359184441344
He’s not one
of your common or garden...<eos>: 67.17177725317771
you know...<eos>: 12.479762724204734
There’s a touch of the artist
about old Bloom.

*    *    *


Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of _The Awful Disclosures of Maria
Monk_, then of Aristotle’s _Masterpiece._ Crooked botched print.
Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of
slaughtered cows.<eos>: 63.21564634334563
Lots of them like that at this moment all over the
world.<eos>: 40.04330600356595
All butting with their skulls to get out of it.<eos>: 16.237652490519263
Child born every
minute somewhere.<eos>: 84.89895932522222
Mrs Purefoy.

He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: _Tales of the
Ghetto_ by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.

—That I had, he said, pushing it by.

The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.

—Them are two good ones, he said.

Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.
He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his
unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.

On O’Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay
apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c.

Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles.<eos>: 66.66291919914735
_Fair Tyrants_ by James
Lovebirch.<eos>: 11.652059665968036
Know the kind that is.<eos>: 26.85716916487897
Had it?<eos>: 11.286097360979007
Yes.

He opened it.<eos>: 13.4525962253299
Thought so.

A woman’s voice behind the dingy curtain.<eos>: 30.6937787374285
Listen: the man.

No: she wouldn’t like that much.<eos>: 23.15495921484276
Got her it once.

He read the other title: _Sweets of Sin_.<eos>: 48.49685125379917
More in her line.<eos>: 21.67422128696783
Let us see.

He read where his finger opened.

_—All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on
wondrous gowns and costliest frillies.<eos>: 78.95116037449303
For him!<eos>: 7.498022938518581
For Raoul!_

Yes.<eos>: 19.88420960323643
This.<eos>: 5.761095916430078
Here.<eos>: 3.107997675956089
Try.

—_Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands
felt for the opulent curves inside her déshabillé._

Yes.<eos>: 75.1879278565355
Take this.<eos>: 11.204186261179718
The end.

—You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.

The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her
queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint.<eos>: 41.74028292764454
An imperceptible smile played
round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.

Mr Bloom read again: _The beautiful woman._

Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh.<eos>: 77.17442890304865
Flesh yielded amply
amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up.<eos>: 50.812068558531855
His nostrils arched
themselves for prey.<eos>: 57.77458384215892
Melting breast ointments (_for him!<eos>: 60.65152979243741
For Raoul!_).
Armpits’ oniony sweat.<eos>: 54.20217033545818
Fishgluey slime (_her heaving embonpoint!_).
Feel!<eos>: 50.15258890912869
Press!<eos>: 10.407980295508867
Crished!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
Sulphur dung of lions!

Young!<eos>: 88.3139607909862
Young!

An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of
chancery, king’s bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the
lord chancellor’s court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the
admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the
Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of
appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean
Accident and Guarantee Corporation.

Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy
curtains.<eos>: 34.47621648561661
The shopman’s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven
reddened face, coughing.<eos>: 24.8885525440863
He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on
the floor.<eos>: 15.543580473449792
He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along
it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.

Mr Bloom beheld it.

Mastering his troubled breath, he said:

—I’ll take this one.

The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.

—_Sweets of Sin,_ he said, tapping on it.<eos>: 37.55843266610685
That’s a good one.

*    *    *


The lacquey by the door of Dillon’s auctionrooms shook his handbell
twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.

Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell,
the cries of the auctioneer within.<eos>: 29.759998995086445
Four and nine.<eos>: 36.031023836403115
Those lovely
curtains.<eos>: 50.70674605151365
Five shillings.<eos>: 29.627157544906748
Cosy curtains.<eos>: 21.836197964232454
Selling new at two guineas.
Any advance on five shillings?<eos>: 96.50578611695272
Going for five shillings.

The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:

—Barang!

Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.

Gahan, their stretched
necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.

Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams’s row.
He halted near his daughter.

—It’s time for you, she said.

—Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said.<eos>: 34.15071594651465
Are
you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon
shoulder?<eos>: 58.51491237594354
Melancholy God!

Dilly shrugged her shoulders.<eos>: 46.5364866392643
Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and
held them back.

—Stand up straight, girl, he said.<eos>: 35.69564487372476
You’ll get curvature of the spine.
Do you know what you look like?

He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders
and dropping his underjaw.

—Give it up, father, Dilly said.<eos>: 31.409500777744988
All the people are looking at you.

Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.

—Did you get any money?<eos>: 41.071497452093936
Dilly asked.

—Where would I get money?<eos>: 28.566676063535194
Mr Dedalus said.<eos>: 4.4637900485294155
There is no-one in Dublin
would lend me fourpence.

—You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.

—How do you know that?<eos>: 32.26704459371949
Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.

Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along
James’s street.

—I know you did, Dilly answered.<eos>: 36.9927665576476
Were you in the Scotch house now?

—I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling.<eos>: 24.72802373667363
Was it the little nuns
taught you to be so saucy?<eos>: 45.14918925058734
Here.

He handed her a shilling.

—See if you can do anything with that, he said.

—I suppose you got five, Dilly said.<eos>: 23.55877959215708
Give me more than that.

—Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly.<eos>: 17.119833025672115
You’re like the rest of
them, are you?<eos>: 15.1152790773102
An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor
mother died.<eos>: 62.42586237476565
But wait awhile.<eos>: 20.482083209685687
You’ll all get a short shrift and a long
day from me.<eos>: 29.037778851220857
Low blackguardism!<eos>: 12.025879638262703
I’m going to get rid of you.<eos>: 10.220412474184155
Wouldn’t
care if I was stretched out stiff.<eos>: 23.56081660774055
He’s dead.<eos>: 7.909671621094602
The man upstairs is dead.

He left her and walked on.<eos>: 74.64721842607455
Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.

—Well, what is it?<eos>: 27.98232147792441
he said, stopping.

The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.

—Barang!

—Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.

The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell
but feebly:

—Bang!

Mr Dedalus stared at him.

—Watch him, he said.<eos>: 32.3084752339432
It’s instructive.<eos>: 11.945094975323835
I wonder will he allow us to
talk.

—You got more than that, father, Dilly said.

—I’m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said.<eos>: 21.535851755734054
I’ll leave you
all where Jesus left the jews.<eos>: 55.886175595829464
Look, there’s all I have.<eos>: 14.607815616176264
I got two
shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the
funeral.

He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.

—Can’t you look for some money somewhere?<eos>: 54.593573245771715
Dilly said.

Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.

—I will, he said gravely.<eos>: 18.0194970120068
I looked all along the gutter in O’Connell
street.<eos>: 23.565052856288354
I’ll try this one now.

—You’re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.

—Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies.<eos>: 21.644160588198478
Get a glass of milk
for yourself and a bun or a something.<eos>: 58.40554596765842
I’ll be home shortly.

He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.

The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of
Parkgate.

—I’m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.

The lacquey banged loudly.

Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing
mincing mouth gently:

—The little nuns!<eos>: 49.45931162846668
Nice little things!<eos>: 33.29453332162425
O, sure they wouldn’t do
anything!<eos>: 21.71511977577773
O, sure they wouldn’t really!<eos>: 26.505980356325818
Is it little sister Monica!

*    *    *


From the sundial towards James’s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with
the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James’s
street, past Shackleton’s offices.<eos>: 58.53843527742171
Got round him all right.<eos>: 20.056746996673322
How do you
do, Mr Crimmins?<eos>: 13.265537066869872
First rate, sir.<eos>: 17.345566320949725
I was afraid you might be up in your
other establishment in Pimlico.<eos>: 37.87551304840681
How are things going?<eos>: 60.26809172843936
Just keeping
alive.<eos>: 35.62823451013758
Lovely weather we’re having.<eos>: 48.32055451439146
Yes, indeed.<eos>: 8.677605449392791
Good for the country.
Those farmers are always grumbling.<eos>: 24.70647914184371
I’ll just take a thimbleful of your
best gin, Mr Crimmins.<eos>: 20.46025583525465
A small gin, sir.<eos>: 35.15925508107165
Yes, sir.<eos>: 5.073569478673312
Terrible affair that
_General Slocum_ explosion.<eos>: 15.998587792561752
Terrible, terrible!<eos>: 22.198383145809256
A thousand casualties.
And heartrending scenes.<eos>: 29.699664385056
Men trampling down women and children.<eos>: 39.75692898947504
Most
brutal thing.<eos>: 9.296492197991075
What do they say was the cause?<eos>: 35.225465528266646
Spontaneous combustion.
Most scandalous revelation.<eos>: 23.835506630214336
Not a single lifeboat would float and the
firehose all burst.<eos>: 57.32778611948292
What I can’t understand is how the inspectors ever
allowed a boat like that...<eos>: 58.76006669037049
Now, you’re talking straight, Mr Crimmins.
You know why?<eos>: 24.117784111447946
Palm oil.<eos>: 12.008890628100445
Is that a fact?<eos>: 13.901399503888587
Without a doubt.<eos>: 13.995918012334048
Well now, look
at that.<eos>: 17.122724634354363
And America they say is the land of the free.<eos>: 44.50401781960987
I thought we
were bad here.

I smiled at him.<eos>: 44.80928000335419
_America,_ I said quietly, just like that.<eos>: 33.53678380296077
_What is
it?<eos>: 16.738956439058903
The sweepings of every country including our own.<eos>: 50.18898421409872
Isn’t that true?_
That’s a fact.

Graft, my dear sir.<eos>: 20.925633509993535
Well, of course, where there’s money going there’s
always someone to pick it up.

Saw him looking at my frockcoat.<eos>: 64.29437896223195
Dress does it.<eos>: 15.588255117238079
Nothing like a dressy
appearance.<eos>: 41.27143301211091
Bowls them over.

—Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.<eos>: 14.636415513689947
How are things?

—Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.

Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter
Kennedy, hairdresser.<eos>: 45.611679913392265
Stylish coat, beyond a doubt.<eos>: 64.1202803948926
Scott of Dawson
street.<eos>: 13.053684856735714
Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it.<eos>: 47.105197037366764
Never built
under three guineas.<eos>: 62.521070797239545
Fits me down to the ground.<eos>: 24.72439933476744
Some Kildare street
club toff had it probably.<eos>: 83.27930341435156
John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian
bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he
remembered me.

Aham!<eos>: 61.38286594476803
Must dress the character for those fellows.<eos>: 41.648397055458
Knight of the road.
Gentleman.<eos>: 26.232667188791105
And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom
again, sir.<eos>: 35.10730889786564
The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying
has it.

North wall and sir John Rogerson’s quay, with hulls and anchorchains,
sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on
the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.

Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image.<eos>: 65.0693316608936
High colour, of course.
Grizzled moustache.<eos>: 30.723456455528805
Returned Indian officer.<eos>: 43.83931114423339
Bravely he bore his stumpy
body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders.<eos>: 26.384988477477545
Is that Ned
Lambert’s brother over the way, Sam?<eos>: 32.35306857637161
What?<eos>: 3.8546952873351206
Yes.<eos>: 2.0880743848448278
He’s as like it as damn
it.<eos>: 32.43326750534272
No.<eos>: 5.3673087592043816
The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there.<eos>: 15.285397740323688
Just a flash
like that.<eos>: 33.55573689989234
Damn like him.

Aham!<eos>: 15.208153985547272
Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath.
Good drop of gin, that was.<eos>: 49.822971278612336
His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to
his fat strut.

Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered.<eos>: 54.57778780912373
Greasy black rope.
Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant’s wife
drove by in her noddy.

Bad times those were.<eos>: 110.65404734401876
Well, well.<eos>: 8.564949061811278
Over and done with.<eos>: 33.791731659506546
Great topers too.
Fourbottle men.

Let me see.<eos>: 19.85592128224683
Is he buried in saint Michan’s?<eos>: 32.29277823757455
Or no, there was a midnight
burial in Glasnevin.<eos>: 56.63942037109882
Corpse brought in through a secret door in the
wall.<eos>: 39.88146878916934
Dignam is there now.<eos>: 14.970301774294597
Went out in a puff.<eos>: 23.609906556116286
Well, well.<eos>: 8.564949061811278
Better turn
down here.<eos>: 17.747773686229266
Make a detour.

Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the
corner of Guinness’s visitors’ waitingroom.<eos>: 17.730071216702928
Outside the Dublin
Distillers Company’s stores an outside car without fare or jarvey
stood, the reins knotted to the wheel.<eos>: 113.65280071837147
Damn dangerous thing.<eos>: 12.340877635580197
Some
Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens.<eos>: 19.182815742044248
Runaway
horse.

Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John
Henry Menton’s office, led his wife over O’Connell bridge, bound for
the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.

Mr Kernan approached Island street.

Times of the troubles.<eos>: 89.81908894490599
Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those
reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington.<eos>: 73.95683958479985
When you look back on it all now
in a kind of retrospective arrangement.<eos>: 36.37890556204797
Gaming at Daly’s.<eos>: 12.513377202663774
No
cardsharping then.<eos>: 14.198864584374595
One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the
table by a dagger.<eos>: 30.898243373958625
Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from
major Sirr.<eos>: 90.87480746903651
Stables behind Moira house.

Damn good gin that was.

Fine dashing young nobleman.<eos>: 96.19794975742334
Good stock, of course.<eos>: 34.671312169178435
That ruffian, that
sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away.<eos>: 92.69802079675326
Course they were on
the wrong side.<eos>: 24.78108539787106
They rose in dark and evil days.<eos>: 52.610606912113184
Fine poem that is:
Ingram.<eos>: 11.331660500732422
They were gentlemen.<eos>: 24.845887869030175
Ben Dollard does sing that ballad
touchingly.<eos>: 73.70670387899688
Masterly rendition.

_At the siege of Ross did my father fall._

A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping,
leaping in their, in their saddles.<eos>: 52.89587314973083
Frockcoats.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Cream sunshades.

Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.

His Excellency!<eos>: 47.29959373936545
Too bad!<eos>: 47.794078703723635
Just missed that by a hair.<eos>: 56.738556938627326
Damn it!<eos>: 12.791253361510275
What a
pity!

Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary’s
fingers prove a timedulled chain.<eos>: 38.40043730409266
Dust webbed the window and the
showtrays.<eos>: 11.994481050500587
Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails.
Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on
rubies, leprous and winedark stones.

Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights
shining in the darkness.<eos>: 61.11183730091652
Where fallen archangels flung the stars of
their brows.<eos>: 72.60286295468038
Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest
them.

She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic.<eos>: 24.557749008322453
A sailorman,
rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her.<eos>: 22.81524989520978
A long and seafed
silent rut.<eos>: 62.8651930840983
She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her
hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.

Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned
it and held it at the point of his Moses’ beard.<eos>: 80.82375542437899
Grandfather ape
gloating on a stolen hoard.

And you who wrest old images from the burial earth?<eos>: 71.4753085144675
The brainsick words
of sophists: Antisthenes.<eos>: 13.600474295674722
A lore of drugs.<eos>: 9.995907510403296
Orient and immortal wheat
standing from everlasting to everlasting.

Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through
Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella,
one with a midwife’s bag in which eleven cockles rolled.

The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the
powerhouse urged Stephen to be on.<eos>: 89.64098968700486
Beingless beings.<eos>: 22.896852275985484
Stop!<eos>: 6.676053278968138
Throb always
without you and the throb always within.<eos>: 110.173611167335
Your heart you sing of.<eos>: 47.775078069495336
I
between them.<eos>: 28.81474242696279
Where?<eos>: 4.213136859000814
Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I.
Shatter them, one and both.<eos>: 62.71824230448945
But stun myself too in the blow.<eos>: 25.421236180629222
Shatter me
you who can.<eos>: 47.813736672222184
Bawd and butcher were the words.<eos>: 60.22835649610773
I say!<eos>: 14.34782066457738
Not yet awhile.<eos>: 35.99110373880405
A
look around.

Yes, quite true.<eos>: 79.51071786910276
Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time.<eos>: 132.68841500859426
You
say right, sir.<eos>: 17.452214616818623
A Monday morning, ’twas so, indeed.

Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against
his shoulderblade.<eos>: 57.99256304299179
In Clohissey’s window a faded 1860 print of Heenan
boxing Sayers held his eye.<eos>: 28.871778255275526
Staring backers with square hats stood
round the roped prizering.<eos>: 35.62653099231688
The heavyweights in tight loincloths
proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists.<eos>: 75.17468143889799
And they are
throbbing: heroes’ hearts.

He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.

—Twopence each, the huckster said.<eos>: 50.890174760887795
Four for sixpence.

Tattered pages.<eos>: 96.87735499138738

I might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes.<eos>: 44.29027829306348
_Stephano Dedalo,
alumno optimo, palmam ferenti._

Father Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet
of Donnycarney, murmuring vespers.

Binding too good probably.<eos>: 26.520906655175327
What is this?<eos>: 9.723778522195634

Who wrote this?<eos>: 30.525368467314753
Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter
Salanka to all true believers divulged.<eos>: 29.555297667560247
As good as any other abbot’s
charms, as mumbling Joachim’s.<eos>: 24.49080735645696
Down, baldynoddle, or we’ll wool your
wool.

—What are you doing here, Stephen?

Dilly’s high shoulders and shabby dress.

Shut the book quick.<eos>: 50.81741010202357
Don’t let see.

—What are you doing?<eos>: 17.11918499174893
Stephen said.

A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides.<eos>: 34.71850400322815
It
glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots.<eos>: 83.21326908205302
I told her
of Paris.<eos>: 25.876552428722274
Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a
pinchbeck bracelet, Dan Kelly’s token.<eos>: 14.951570114355315
_Nebrakada femininum._

—What have you there?<eos>: 12.40301098026786
Stephen asked.

—I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing
nervously.<eos>: 35.982187912389456
Is it any good?

My eyes they say she has.<eos>: 53.58887204163636
Do others see me so?<eos>: 29.373257479473125
Quick, far and daring.
Shadow of my mind.

He took the coverless book from her hand.<eos>: 30.67864525444131
Chardenal’s French primer.

—What did you buy that for?<eos>: 19.622527648969278
he asked.<eos>: 5.051942343743682
To learn French?

She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.

Show no surprise.<eos>: 123.4070589166557
Quite natural.

—Here, Stephen said.<eos>: 12.353142502056421
It’s all right.<eos>: 7.542692923801093
Mind Maggy doesn’t pawn it on you.
I suppose all my books are gone.

—Some, Dilly said.<eos>: 42.00542460015475
We had to.

She is drowning.<eos>: 52.47502388960837
Agenbite.<eos>: 3.3117403737839837

Agenbite of inwit.<eos>: 66.2109906862127
Inwit’s agenbite.

Misery!<eos>: 36.200075360768516
Misery!

—Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.<eos>: 18.928248241868253
How are things?

—Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.

They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter’s.<eos>: 46.68442045389505
Father Cowley
brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.

—What’s the best news?<eos>: 28.962875186617964
Mr Dedalus said.

—Why then not much, Father Cowley said.<eos>: 14.881187732989526
I’m barricaded up, Simon, with
two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.

—Jolly, Mr Dedalus said.<eos>: 44.18245696432274
Who is it?

—O, Father Cowley said.<eos>: 7.548347070217383
A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.

—With a broken back, is it?<eos>: 53.846804398790624
Mr Dedalus asked.

—The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered.<eos>: 14.629353632782637
Reuben of that ilk.<eos>: 13.546514055315797
I’m just
waiting for Ben Dollard.<eos>: 25.54188996495716
He’s going to say a word to long John to get
him to take those two men off.<eos>: 55.642042927846795
All I want is a little time.

He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in
his neck.

—I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.<eos>: 43.56231218590947
Poor old bockedy Ben!<eos>: 27.583797567229507
He’s always
doing a good turn for someone.<eos>: 36.57436086787111
Hold hard!

He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.

—There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.

Ben Dollard’s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops
crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge.<eos>: 69.74851072827803
He came towards
them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.

As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:

—Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.

—Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.

Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben
Dollard’s figure.<eos>: 61.65694731448255
Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he
muttered sneeringly:

—That’s a pretty garment, isn’t it, for a summer’s day?

—Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I
threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.

He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes
from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:

—They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.

—Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said.<eos>: 51.88804107654267
Thanks be to
God he’s not paid yet.

—And how is that _basso profondo_, Benjamin?<eos>: 43.21175505518015
Father Cowley asked.

Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring,
glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.

Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter’s mouth, gave forth
a deep note.

—Aw!<eos>: 38.535498946243536
he said.

—That’s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.

—What about that?<eos>: 11.502642918937863
Ben Dollard said.<eos>: 17.022032160538043
Not too dusty?<eos>: 101.72377457467911
What?

He turned to both.

—That’ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.

The reverend Hugh C.<eos>: 24.461350457533918
Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint
Mary’s abbey past James and Charles Kennedy’s, rectifiers, attended by
Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of
hurdles.

Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward,
his joyful fingers in the air.

—Come along with me to the subsheriff’s office, he said.<eos>: 38.390350239296694
I want to show
you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff.<eos>: 60.68797095109362
He’s a cross between
Lobengula and Lynchehaun.<eos>: 17.88168822301591
He’s well worth seeing, mind you.<eos>: 59.058510998821646
Come along.
I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will
cost me a fall if I don’t...<eos>: 78.0142322237634
Wait awhile...<eos>: 31.97294646993035
We’re on the right lay,
Bob, believe you me.

—For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.

Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button
of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the
heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.

—What few days?<eos>: 58.10914064801288
he boomed.<eos>: 4.799424088923303
Hasn’t your landlord distrained for rent?

—He has, Father Cowley said.

—Then our friend’s writ is not worth the paper it’s printed on, Ben
Dollard said.<eos>: 32.37806245996048
The landlord has the prior claim.<eos>: 41.97052655423481
I gave him all the
particulars.<eos>: 10.320263025862456
29 Windsor avenue.<eos>: 34.04504165513465
Love is the name?

—That’s right, Father Cowley said.<eos>: 13.07332521441324
The reverend Mr Love.<eos>: 26.92352553659786
He’s a
minister in the country somewhere.<eos>: 12.70743006787336
But are you sure of that?

—You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that
writ where Jacko put the nuts.

He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.

—Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his
glasses on his coatfront, following them.

*    *    *


—The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they
passed out of the Castleyard gate.

The policeman touched his forehead.

—God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.

He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on
towards Lord Edward street.

Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head, appeared
above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.

—Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard.<eos>: 36.43584387569711
I wrote to Father
Conmee and laid the whole case before him.

—You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.

—Boyd?<eos>: 51.07561528415319
Martin Cunningham said shortly.<eos>: 11.56920025081215
Touch me not.

John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them
quickly down Cork hill.

On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed
Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.

The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.

—Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the _Mail_
office.<eos>: 66.83873219217442
I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.

—Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list.<eos>: 34.34112120267735
And put down the
five shillings too.

—Without a second word either, Mr Power said.

—Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.

John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.

—I’ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.

They went down Parliament street.

—There’s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh’s.

—Righto, Martin Cunningham said.<eos>: 29.964325630493857
Here goes.

Outside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney’s
brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.

John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took
the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked
uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson’s watches.

—The assistant town clerk’s corns are giving him some trouble, John
Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.

They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh’s winerooms.<eos>: 65.74549751501235
The
empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate.<eos>: 83.15292978152209
Martin Cunningham,
speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not
glance.

—And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as
life.

The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.

—Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and
greeted.

Long John Fanning made no way for them.<eos>: 69.61575945160378
He removed his large Henry Clay
decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all
their faces.

—Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations?<eos>: 54.77787445997616
he
said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.

Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly,
about their damned Irish language.<eos>: 83.8604516790266
Where was the marshal, he wanted to
know, to keep order in the council chamber.<eos>: 40.225218385119156
And old Barlow the
macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order,
no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little
Lorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him.<eos>: 32.95130440146188
Damned Irish language,
language of our forefathers.

Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.

Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to
the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held
his peace.

—What Dignam was that?<eos>: 56.235820614040456
long John Fanning asked.

Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.

—O, my corns!<eos>: 41.68435433588825
he said plaintively.<eos>: 6.647728941704739
Come upstairs for goodness’ sake
till I sit down somewhere.<eos>: 66.573636528929
Uff!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
Ooo!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
Mind!

Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning’s flank and
passed in and up the stairs.

—Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff.<eos>: 35.400183677267506
I don’t think
you knew him or perhaps you did, though.

With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.

—Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long
John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.

—Rather lowsized.<eos>: 48.65727797720192
Dignam of Menton’s office that was, Martin Cunningham
said.

Long John Fanning could not remember him.

Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.

—What’s that?<eos>: 20.980592364417536
Martin Cunningham said.

All turned where they stood.<eos>: 55.13713059178235
John Wyse Nolan came down again.<eos>: 32.09163918113516
From the
cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street,
harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering.<eos>: 63.51997807947842
Gaily they went
past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly.<eos>: 61.7043631324269
In saddles of the
leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.

—What was it?<eos>: 24.003581609541772
Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the
staircase.

—The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse
Nolan answered from the stairfoot.

As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his
Panama to Haines:

—Parnell’s brother.<eos>: 38.337897944858746
There in the corner.

They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man
whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.

—Is that he?<eos>: 48.994170264242186
Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.

—Yes, Mulligan said.<eos>: 18.78756394825233
That’s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.

John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw
went up again to his forehead whereat it rested.<eos>: 82.40265985214297
An instant after,
under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and
fell once more upon a working corner.

—I’ll take a _mélange,_ Haines said to the waitress.

—Two _mélanges,_ Buck Mulligan said.<eos>: 36.781549307346836
And bring us some scones and
butter and some cakes as well.

When she had gone he said, laughing:

—We call it D.B.C.<eos>: 65.1137002559769
because they have damn bad cakes.<eos>: 79.9045923843129
O, but you missed
Dedalus on _Hamlet._

Haines opened his newbought book.

—I’m sorry, he said.<eos>: 30.298998960069415
Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all
minds that have lost their balance.

The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:

—_England expects_...

Buck Mulligan’s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.

—You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance.
Wandering Ængus I call him.

—I am sure he has an _idée fixe,_ Haines said, pinching his chin
thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger.<eos>: 45.47737118161204
Now I am speculating what it
would be likely to be.<eos>: 21.446782754641788
Such persons always have.

Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.

—They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell.<eos>: 45.787795897406916
He will never
capture the Attic note.<eos>: 22.76193068067475
The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white
death and the ruddy birth.<eos>: 49.63300648963003
That is his tragedy.<eos>: 23.06834912729962
He can never be a poet.
The joy of creation...

—Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly.<eos>: 42.896823116401016
I see.<eos>: 6.544549756885207
I tackled him
this morning on belief.<eos>: 39.49291078143118
There was something on his mind, I saw.<eos>: 19.92097968560453
It’s
rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an
interesting point out of that.

Buck Mulligan’s watchful eyes saw the waitress come.<eos>: 73.9485221274548
He helped her to
unload her tray.

—He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid
the cheerful cups.<eos>: 38.45246535885144
The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny,
of retribution.<eos>: 64.50199586666378
Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea.
Does he write anything for your movement?

He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.
Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over
its smoking pith.<eos>: 89.52534387356336
He bit off a soft piece hungrily.

—Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing.<eos>: 40.96486823493436
He is going to write
something in ten years.

—Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.
Still, I shouldn’t wonder if he did after all.

He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.

—This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance.<eos>: 44.99840359464892
I don’t
want to be imposed on.

Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of
ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping
street past Benson’s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner _Rosevean_
from Bridgwater with bricks.

*    *    *


Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell’s yard.<eos>: 38.97463431267175
Behind
him Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with
stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith’s
house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square.<eos>: 46.876286620978235
Distantly behind him
a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.

Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr
Lewis Werner’s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along
Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.

At the corner of Wilde’s house he halted, frowned at Elijah’s name
announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of
duke’s lawn.<eos>: 42.854654879729424
His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun.<eos>: 12.933395410156823
With ratsteeth
bared he muttered:

—_Coactus volui._

He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.

As he strode past Mr Bloom’s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat
brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards,
having buffeted a thewless body.<eos>: 45.691760679028064
The blind stripling turned his sickly
face after the striding form.

—God’s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are!<eos>: 35.04379614107032
You’re blinder
nor I am, you bitch’s bastard!

*    *    *


Opposite Ruggy O’Donohoe’s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the
pound and a half of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s, porksteaks he had been
sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling.<eos>: 39.72617289607729
It was too blooming
dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs
MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping
sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney’s.
And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole
blooming time and sighing.

After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner,
stopped him.<eos>: 94.87189091310519
He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their
pelts and putting up their props.<eos>: 31.171472808022163
From the sidemirrors two mourning
Masters Dignam gaped silently.<eos>: 143.31211317204244
Myler Keogh, Dublin’s pet lamb, will
meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of
fifty sovereigns.<eos>: 49.506605330694164
Gob, that’d be a good pucking match to see.<eos>: 17.622597453000697
Myler
Keogh, that’s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash.<eos>: 26.372666444932687
Two bar
entrance, soldiers half price.<eos>: 167.6155118004427
I could easy do a bunk on ma.<eos>: 40.73088564541194
Master
Dignam on his left turned as he turned.<eos>: 68.02408934766258
That’s me in mourning.<eos>: 16.0103670578657
When is
it?<eos>: 10.016868817818692
May the twentysecond.<eos>: 5.92287822496528
Sure, the blooming thing is all over.<eos>: 32.4061387902998
He
turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap
awry, his collar sticking up.<eos>: 56.196111831009155
Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he
saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two
puckers.<eos>: 41.388238649492756
One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer
smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found
out.

Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on.<eos>: 56.06243595672038
The best pucker going
for strength was Fitzsimons.<eos>: 59.86259708768403
One puck in the wind from that fellow
would knock you into the middle of next week, man.<eos>: 65.74402308161994
But the best pucker
for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out
of him, dodging and all.

In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff’s mouth and
a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was
telling him and grinning all the time.

No Sandymount tram.

Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his
other hand.<eos>: 61.12050520436543
His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down.<eos>: 55.66723069383725
The
blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming
end to it.<eos>: 74.02739504795927
He met schoolboys with satchels.<eos>: 32.731495819725815
I’m not going tomorrow
either, stay away till Monday.<eos>: 68.60508198404779
He met other schoolboys.<eos>: 116.28570183338184
Do they notice
I’m in mourning?<eos>: 27.526305387594864
Uncle Barney said he’d get it into the paper tonight.
Then they’ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa’s
name.

His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a
fly walking over it up to his eye.<eos>: 74.19628560670527
The scrunch that was when they were
screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were
bringing it downstairs.

Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling
the men how to get it round the bend.<eos>: 79.07378577174899
A big coffin it was, and high and
heavylooking.<eos>: 47.72372275565097
How was that?<eos>: 7.6430788022664515
The last night pa was boosed he was
standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to
Tunney’s for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt.
Never see him again.<eos>: 74.07071361955066
Death, that is.<eos>: 8.81813243594346
Pa is dead.<eos>: 18.04049480116339
My father is dead.<eos>: 13.906844392959202
He
told me to be a good son to ma.<eos>: 21.750289263479004
I couldn’t hear the other things he
said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better.<eos>: 30.7799281151797
Poor
pa.<eos>: 32.36023583009555
That was Mr Dignam, my father.<eos>: 26.53226199938395
I hope he’s in purgatory now because
he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.

The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by
obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern
quays.<eos>: 73.27759863533774
The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the
metropolis.<eos>: 63.602627606886266
At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted
him vainly from afar.<eos>: 133.81944526346183

Dudley’s viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley
White, B.<eos>: 76.81402007199904

White’s,
the pawnbroker’s, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose
with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough
more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot
through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus.<eos>: 63.30248925632495
In the
porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding,
Collis and Ward saw him with surprise.<eos>: 39.338563725390934
Past Richmond bridge at the
doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the
Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed
her plan and retracing her steps by King’s windows smiled credulously
on the representative of His Majesty.<eos>: 69.98203350128568
From its sluice in Wood quay wall
under Tom Devan’s office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of
liquid sewage.<eos>: 85.93306967467525
Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by
bronze, Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head watched and admired.
On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse
for the subsheriff’s office, stood still in midstreet and brought his
hat low.<eos>: 50.70560519731261
His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus’ greeting.<eos>: 117.88657560855027
From

unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held
of yore rich advowsons.<eos>: 72.83459979114858
On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M’Coy, taking
leave of each other, watched the carriages go by.<eos>: 114.18208860813395
Passing by Roger
Greene’s office and Dollard’s big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell,
carrying the Catesby’s cork lino letters for her father who was laid
up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she
couldn’t see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring’s
big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its
being the lord lieutenant.<eos>: 90.250387688662
Beyond Lundy Foot’s from the shaded door of
Kavanagh’s winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness
towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland.<eos>: 47.67869821907451

James.<eos>: 77.57726665783463
Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the
approach of the cavalcade.<eos>: 109.12496169220948
Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley
fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret
waistcoat and doffed his cap to her.<eos>: 74.76753501251186
A charming _soubrette,_ great
Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from
her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon

John Henry
Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from
winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in
his fat left hand not feeling it.<eos>: 94.8228075825315
Where the foreleg of King Billy’s
horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from
under the hoofs of the outriders.<eos>: 59.306737652860924
She shouted in his ear the tidings.

By
the provost’s wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes
and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of _My girl’s a Yorkshire
girl._

Blazes Boylan presented to the leaders’ skyblue frontlets and high
action a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a
suit of indigo serge.<eos>: 52.71611612908333
His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute
but he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and
the red flower between his lips.<eos>: 73.70284143693459
As they drove along Nassau street His
Excellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of
music which was being discoursed in College park.<eos>: 65.93686434774335
Unseen brazen
highland laddies blared and drumthumped after the _cortège_:

     But though she’s a factory lass
     And wears no fancy clothes.
     Baraabum.
     Yet I’ve a sort of a
     Yorkshire relish for
     My little Yorkshire rose.

mayoress without his golden chain.<eos>: 142.198419421676
On Northumberland and Lansdowne
roads His Excellency acknowledged punctually salutes from rare male
walkers, the salute of two small schoolboys at the garden gate of the
house said to have been admired by the late queen when visiting the
Irish capital with her husband, the prince consort, in 1849 and the
salute of Almidano Artifoni’s sturdy trousers swallowed by a closing
door.

Bronze by gold, miss Douce’s head by miss Kennedy’s head, over the
crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing
steel.

—Is that her?<eos>: 66.67875416045275
asked miss Kennedy.

Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and _eau de Nil._

—Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.

When all agog miss Douce said eagerly:

—Look at the fellow in the tall silk.

—Who?<eos>: 42.47227364026683
Where?<eos>: 4.213136859000814
gold asked more eagerly.

—In the second carriage, miss Douce’s wet lips said, laughing in the
sun.

He’s looking.<eos>: 45.39454185280387
Mind till I see.

She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against
the pane in a halo of hurried breath.

Her wet lips tittered:

—He’s killed looking back.

She laughed:

—O wept!<eos>: 40.642214055328225
Aren’t men frightful idiots?

With sadness.

Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair
behind an ear.<eos>: 75.53010953701398
Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a
hair.<eos>: 126.8022196686913
Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.

—It’s them has the fine times, sadly then she said.

A man.

Bloowho went by by Moulang’s pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of
sin, by Wine’s antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by
Carroll’s dusky battered plate, for Raoul.

The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came.<eos>: 67.9457547733124
For them
unheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china.
And

—There’s your teas, he said.

Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned
lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.

—What is it?<eos>: 53.30436669617706
loud boots unmannerly asked.

—Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.

—Your _beau,_ is it?

A haughty bronze replied:

—I’ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your
impertinent insolence.

—Imperthnthn thnthnthn, bootssnout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as
she threatened as he had come.

Bloom.

On her flower frowning miss Douce said:

—Most aggravating that young brat is.<eos>: 54.05572382017636
If he doesn’t conduct himself
I’ll wring his ear for him a yard long.

Ladylike in exquisite contrast.

—Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.

She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea.<eos>: 56.33939839603877
They cowered
under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned,
waiting for their teas to draw.<eos>: 53.76816396194357
They pawed their blouses, both of black
satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and
seven.

Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear,
hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.

—Am I awfully sunburnt?

Miss bronze unbloused her neck.

—No, said miss Kennedy.<eos>: 80.89100412719753
It gets brown after.<eos>: 102.67907292976096
Did you try the borax with
the cherry laurel water?

Miss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror
gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their
midst a shell.

—And leave it to my hands, she said.

—Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.

Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce

—Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated.<eos>: 54.00103361599244
I asked that
old fogey in Boyd’s for something for my skin.

Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:

—O, don’t remind me of him for mercy’ sake!

—But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.

Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears
with little fingers.

—No, don’t, she cried.

—I won’t listen, she cried.

But Bloom?

Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey’s tone:

—For your what?<eos>: 45.30860071667825
says he.

Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed
again:

—Don’t let me think of him or I’ll expire.<eos>: 32.846624062759425
The hideous old wretch!<eos>: 52.194109544519414
That
night in the Antient Concert Rooms.

She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.

—Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters,
ruffling her nosewings.<eos>: 41.14320957152178
Hufa!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
Hufa!

Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy’s throat.<eos>: 54.8940509445059
Miss Douce
huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a
snout in quest.

—O!<eos>: 47.3218142035096
shrieking, miss Kennedy cried.<eos>: 18.76989480767003
Will you ever forget his goggle eye?

Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:

—And your other eye!

Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner’s name.<eos>: 68.57781710591063
Why do I always think
Figather?<eos>: 31.156130677635566
Gathering figs, I think.<eos>: 12.312536086294749
And Prosper Loré’s huguenot name.<eos>: 12.288806663974308
By
Bassi’s blessed virgins Bloom’s dark eyes went by.<eos>: 42.01143341995263
Bluerobed, white
under, come to me.<eos>: 56.99148108767972
God they believe she is: or goddess.<eos>: 90.56111124346914
Those today.<eos>: 18.966410959445938
I
could not see.<eos>: 10.555239986143292
That fellow spoke.<eos>: 23.093420023701317
A student.<eos>: 14.44430451544816
After with Dedalus’ son.
He might be Mulligan.<eos>: 121.55103009997123
All comely virgins.<eos>: 39.39812639389518
That brings those rakes of
fellows in: her white.

By went his eyes.<eos>: 139.1065107470209
The sweets of sin.<eos>: 16.53564754847383
Sweet are the sweets.

Of sin.

In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy
your other eye.<eos>: 131.50179981497877
They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let
freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other,
high piercing notes.

Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.

Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and
gigglegiggled.<eos>: 73.88626836705735
Miss Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled again her
nose and rolled droll fattened eyes.<eos>: 34.82860586030224
Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her
fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed,
spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter,
coughing with choking, crying:

—O greasy eyes!<eos>: 72.83833880080817
Imagine being married to a man like that!<eos>: 51.68928523363111
she cried.
With his bit of beard!

Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman,
delight, joy, indignation.

—Married to the greasy nose!<eos>: 105.7982487725183
she yelled.

Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each
each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze,
shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter.<eos>: 94.27906201100988
And then laughed more.<eos>: 38.55553881127003
Greasy I
knows.<eos>: 39.51990036731958
Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and
pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge.<eos>: 32.731699462292895
All flushed (O!),
panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.

Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom.

—O saints above!<eos>: 93.12143494657046
miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose.<eos>: 65.98363401116899
I
wished I hadn’t laughed so much.<eos>: 26.738116025497746
I feel all wet.

—O, miss Douce!<eos>: 27.25456042709408
miss Kennedy protested.<eos>: 13.926305389895704
You horrid thing!

And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.

By Cantwell’s offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi’s virgins, bright of
their oils.<eos>: 60.07394897864912
Nannetti’s father hawked those things about, wheedling at
doors as I.<eos>: 51.46501226632057

The sweets of sin.

Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.

Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus.<eos>: 79.48354978817179
Chips, picking chips off one of his
rocky thumbnails.<eos>: 54.984601679055935
Chips.<eos>: 1.9413698945532512
He strolled.

—O, welcome back, miss Douce.

He held her hand.<eos>: 34.25711024357032
Enjoyed her holidays?

—Tiptop.

He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.

—Gorgeous, she said.<eos>: 35.211971673078125
Look at the holy show I am.<eos>: 31.90585500809591
Lying out on the
strand all day.

Bronze whiteness.

—That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed
her hand indulgently.<eos>: 64.03464145089717
Tempting poor simple males.

Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.

—O go away!<eos>: 67.02056698671683
she said.<eos>: 3.4612706779243974
You’re very simple, I don’t think.

He was.

—Well now I am, he mused.<eos>: 19.336737029708836
I looked so simple in the cradle they
christened me simple Simon.

—You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer.<eos>: 61.594269621787845
And what did the
doctor order today?

—Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself.<eos>: 46.375895072065966
I think I’ll trouble
you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.

Jingle.

—With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.

With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane’s
she turned herself.<eos>: 56.50718452624364
With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from
her crystal keg.<eos>: 87.65378340830239
Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought
pouch and pipe.<eos>: 43.44936931276517
Alacrity she served.<eos>: 21.473175486867046
He blew through the flue two husky
fifenotes.

—By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains.<eos>: 21.14275896696001
Must be
a great tonic in the air down there.<eos>: 18.158448370310936
But a long threatening comes at
last, they say.<eos>: 36.54669040421821
Yes.<eos>: 2.0880743848448278
Yes.

Yes.<eos>: 5.624913993667841
He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid’s, into
the bowl.<eos>: 29.541756245219016
Chips.<eos>: 1.9413698945532512
Shreds.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Musing.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Mute.

None nought said nothing.<eos>: 138.91503779224072
Yes.

Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling:

—_O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas!_

—Was Mr Lidwell in today?

In came Lenehan.<eos>: 69.27710050119516
Round him peered Lenehan.<eos>: 68.11017644709227
Mr Bloom reached Essex
bridge.<eos>: 18.91484236024982
Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex.<eos>: 39.46747569204882
To Martha I must write.

Bloom.<eos>: 2.274976556565249
Old Bloom.<eos>: 8.835874424073097
Blue bloom is on
the rye.

—He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.

Lenehan came forward.

—Was Mr Boylan looking for me?

He asked.<eos>: 31.72551497709656
She answered:

—Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?

She asked.<eos>: 69.03081199859501
Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her
gaze upon a page:

—No.<eos>: 48.237449978120225
He was not.

Miss gaze of Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on.<eos>: 59.2320829576426
Lenehan round the
sandwichbell wound his round body round.

—Peep!<eos>: 63.47889251051435
Who’s in the corner?

No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures.<eos>: 54.922561745684206
To mind her
stops.<eos>: 41.136033055580626
To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.

Jingle jaunty jingle.

Girlgold she read and did not glance.<eos>: 113.53059423875929
Take no notice.<eos>: 16.72858975256657
She took no
notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:

—Ah fox met ah stork.<eos>: 65.80291760312149
Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your
bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?

He droned in vain.<eos>: 218.61384938093062
Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.

He sighed aside:

—Ah me!<eos>: 59.70890246904746
O my!

He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.

—Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.

—Who may he be?<eos>: 59.67462618565554
Mr Dedalus asked.

Lenehan opened most genial arms.<eos>: 46.22849993693589
Who?

—Who may he be?<eos>: 28.63300908975073
he asked.<eos>: 5.051942343743682
Can you ask?<eos>: 17.215345438437616
Stephen, the youthful bard.

Dry.

Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.

—I see, he said.<eos>: 59.20248571215566
I didn’t recognise him for the moment.<eos>: 9.544817222928634
I hear he is
keeping very select company.<eos>: 71.28405761839224
Have you seen him lately?

He had.

—I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan.<eos>: 35.36971446025698
In
Mooney’s _en ville_ and in Mooney’s _sur mer._ He had received the
rhino for the labour of his muse.

He smiled at bronze’s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes:

—The _élite_ of Erin hung upon his lips.<eos>: 36.88760379410965
The ponderous pundit, Hugh
MacHugh, Dublin’s most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel
boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of
the O’Madden Burke.

After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and

—That must have been highly diverting, said he.<eos>: 59.838964217619974
I see.

He see.<eos>: 19.63667400350787
He drank.<eos>: 14.57578748490788
With faraway mourning mountain eye.<eos>: 60.399355998098876
Set down his
glass.

He looked towards the saloon door.

—I see you have moved the piano.

—The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking
concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.

—Is that a fact?

—Didn’t he, miss Kennedy?<eos>: 45.23281758241224
The real classical, you know.<eos>: 47.96097852938887
And blind too,
poor fellow.<eos>: 35.34456380513793
Not twenty I’m sure he was.

—Is that a fact?<eos>: 32.299562425002996
Mr Dedalus said.

He drank and strayed away.

—So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.

God’s curse on bitch’s bastard.

Tink to her pity cried a diner’s bell.<eos>: 40.158006763538964
To the door of the bar and
diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of
Ormond.<eos>: 112.73986586146762
Lager for diner.<eos>: 6.623922729417786
Lager without alacrity she served.

With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for
jinglejaunty blazes boy.

Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the
oblique triple (piano!) wires.<eos>: 130.10581466006386
He pressed (the same who pressed
indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the
thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in
action.

Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in
Wisdom Hely’s wise Bloom in Daly’s Henry Flower bought.<eos>: 103.37648599456287
Are you not
happy in your home?<eos>: 30.327899035190562
Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo.<eos>: 27.48858821156265
Means
something, language of flow.<eos>: 51.68029280611701
Was it a daisy?<eos>: 16.21491065287347
Innocence that is.
Respectable girl meet after mass.<eos>: 99.15683968328996
Thanks awfully muchly.<eos>: 15.66154139665501
Wise Bloom
eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves.
Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all.<eos>: 106.59926990607718
Hair streaming: lovelorn.<eos>: 7.927673298938901
For
some man.<eos>: 12.267279335626405
For Raoul.<eos>: 7.216784509275005
He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat
riding on a jaunting car.<eos>: 87.34240201860732
It is.<eos>: 6.84500258575296
Again.<eos>: 2.296053679267296
Third time.<eos>: 5.986207637569946
Coincidence.

Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay.
Follow.<eos>: 125.16703897023962
Risk it.<eos>: 6.173246172764034
Go quick.<eos>: 10.03250358647948
At four.<eos>: 8.780480980584466
Near now.<eos>: 10.391522864178176
Out.

—Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.

—Aha...<eos>: 24.79398067677494
I was forgetting...<eos>: 38.38685166251737
Excuse...

—And four.

At four she.<eos>: 94.21083293525737
Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled.<eos>: 48.96993826745762
Bloo smi qui go.
Ternoon.<eos>: 20.980296196772453
Think you’re the only pebble on the beach?<eos>: 30.006514068843295
Does that to all.

For men.

In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.

From the saloon a call came, long in dying.<eos>: 126.25413555473298
That was a tuningfork the
tuner had that he forgot that he now struck.<eos>: 55.29495600241336
A call again.<eos>: 19.144438444767037
That he now
poised that it now throbbed.<eos>: 41.94586314678613
You hear?<eos>: 11.186899693300685
It throbbed, pure, purer, softly
and softlier, its buzzing prongs.<eos>: 15.100240677943926
Longer in dying call.

Pat paid for diner’s popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and
popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss
Douce.

—_The bright stars fade_...

A voiceless song sang from within, singing:

—...<eos>: 167.2901222107143
_the morn is breaking._

A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive
hands.<eos>: 98.03054495953381
Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording,
called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love’s
leavetaking, life’s, love’s morn.

—_The dewdrops pearl_...

Lenehan’s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.

—But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.

Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.

She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn,
dreamily rose.

—Did she fall or was she pushed?<eos>: 48.42862720948726
he asked her.

She answered, slighting:

—Ask no questions and you’ll hear no lies.

Like lady, ladylike.

Blazes Boylan’s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he
strode.<eos>: 66.19007742703005
Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar.<eos>: 60.26412731205837
Lenehan heard and
knew and hailed him:

—See the conquering hero comes.

Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered
hero.<eos>: 100.76581409700039
See me he might.<eos>: 22.191950153811444
The seat he sat on: warm.<eos>: 75.55798005216381
Black wary hecat
walked towards Richie Goulding’s legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.

—_And I from thee_...

—I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.

He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw.<eos>: 87.5944685375716
She smiled
on him.<eos>: 15.854114957749387
But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer
hair, a bosom and a rose.

Smart Boylan bespoke potions.

—What’s your cry?<eos>: 48.66723424940464
Glass of bitter?<eos>: 36.623401028059924
Glass of bitter, please, and a
sloegin for me.<eos>: 27.137963583221335
Wire in yet?

Not yet.<eos>: 83.34658257529995
At four she.<eos>: 40.22413397341903
Who said four?

Cowley’s red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff’s
office.

Avoid.<eos>: 41.82395402873395
Goulding a chance.<eos>: 23.127678896212416
What is he doing in the Ormond?<eos>: 28.013790720962003
Car waiting.
Wait.

Hello.<eos>: 33.88006508441586
Where off to?<eos>: 39.13823091178445
Something to eat?<eos>: 21.224211743318428
I too was just.<eos>: 28.27316787511173
In here.<eos>: 7.659937984131561
What,
Ormond?<eos>: 44.0756955097301
Best value in Dublin.<eos>: 29.5468561607137
Is that so?<eos>: 11.541684196887616
Diningroom.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Sit tight there.
See, not be seen.<eos>: 84.18693575615586
I think I’ll join you.<eos>: 13.444029630630373
Come on.<eos>: 7.061696993660674
Richie led on.<eos>: 29.187851961488725
Bloom
followed bag.<eos>: 66.27877972589671
Dinner fit for a prince.

Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her
bust, that all but burst, so high.

—O!<eos>: 78.54415483405141
O!<eos>: 5.45621285287314
jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch.<eos>: 18.833195853981593
O!

But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.

—Why don’t you grow?<eos>: 69.51895440047238
asked Blazes Boylan.

Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his
lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and
syrupped with her voice:

—Fine goods in small parcels.

That is to say she.<eos>: 77.96713182493559
Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.

—Here’s fortune, Blazes said.

He pitched a broad coin down.<eos>: 45.63654372918287
Coin rang.

—Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...

—Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.

—Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.

—I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking.<eos>: 49.25614314448291
Not on my own, you
know.<eos>: 20.411071321655754
Fancy of a friend of mine.

Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce’s
lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.
Idolores.<eos>: 59.42674259724782
The eastern seas.

Clock whirred.<eos>: 18.50715416400355
Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave),
bearing away teatray.<eos>: 178.22361896390305
Clock clacked.

Miss Douce took Boylan’s coin, struck boldly the cashregister.<eos>: 33.95348257086944
It
clanged.<eos>: 4.777775093538261
Clock clacked.<eos>: 3.267687758493652
Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till
and hummed and handed coins in change.<eos>: 61.10941704875944
Look to the west.<eos>: 19.326834624792827
A clack.<eos>: 3.4811936918257143
For
me.

—What time is that?<eos>: 11.398644272002619
asked Blazes Boylan.<eos>: 12.882616313214186
Four?

O’clock.

Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged
Blazes Boylan’s elbowsleeve.

—Let’s hear the time, he said.

The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered
tables.<eos>: 59.85214042673156
Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table
near the door.<eos>: 37.92902852040173
Be near.<eos>: 17.910290575058198
At four.<eos>: 8.780480980584466
Has he forgotten?<eos>: 36.68057187393515
Perhaps a trick.<eos>: 12.099877674638408
Not
come: whet appetite.<eos>: 9.245664554394695
I couldn’t do.<eos>: 6.14022069013027
Wait, wait.<eos>: 9.39412465725931
Pat, waiter, waited.

Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure’s skyblue bow and eyes.

—Go on, pressed Lenehan.<eos>: 62.98588795453493
There’s no-one.<eos>: 11.556823662553622
He never heard.

—...<eos>: 36.96263831123985
_to Flora’s lips did hie._

High, a high note pealed in the treble clear.

Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought Blazes
Boylan’s flower and eyes.

—Please, please.

He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.

—_I could not leave thee_...

—Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.

—No, now, urged Lenehan.<eos>: 57.138876454593564
_Sonnez la cloche!_ O do!<eos>: 29.233984307047088
There’s no-one.

She looked.<eos>: 19.593602775592924
Quick.<eos>: 2.337322066741968
Miss Kenn out of earshot.<eos>: 7.4666248845842516
Sudden bent.<eos>: 28.944550735680682
Two kindling
faces watched her bend.

Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord,
and lost and found it, faltering.

—Go on!<eos>: 61.87397439654738
Do!<eos>: 8.786772769126312
_Sonnez!_

Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee.<eos>: 39.33048904400825
Delayed.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Taunted
them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.

_—Sonnez!_

Smack.<eos>: 17.40427528065435
She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter
smackwarm against her smackable a woman’s warmhosed thigh.

—_La cloche!_ cried gleeful Lenehan.<eos>: 51.11928074131082
Trained by owner.<eos>: 30.687798345593375
No sawdust
there.

She smilesmirked supercilious (wept!<eos>: 131.02403454021191
aren’t men?), but, lightward
gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.

—You’re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.

Boylan, eyed, eyed.<eos>: 48.40331140546455
Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his
chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops.<eos>: 130.94864918124063
His spellbound
eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by
mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses
shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with
sunnier bronze.

Yes, bronze from anearby.

—...<eos>: 75.20170866559288
_Sweetheart, goodbye!_

—I’m off, said Boylan with impatience.

He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.

—Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly.<eos>: 55.728269009950004
I wanted to tell you.
Tom Rochford...

—Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.

Lenehan gulped to go.

—Got the horn or what?<eos>: 51.01957698947242
he said.<eos>: 3.492439908750907
Wait.<eos>: 2.366011761982759
I’m coming.

He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the
threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.

—How do you do, Mr Dollard?

—Eh?<eos>: 35.70293510471037
How do?<eos>: 8.740936958315336
How do?<eos>: 8.740936958315336
Ben Dollard’s vague bass answered, turning an
instant from Father Cowley’s woe.<eos>: 57.09672733939137
He won’t give you any trouble, Bob.
Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow.<eos>: 54.18903094665104
We’ll put a barleystraw in
that Judas Iscariot’s ear this time.

Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an
eyelid.

—Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily.<eos>: 32.39198710484554
Come on, Simon.<eos>: 16.49946961664465
Give us a
ditty.<eos>: 6.1057845331331855
We heard the piano.

Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders.<eos>: 90.57050858470133
Power for Richie.
And Bloom?<eos>: 51.368384654386716
Let me see.<eos>: 10.63279710347111
Not make him walk twice.<eos>: 50.38684789015812
His corns.<eos>: 25.64393371145355
Four now.
How warm this black is.<eos>: 109.57708090004394
Course nerves a bit.<eos>: 44.03393155164747
Refracts (is it?) heat.
Let me see.<eos>: 85.45880826564338
Cider.<eos>: 1.9402299770593328
Yes, bottle of cider.

—What’s that?<eos>: 14.35343606406411
Mr Dedalus said.<eos>: 4.4637900485294155
I was only vamping, man.

—Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called.<eos>: 24.912700466417505
Begone dull care.<eos>: 48.563082210342394
Come, Bob.

He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the:
hold him now) into the saloon.<eos>: 119.78782763934169
He plumped him Dollard on the stool.<eos>: 38.41795061050934
His
gouty paws plumped chords.<eos>: 14.770554000154753
Plumped, stopped abrupt.

Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning.<eos>: 75.84423347912984
Bothered, he wanted
Power and cider.<eos>: 42.04568711793701
Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.

Jingle a tinkle jaunted.

Bloom heard a jing, a little sound.<eos>: 53.80690253154416
He’s off.<eos>: 10.283378923327197
Light sob of breath Bloom
sighed on the silent bluehued flowers.<eos>: 70.96497820105947
Jingling.<eos>: 5.835043281921235
He’s gone.<eos>: 6.3638543092584055
Jingle.
Hear.

—Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said.<eos>: 29.263474112568833
God be with old times.

Miss Douce’s brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind,
smitten by sunlight.<eos>: 50.30882665815229
Gone.<eos>: 1.4412035960954581
Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting
light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord.<eos>: 53.38931991187753
She drew down
pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar
where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast
inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of
shadow, _eau de Nil._

—Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded
them.<eos>: 117.44631686184813
There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the
Collard grand.

There was.

—A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said.<eos>: 38.08799555501766
The devil wouldn’t stop him.
He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.

—God, do you remember?<eos>: 28.42402932391978
Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the
punished keyboard.<eos>: 39.98413702647796
And by Japers I had no wedding garment.

They laughed all three.<eos>: 81.05924095457651
He had no wed.<eos>: 34.728047934647414
All trio laughed.<eos>: 20.703765457851155
No wedding
garment.

—Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said.<eos>: 74.53768566261745
Where’s
my pipe, by the way?

He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe.<eos>: 50.17335022708021
Bald Pat carried
two diners’ drinks, Richie and Poldy.<eos>: 121.54313255696005
And Father Cowley laughed again.

—I saved the situation, Ben, I think.

—You did, averred Ben Dollard.<eos>: 29.415308526282963
I remember those tight trousers too.
That was a brilliant idea, Bob.

Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes.<eos>: 70.3841466444664
He saved the
situa.<eos>: 8.663498738377779
Tight trou.<eos>: 4.991983797993103
Brilliant ide.

—I knew he was on the rocks, he said.<eos>: 12.118279379306568
The wife was playing the piano in
the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and
who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business?<eos>: 47.31910728646972
Do you
remember?<eos>: 10.809504945816293
We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap
in Keogh’s gave us the number.<eos>: 76.50741192091377
Remember?

Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.

—By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.

Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.

—Merrion square style.<eos>: 72.17962212559746
Balldresses, by God, and court dresses.<eos>: 28.13077401175526
He
wouldn’t take any money either.<eos>: 19.32540884681717
What?<eos>: 3.8546952873351206
Any God’s quantity of cocked hats
and boleros and trunkhose.<eos>: 16.536809754163393
What?

—Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded.<eos>: 15.091273348326881
Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of
all descriptions.

Jingle jaunted down the quays.<eos>: 80.04479585949946
Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.

Liver and bacon.<eos>: 59.76856999777442
Steak and kidney pie.<eos>: 36.73544609704297
Right, sir.<eos>: 17.609140632361594
Right, Pat.

Mrs Marion.<eos>: 76.08512156238135
Met him pike hoses.<eos>: 13.633136950243076
Smell of burn.<eos>: 4.262368538655725
Of Paul de Kock.<eos>: 24.852885756449954
Nice
name he.

—What’s this her name was?<eos>: 30.874901746505188
A buxom lassy.<eos>: 3.668759912115912
Marion...

—Tweedy.

—Yes.<eos>: 32.75952666637015
Is she alive?

—And kicking.

—She was a daughter of...

—Daughter of the regiment.

—Yes, begad.<eos>: 30.31551879586847
I remember the old drummajor.

Mr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after

—Irish?<eos>: 71.34161289025815
I don’t know, faith.<eos>: 7.557357173136001
Is she, Simon?

Puff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.

—Buccinator muscle is...<eos>: 73.2456682477311
What?...<eos>: 12.1132672531289
Bit rusty...<eos>: 76.50369525227879
O, she is...<eos>: 18.819171000466913
My Irish
Molly, O.

He puffed a pungent plumy blast.

—From the rock of Gibraltar...<eos>: 78.7525505080947
all the way.

They pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze by
maraschino, thoughtful all two.<eos>: 52.56193895406396
Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace,
Drumcondra with Idolores, a queen, Dolores, silent.

Pat served, uncovered dishes.<eos>: 38.022651257863124
Leopold cut liverslices.<eos>: 13.0940515972471
As said before
he ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods’ roes

Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding
chords:

—_When love absorbs my ardent soul_...

—War!<eos>: 85.63988790998796
War!<eos>: 6.775307672128796
cried Father Cowley.<eos>: 16.952623356793755
You’re the warrior.

—So I am, Ben Warrior laughed.<eos>: 17.831917751771172
I was thinking of your landlord.<eos>: 19.645926564124746
Love or

He stopped.<eos>: 22.47745545060039
He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.

—Sure, you’d burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said
through smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.

In bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard.<eos>: 74.22654656004967
He would.

—Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added.<eos>: 26.51482094037582
Half time, Ben.
_Amoroso ma non troppo._ Let me there.

Miss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout.<eos>: 95.67906153344505

Strongly.

—Go on, blast you!<eos>: 22.412280195997447
Ben Dollard growled.<eos>: 45.68411483513708
Get it out in bits.

—_M’appari,_ Simon, Father Cowley said.

Down stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long
arms outheld.<eos>: 53.09012527031952
Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly.<eos>: 29.27362053950869
Softly
he sang to a dusty seascape there: _A Last Farewell._ A headland, a
ship, a sail upon the billows.<eos>: 46.688851029995284
Farewell.<eos>: 1.461606352611877
A lovely girl, her veil awave
upon the wind upon the headland, wind around her.

Cowley sang:

_—M’appari tutt’amor:
Il mio sguardo l’incontr..._

She waved, unhearing Cowley, her veil, to one departing, dear one, to
wind, love, speeding sail, return.

—Go on, Simon.

—Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben...<eos>: 60.41130602421861
Well...

Mr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting,
touched the obedient keys.

—No, Simon, Father Cowley turned.<eos>: 42.72280772670939
Play it in the original.<eos>: 14.467084316040498
One flat.

The keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.

Up stage strode Father Cowley.

—Here, Simon, I’ll accompany you, he said.<eos>: 37.305026127605515
Get up.

By Graham Lemon’s pineapple rock, by Elvery’s elephant jingly jogged.

Steak, kidney, liver, mashed, at meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom
and Goulding.<eos>: 64.41560403570134
Princes at meat they raised and drank, Power and cider.

Most beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: _Sonnambula._ He
heard Joe Maas sing that one night.<eos>: 169.41695337808477
Ah, what M’Guckin!<eos>: 15.496404612248353
Yes.<eos>: 2.0880743848448278

All lost now.
Mournful he whistled.<eos>: 43.11303168120775
Fall, surrender, lost.

Bloom bent leopold ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the vase.

—A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold.<eos>: 82.98548538542657
I know it well.

Never in all his life had Richie Goulding.

He knows it well too.<eos>: 69.00460105629624

Piano again.<eos>: 25.901856897663038
Sounds better than last time I heard.<eos>: 58.029459792678516
Tuned probably.
Stopped again.

Dollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.

—With it, Simon.

—It, Simon.

—Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind
solicitations.

—It, Simon.

—I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall
endeavour to sing to you of a heart bowed down.

By the sandwichbell in screening shadow Lydia, her bronze and rose, a
lady’s grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous _eau de Nil_ Mina
to tankards two her pinnacles of gold.

The harping chords of prelude closed.<eos>: 82.77041153213472
A chord, longdrawn, expectant,
drew a voice away.

—_When first I saw that form endearing_...

Richie turned.

—Si Dedalus’ voice, he said.

Braintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow
endearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine.<eos>: 155.07979296527648
Bloom signed to

So.<eos>: 4.161583005142314
That will do.<eos>: 8.56266717859573
Pat, waiter, waited,
waiting to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.

—_Sorrow from me seemed to depart._

Through the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves
in murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or whatdoyoucallthem
dulcimers touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their
each his remembered lives.<eos>: 137.21511934481677
Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each
seemed to from both depart when first they heard.<eos>: 183.97964576438196
When first they saw,
lost Richie Poldy, mercy of beauty, heard from a person wouldn’t expect
it in the least, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word.

Love that is singing: love’s old sweet song.<eos>: 107.90699039767878
Bloom unwound slowly the
elastic band of his packet.<eos>: 75.88344088869573
Love’s old sweet _sonnez la_ gold.<eos>: 17.16234178120306
Bloom
wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound
it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.

—_Full of hope and all delighted_...

Phial of cachous, kissing comfits,

Yes?<eos>: 5.0698603255667
Hands felt for the opulent.

Alas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.

—_But alas, ’twas idle dreaming_...

Good God he never heard in all his life
a note like that he never did _then false one we had better part_ so
clear so God he never heard _since love lives not_ a clinking voice
lives not ask Lambert he can tell you too.

Goulding, a flush struggling in his pale, told Mr Bloom, face of the
night, Si in Ned Lambert’s, Dedalus house, sang _’Twas rank and fame._

He, Mr Bloom, listened while he, Richie Goulding, told him, Mr Bloom,
of the night he, Richie, heard him, Si Dedalus, sing _’Twas rank and
fame_ in his, Ned Lambert’s, house.

Miss Douce withdrew her satiny arm, reproachful, pleased.

—Don’t make half so free, said she, till we are better acquainted.

George Lidwell told her really and truly: but she did not believe.

First gentleman told Mina that was so.<eos>: 73.32013276187968

I was just passing the time of day with old Troy of the D.<eos>: 58.4076960221801
M.<eos>: 2.1967246080865164
P.<eos>: 1.5609974020387252
at the
corner of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along
and he near drove his gear into my eye.<eos>: 74.70468630699071
I turned around to let him have
the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony
Batter only Joe Hynes.

—Lo, Joe, says I.<eos>: 59.07279998994584
How are you blowing?<eos>: 28.319605476655266
Did you see that bloody
chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?

—Soot’s luck, says Joe.<eos>: 33.468308754812
Who’s the old ballocks you were talking to?

—Old Troy, says I, was in the force.<eos>: 28.556597380371993
I’m on two minds not to give that
fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and
ladders.

—What are you doing round those parts?<eos>: 48.43226656015335
says Joe.

—Devil a much, says I.<eos>: 19.85355204632862
There’s a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the
garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane—old Troy was just giving
me a wrinkle about him—lifted any God’s quantity of tea and sugar to
pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a
hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury
street.

—Circumcised?<eos>: 107.38064181230045
says Joe.

—Ay, says I.<eos>: 5.66217395515995

hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can’t get a
penny out of him.

—That the lay you’re on now?<eos>: 36.01199410996305

—Ay, says I.<eos>: 5.66217395515995
How are the mighty fallen!<eos>: 66.57566055128711
Collector of bad and doubtful
debts.<eos>: 36.427115543519506
But that’s the most notorious bloody robber you’d meet in a
day’s walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of
rain.<eos>: 47.374044283407784
_Tell him,_ says he, _I dare him,_ says he, _and I doubledare him
to send you round here again or if he does,_ says he, _I’ll have him
summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a
licence._ And he after stuffing himself till he’s fit to burst.<eos>: 47.08106202116468

—Are you a strict t.t.?<eos>: 89.38854410235744
says Joe.

—Not taking anything between drinks, says I.

—What about paying our respects to our friend?<eos>: 47.87670964880421
says Joe.

—Who?<eos>: 6.49073628762254
says I.<eos>: 4.54832622268874
Sure, he’s out in John of God’s off his head, poor man.

—Drinking his own stuff?<eos>: 48.38700154452082
says Joe.

—Ay, says I.<eos>: 5.66217395515995
Whisky and water on the brain.

—Come around to Barney Kiernan’s, says Joe.<eos>: 24.621814533689413
I want to see the citizen.

—Barney mavourneen’s be it, says I.<eos>: 20.215886847367774
Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?

—Not a word, says Joe.<eos>: 32.50917965948522
I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.

—What was that, Joe?<eos>: 28.306118589715528
says I.

—Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease.<eos>: 24.809406783505263
I want to
give the citizen the hard word about it.

So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the
courthouse talking of one thing or another.<eos>: 56.66754708547626
Decent fellow Joe when he
has it but sure like that he never has it.<eos>: 71.3315959224625
Jesus, I couldn’t get over
that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber.<eos>: 35.84421121965008
For trading without a
licence, says he.

In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan.<eos>: 63.74119680723641
There
rises a watchtower beheld of men afar.<eos>: 121.9160288368036
There sleep the mighty dead as
in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown.<eos>: 81.5656031737824
A pleasant
land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport
the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock,
the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed
coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too
numerous to be enumerated.<eos>: 22.489126930195454
In the mild breezes of the west and of the
east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass
foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted
planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal
world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied.<eos>: 40.88493480640486
Lovely
maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing
the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects
as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts
of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful
insects.<eos>: 42.15814933998858
And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to
Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht
the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan’s land and of
Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the
sons of kings.

And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen
by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for
that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits
of that land for O’Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain
descended from chieftains.<eos>: 70.14854944632181
Thither the extremely large wains bring
foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach,
pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs,
drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale,
York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets
of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and
red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples
and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and
pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their
canes.

I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him.<eos>: 25.501546906862202
Come out here, Geraghty, you
notorious bloody hill and dale robber!

And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed
ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers
and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and
Cuffe’s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the
various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus
heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime
premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling,
cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting,
champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from
pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy
vales of Thomond, from the M’Gillicuddy’s reeks the inaccessible and
lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the
place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance
of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer’s firkins
and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great
hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.

So we turned into Barney Kiernan’s and there, sure enough, was the
citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that
bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would
drop in the way of drink.

—There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his
load of papers, working for the cause.

The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps.
Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that
bloody dog.<eos>: 38.42400417494264
I’m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off
a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper
about a licence.

—Stand and deliver, says he.

—That’s all right, citizen, says Joe.<eos>: 34.660514690239424
Friends here.

—Pass, friends, says he.

Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:

—What’s your opinion of the times?

Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill.<eos>: 32.400800372258615
But, begob, Joe was equal to
the occasion.

—I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his
fork.

So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:

—Foreign wars is the cause of it.

And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:

—It’s the Russians wish to tyrannise.

—Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I.<eos>: 41.34776367798071
I’ve a thirst on me
I wouldn’t sell for half a crown.

—Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.

—Wine of the country, says he.

—What’s yours?<eos>: 23.966373880204788
says Joe.

—Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.

—Three pints, Terry, says Joe.<eos>: 9.59246082253431
And how’s the old heart, citizen?<eos>: 26.134982860149833
says
he.

—Never better, _a chara_, says he.<eos>: 17.04136891326621
What Garry?<eos>: 5.331908033457733
Are we going to win?<eos>: 29.476293749948102
Eh?

And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck
and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.

The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was
that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired
freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded
deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed
hero.<eos>: 31.986914873685944
From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his
rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of
his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair
in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex Europeus_).
The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue
projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous
obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest.<eos>: 82.46284019831049
The eyes in
which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the
dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower.<eos>: 38.77954444927111
A powerful current of warm
breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his
mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations
of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the
summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to
vibrate and tremble.

He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to
the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a
girdle of plaited straw and rushes.<eos>: 51.4335003144616
Beneath this he wore trews of
deerskin, roughly stitched with gut.<eos>: 27.902580432174528
His nether extremities were
encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet
being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of
the same beast.<eos>: 25.9954045392953
From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled
at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with
rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and
heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine
hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane
O’Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh
O’Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O’Growney, Michael

Castile, the Man for Galway, The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte
Carlo, The Man in the Gap, The Woman Who Didn’t, Benjamin Franklin,

A couched spear of acuminated granite rested
by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe
whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a
supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which
his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a
mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.

So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the
sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid.<eos>: 132.15617110400407
O, as true as
I’m telling you.<eos>: 17.037300905882823
A goodlooking sovereign.

—And there’s more where that came from, says he.

—Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe?<eos>: 38.348468556681816
says I.

—Sweat of my brow, says Joe.<eos>: 15.114301103016057
’Twas the prudent member gave me the
wheeze.

—I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and
Greek street with his cod’s eye counting up all the guts of the fish.

Who comes through Michan’s land, bedight in sable armour?<eos>: 46.06151245931436
O’Bloom, the
son of Rory: it is he.<eos>: 26.47484217211763
Impervious to fear is Rory’s son: he of the
prudent soul.

—For the old woman of Prince’s street, says the citizen, the subsidised
organ.<eos>: 33.32819671166384
The pledgebound party on the floor of the house.<eos>: 12.71846843009288
And look at
this blasted rag, says he.<eos>: 21.60714613424949
Look at this, says he.<eos>: 13.870961414739197
_The Irish
Independent,_ if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman’s
friend.<eos>: 70.2679756782802
Listen to the births and deaths in the _Irish all for Ireland
Independent,_ and I’ll thank you and the marriages.

And he starts reading them out:

—Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne’s
on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son.<eos>: 51.012410972135015
How’s that, eh?<eos>: 10.605910945830432
Wright
and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the
late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and
Ridsdale at Saint Jude’s, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest,
dean of Worcester.<eos>: 21.202667785294707
Eh?<eos>: 8.027425029092774
Deaths.<eos>: 3.2954331815150586
Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London:
Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the
Moat house, Chepstow...

—I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.

—Cockburn.<eos>: 33.87025477889197
Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller,
Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street,
Liverpool, Isabella Helen.<eos>: 30.232347315840343
How’s that for a national press, eh, my
brown son!<eos>: 45.906924185595486
How’s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?

—Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose.<eos>: 21.5153264516979
Thanks be to God they had
the start of us.<eos>: 43.25696710851492
Drink that, citizen.

—I will, says he, honourable person.

—Health, Joe, says I.<eos>: 26.50022526937249
And all down the form.

Ah!<eos>: 44.47363064174633
Ow!<eos>: 8.765018060073668
Don’t be talking!<eos>: 10.657867320071823
I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.
Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.

And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came
swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him
there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred
scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage,
fairest of her race.

Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney’s
snug, squeezed up with the laughing.<eos>: 90.60151973915991
And who was sitting up there in
the corner that I hadn’t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob
Doran.<eos>: 50.53283868413869
I didn’t know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the
door.<eos>: 45.916892260242754
And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen
in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter
and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting
like a poodle.<eos>: 80.12371709998767
I thought Alf would split.

—Look at him, says he.<eos>: 34.67738046824794
Breen.<eos>: 6.709564827057465
He’s traipsing all round Dublin with a
postcard someone sent him with U.<eos>: 47.09532546824336
p: up on it to take a li...

And he doubled up.

—Take a what?<eos>: 48.58891517499812
says I.

—Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.

—O hell!<eos>: 25.027054288663575
says I.

The bloody mongrel began to growl that’d put the fear of God in you
seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.

_—Bi i dho husht,_ says he.

—Who?<eos>: 42.46000108967079
says Joe.

—Breen, says Alf.<eos>: 8.46203989743841
He was in John Henry Menton’s and then he went round
to Collis and Ward’s and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round
to the subsheriff’s for a lark.<eos>: 33.92627673289051
O God, I’ve a pain laughing.<eos>: 28.498747758082164
U.<eos>: 1.6621382579199797
p: up.
The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody
old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.

—When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy?<eos>: 126.7683557080116
says Joe.

—Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up.<eos>: 17.919881907736674
Is that Alf Bergan?

—Yes, says Alf.<eos>: 14.82294783099876
Hanging?<eos>: 8.613407445892527
Wait till I show you.<eos>: 20.585753928197718
Here, Terry, give us a
pony.<eos>: 13.230659694834292
That bloody old fool!<eos>: 37.51482059001513
Ten thousand pounds.<eos>: 56.12121390353221
You should have seen
long John’s eye.<eos>: 61.14674647181434
U.<eos>: 1.6621382579199797
p ....

And he started laughing.

—Who are you laughing at?<eos>: 72.16611791566166
says Bob Doran.<eos>: 7.260457590427464
Is that Bergan?

—Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.

Terence O’Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full
of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and
Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of
deathless Leda.<eos>: 55.452237802098374
For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and
mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour
juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day
from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.

Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born,
that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that
thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.

But he, the young chief of the O’Bergan’s, could ill brook to be
outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a
testoon of costliest bronze.<eos>: 71.44926456227778
Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork
was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of
Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of
God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the
British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress
of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the
wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to
the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.

—What’s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and
down outside?

—What’s that?<eos>: 54.93147212112483
says Joe.

—Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino.<eos>: 13.893056307960794
Talking about hanging,
I’ll show you something you never saw.<eos>: 53.00576172876128
Hangmen’s letters.<eos>: 11.498909888726875
Look at here.

So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his
pocket.

—Are you codding?<eos>: 24.824222652049947
says I.

—Honest injun, says Alf.<eos>: 10.436479436003642
Read them.

So Joe took up the letters.

—Who are you laughing at?<eos>: 56.389618985143606
says Bob Doran.

So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust.<eos>: 21.889877920279005
Bob’s a queer chap when
the porter’s up in him so says I just to make talk:

—How’s Willy Murray those times, Alf?

—I don’t know, says Alf.<eos>: 49.955003431319064
I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy
Dignam.<eos>: 43.86010450927768
Only I was running after that...

—You what?<eos>: 43.94529274976271
says Joe, throwing down the letters.<eos>: 23.561283007316636
With who?

—With Dignam, says Alf.

—Is it Paddy?<eos>: 30.15863136707825
says Joe.

—Yes, says Alf.<eos>: 4.669895942543234
Why?

—Don’t you know he’s dead?<eos>: 10.08794571584485
says Joe.

—Paddy Dignam dead!<eos>: 26.258832381160335
says Alf.

—Ay, says Joe.

—Sure I’m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as
a pikestaff.

—Who’s dead?<eos>: 20.659585116895936
says Bob Doran.

—You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.

—What?<eos>: 36.53092144587648
says Alf.<eos>: 4.46707518789288
Good Christ, only five...<eos>: 95.0882442122914
What?...<eos>: 12.1132672531289
And Willy Murray
with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim’s...<eos>: 70.47290989706678
What?<eos>: 3.8546952873351206
Dignam
dead?

—What about Dignam?<eos>: 59.502507609028825
says Bob Doran.<eos>: 7.260457590427464
Who’s talking about...?

—Dead!<eos>: 33.59009089449299
says Alf.<eos>: 4.46707518789288
He’s no more dead than you are.

—Maybe so, says Joe.<eos>: 24.37193853808102
They took the liberty of burying him this morning
anyhow.

—Paddy?<eos>: 63.68106337291376
says Alf.

—Ay, says Joe.<eos>: 5.0578447147322105
He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.

—Good Christ!<eos>: 42.58651613955849
says Alf.

Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.

In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by
tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing
luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of
the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge
of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face.<eos>: 118.4501292778887
Communication was
effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the
orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar
plexus.<eos>: 46.94737189791886
Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the
heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return
but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty
entities on the lower astral levels.<eos>: 30.72773924041214
In reply to a question as to his
first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously
he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had
summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them.
Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the
flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the
spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort
such as tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt and that the highest
adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature.
Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently
afforded relief.<eos>: 100.47276984628549
Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted
all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true
path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were
out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power.<eos>: 60.351356947302165
It was
then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the
defunct and the reply was: _We greet you, friends of earth, who are
still in the body.<eos>: 63.05086790886793
Mind C.<eos>: 7.24049689900714
K.<eos>: 1.3988768665296072
doesn’t pile it on._ It was ascertained
that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H.
J.<eos>: 51.23897804160999
O’Neill’s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the
defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment
arrangements.<eos>: 28.8399662504322
Before departing he requested that it should be told to
his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for
was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair
should be sent to Cullen’s to be soled only as the heels were still
good.<eos>: 92.65531893931666
He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in
the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made
known.

Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was
intimated that this had given satisfaction.

He is gone from mortal haunts: O’Dignam, sun of our morning.<eos>: 154.6828959349815
Fleet was
his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow.<eos>: 36.43432443518191
Wail, Banba, with
your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.

—There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.

—Who?<eos>: 30.01316351210488
says I.

—Bloom, says he.<eos>: 8.21800055236679
He’s on point duty up and down there for the last ten
minutes.

And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.

Little Alf was knocked bawways.<eos>: 93.62606159552685
Faith, he was.

—Good Christ!<eos>: 18.606257761965544
says he.<eos>: 3.7480867931816255
I could have sworn it was him.

And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest
blackguard in Dublin when he’s under the influence:

—Who said Christ is good?

—I beg your parsnips, says Alf.

—Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy
Dignam?

—Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off.<eos>: 39.31923724185408
He’s over all his troubles.

But Bob Doran shouts out of him.

—He’s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.

Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn’t
want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises.<eos>: 57.43738451589349
And Bob
Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you’re there.

—The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.

The tear is bloody near your eye.<eos>: 47.63628410874436
Talking through his bloody hat.
Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married,
Mooney, the bumbailiff’s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke
street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told
me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on
her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.

—The noblest, the truest, says he.<eos>: 50.35431965649821
And he’s gone, poor little Willy,
poor little Paddy Dignam.

And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that
beam of heaven.

Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round
the door.

—Come in, come on, he won’t eat you, says the citizen.

So Bloom slopes in with his cod’s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was
Martin Cunningham there.

—O, Christ M’Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters.<eos>: 52.947300712067836
Listen to
this, will you?

And he starts reading out one.

_7 Hunter Street,
Liverpool._


_To the High Sheriff of Dublin,
            Dublin._


_Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful
case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i
hanged..._

—Show us, Joe, says I.

—_...<eos>: 59.299163646075606
private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in
Pentonville prison and i was assistant when..._

—Jesus, says I.

—_...<eos>: 80.82694379211033
Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith..._

The citizen made a grab at the letter.

—Hold hard, says Joe, _i have a special nack of putting the noose once
in he can’t get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my
terms is five ginnees._

_H.<eos>: 76.43893954186231
Rumbold,
            Master Barber._


—And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.

—And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe.<eos>: 22.38953282485832
Here, says he, take them
to hell out of my sight, Alf.<eos>: 32.99929557512937
Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you
have?

So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn’t and
he couldn’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said
well he’d just take a cigar.<eos>: 66.78822083236048
Gob, he’s a prudent member and no mistake.

—Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.

And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with
a black border round it.

—They’re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang
their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.

And he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his
heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they
chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.

In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor.<eos>: 55.23909621711006
Their
deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever
wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so
saith the Lord.

So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom
comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the
business and the old dog smelling him all the time I’m told those
jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about
I don’t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.

—There’s one thing it hasn’t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.

—What’s that?<eos>: 68.73560468074675
says Joe.

—The poor bugger’s tool that’s being hanged, says Alf.

—That so?<eos>: 17.20114187194842
says Joe.

—God’s truth, says Alf.<eos>: 6.9703356170314255
I heard that from the head warder that was in
Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible.<eos>: 51.32647588065451
He told me when
they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like
a poker.

—Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.

—That can be explained by science, says Bloom.<eos>: 46.972471908951
It’s only a natural
phenomenon, don’t you see, because on account of the...

And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science
and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.

The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered
medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the
cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,
according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be
calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent
ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,
thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly
dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood
to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ
resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a
morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo
mortis per diminutionem capitis._

So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and
he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard
and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe
with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported
for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this,
that and the other.<eos>: 49.990559041728986
Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a
new dog so he ought.<eos>: 74.76015974638403
Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all
round the place and scratching his scabs.<eos>: 39.75105257368837
And round he goes to Bob
Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could
get.<eos>: 119.86242809579566
So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:

—Give us the paw!<eos>: 57.38546920177542
Give the paw, doggy!<eos>: 12.121320100361677
Good old doggy!<eos>: 10.209350189088646
Give the paw
here!<eos>: 24.78252771448237
Give us the paw!

Arrah, bloody end to the paw he’d paw and Alf trying to keep him from
tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking
all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and
intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip.<eos>: 82.12750823499573
Then he starts scraping a few
bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs’ tin he told Terry to
bring.<eos>: 61.039743641655974
Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging
out of him a yard long for more.<eos>: 57.25980895395977
Near ate the tin and all, hungry
bloody mongrel.

And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the
brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet
and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and
she’s far from the land.<eos>: 142.91093878677972
And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown
cigar putting on swank with his lardy face.<eos>: 28.521074879058794
Phenomenon!<eos>: 6.09809292427817
The fat heap he
married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.
Time they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me
there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and
Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing
bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating
meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and
taking the lout out for a walk.<eos>: 59.07803044364048
And one time he led him the rounds of
Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought
him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him
the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn’t near
roast him, it’s a queer story, the old one, Bloom’s wife and Mrs O’Dowd
that kept the hotel.<eos>: 67.93531629650607
Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them
off chewing the fat.<eos>: 64.13522136201188
And Bloom with his _but don’t you see?_ and _but
on the other hand_.<eos>: 32.11799571474125
And sure, more be token, the lout I’m told was in
Power’s after, the blender’s, round in Cope street going home footless
in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the
samples in the bloody establishment.<eos>: 64.8010952148647
Phenomenon!

—The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and
glaring at Bloom.

—Ay, ay, says Joe.

—You don’t grasp my point, says Bloom.<eos>: 16.725677823474875
What I mean is...

—_Sinn Fein!_ says the citizen.<eos>: 18.44517065411456
_Sinn Fein amhain!_ The friends we love
are by our side and the foes we hate before us.

The last farewell was affecting in the extreme.<eos>: 88.36364802039633
From the belfries far
and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the
gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums
punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance.<eos>: 48.75031514228454
The deafening
claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the
ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its
supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle.<eos>: 88.62731404949997
A torrential rain
poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared
heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest
computation five hundred thousand persons.<eos>: 50.31346717720297
A posse of Dublin
Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person
maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and
reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on
their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from
the cradle by Speranza’s plaintive muse.<eos>: 46.3846493961722
Special quick excursion trains
and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our
country cousins of whom there were large contingents.<eos>: 61.11638509855816
Considerable
amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and
M-ll-g-n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual
mirth-provoking fashion.<eos>: 217.14389554952336
Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade
with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody
who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will
grudge them their hardearned pennies.<eos>: 99.93756856854627
The children of the Male and
Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the
scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day’s
entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the
Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and
motherless children a genuinely instructive treat.<eos>: 90.43298329286637
The viceregal
houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their
Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while
the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald
Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite.<eos>: 76.09651450767696
The delegation,
present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone
(the semiparalysed _doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his
seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul
Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the
Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha

All the
delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest
possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which
they had been called upon to witness.<eos>: 62.52738218939258
An animated altercation (in which
all took part) ensued among the F.<eos>: 158.14695461368842
O.<eos>: 2.146866114935731
T.<eos>: 3.737471984495714
E.<eos>: 1.5381861561152315
I.<eos>: 6.524879146559638
as to whether the eighth
or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland’s
patron saint.<eos>: 81.13780349188279
In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars,
boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas,
catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to
and blows were freely exchanged.<eos>: 15.625382980971835
The baby policeman, Constable
MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly
restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth
of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending
parties.<eos>: 81.61728649926918
The readywitted ninefooter’s suggestion at once appealed to
all and was unanimously accepted.<eos>: 38.89335343738654
Constable MacFadden was heartily
congratulated by all the F.<eos>: 35.99420611916719
O.<eos>: 2.146866114935731
T.<eos>: 3.737471984495714
E.<eos>: 1.5381861561152315
I., several of whom were bleeding
profusely.<eos>: 105.848185330785
Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from
underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal
adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his
thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the
pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their
senses.<eos>: 46.55913959771991
The objects (which included several hundred ladies’ and
gentlemen’s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their
rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.

Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless
morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus
Cruentus_.<eos>: 100.77999980246511
He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough
which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate—short, painstaking
yet withal so characteristic of the man.<eos>: 186.2547393812074
The arrival of the
worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the
huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in
their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates
cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio,
chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah_, amid which the ringing
_evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling
those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani
beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable.<eos>: 39.87004268494894
It
was exactly seventeen o’clock.<eos>: 35.55572893076681
The signal for prayer was then promptly
given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the
commendatore’s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession
of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his
medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi.<eos>: 64.01951913338847
The learned prelate who
administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when
about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a
pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to
the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication.<eos>: 60.25829571809054
Hard by the block
stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in
a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which
his eyes glowered furiously.<eos>: 42.637054274291856
As he awaited the fatal signal he tested
the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or
decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been
provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office.<eos>: 72.46391591671438
On a
handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering
knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially
supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and
Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the
duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully
extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most
precious blood of the most precious victim.<eos>: 47.964257047237474
The housesteward of the
amalgamated cats’ and dogs’ home was in attendance to convey these
vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution.<eos>: 45.07991099027273
Quite an
excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and
onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and
invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for
the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital
spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the
proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in
these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying
wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in
aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers’
association as a token of his regard and esteem.<eos>: 85.30423547357793
The _nec_ and _non
plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst
her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself
upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into
eternity for her sake.<eos>: 61.47910800936872
The hero folded her willowy form in a loving
embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_.<eos>: 65.41008210994961
Encouraged by this use of
her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable
areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her
ardour to reach.<eos>: 67.0719576003139
She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of
their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would
never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips
as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park.<eos>: 75.4859649857047
She
brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood
together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the
innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present,
they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable
pastor, joining in the general merriment.<eos>: 41.2095754415757
That monster audience simply
rocked with delight.<eos>: 59.84423867673817
But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped
their hands for the last time.<eos>: 47.27275583913936
A fresh torrent of tears burst from
their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the
inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being
the aged prebendary himself.<eos>: 47.434372463828645
Big strong men, officers of the peace and
genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of
their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye
in that record assemblage.<eos>: 75.78057066839115
A most romantic incident occurred when a
handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair
sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and
genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady,
requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot.<eos>: 56.46555233505543
Every
lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the
occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and
generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the
gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most
timehonoured names in Albion’s history) placed on the finger of his
blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in
the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds.<eos>: 56.88114884699756
Nay,
even the stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell
ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had
blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without
flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion.<eos>: 43.12415356646326
With his mailed
gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those
privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage,_ to
murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:

—God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart.<eos>: 46.1968070597627
Blimey it
makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause
I thinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down Limehouse way.

So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the
corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak
their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a
quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he
cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the
antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland.<eos>: 92.99634443862873
Antitreating is
about the size of it.<eos>: 23.61355070278976
Gob, he’d let you pour all manner of drink down
his throat till the Lord would call him before you’d ever see the froth
of his pint.<eos>: 64.01080486601218
And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their
musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of
hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly
blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen
bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and
oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh
entertainment, don’t be talking.<eos>: 66.61914529276964
Ireland sober is Ireland free.<eos>: 117.14914865307685
And
then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers
shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of.<eos>: 78.93499948948042
And one or two
sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the
females, hitting below the belt.

So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty
starts mousing around by Joe and me.<eos>: 115.64618077658076
I’d train him by kindness, so I
would, if he was my dog.<eos>: 44.64299111258291
Give him a rousing fine kick now and again
where it wouldn’t blind him.

—Afraid he’ll bite you?<eos>: 58.2090811525208
says the citizen, jeering.

—No, says I.<eos>: 6.5675155566952705
But he might take my leg for a lamppost.

So he calls the old dog over.

—What’s on you, Garry?<eos>: 30.861670548802344
says he.

Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the
old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.
Such growling you never heard as they let off between them.<eos>: 64.59020540750764
Someone
that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono
publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of
that.<eos>: 53.12548750389472
Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth
is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.

All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the
lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not
missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the
famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_
of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends
and acquaintances Owen Garry.<eos>: 86.77082659005659
The exhibition, which is the result of
years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary
system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse.
Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from
us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and
compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_
resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic
bards.<eos>: 80.39519811568087
We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with
which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym
of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but
rather (as a contributor D.<eos>: 67.46977934807312
O.<eos>: 2.146866114935731
C.<eos>: 3.246585668467089
points out in an interesting
communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and
more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the
famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more
modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye.<eos>: 65.8740309629888
We subjoin a
specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar
whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we
believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more
than an indication.<eos>: 119.21652763325422
The metrical system of the canine original, which
recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh
englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will
agree that the spirit has been well caught.<eos>: 58.79605818334678
Perhaps it should be added
that the effect is greatly increased if Owen’s verse be spoken somewhat
slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.

     The curse of my curses
     Seven days every day
     And seven dry Thursdays
     On you, Barney Kiernan,
     Has no sup of water
     To cool my courage,
     And my guts red roaring
     After Lowry’s lights.

So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could
hear him lapping it up a mile off.<eos>: 126.3109854854358
And Joe asked him would he have
another.

—I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there’s no ill feeling.

Gob, he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking.<eos>: 44.57081756875577
Arsing around from one
pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap’s dog
and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators.<eos>: 54.823805540959164
Entertainment for
man and beast.<eos>: 40.72800158055922
And says Joe:

—Could you make a hole in another pint?

—Could a swim duck?<eos>: 60.983887525015554
says I.

—Same again, Terry, says Joe.<eos>: 14.879416700928443
Are you sure you won’t have anything in
the way of liquid refreshment?<eos>: 24.773576157777594
says he.

—Thank you, no, says Bloom.<eos>: 9.305950022015661
As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet
Martin Cunningham, don’t you see, about this insurance of poor
Dignam’s.<eos>: 38.34407304718725
Martin asked me to go to the house.<eos>: 20.02462157175734
You see, he, Dignam, I
mean, didn’t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the
time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the
policy.

—Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old Shylock is
landed.<eos>: 33.24300831746702
So the wife comes out top dog, what?

—Well, that’s a point, says Bloom, for the wife’s admirers.

—Whose admirers?<eos>: 35.29010485047745
says Joe.

—The wife’s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.

Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act
like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit
of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that
Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow
contested the mortgagee’s right till he near had the head of me addled
with his mortgagor under the act.<eos>: 48.458166527336346
He was bloody safe he wasn’t run in
himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a
friend in court.<eos>: 62.94355838656146
Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal
Hungarian privileged lottery.<eos>: 160.73901758091029
True as you’re there.<eos>: 14.341564981669261
O, commend me to an
israelite!<eos>: 19.092437015965878
Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.

So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he
was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and
to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was
never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that’s dead to tell her.
Choking with bloody foolery.<eos>: 85.12963087787455
And shaking Bloom’s hand doing the tragic
to tell her that.<eos>: 41.06081750034923
Shake hands, brother.<eos>: 24.299366279430636
You’re a rogue and I’m another.

—Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however
slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is
founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to
request of you this favour.<eos>: 83.95715598237989
But, should I have overstepped the limits
of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my
boldness.

—No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which
actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me
consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow,
this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness
of the cup.

—Then suffer me to take your hand, said he.<eos>: 53.58519792252881
The goodness of your heart,
I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the
expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose
poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of
speech.

And off with him and out trying to walk straight.<eos>: 125.14761290821366
Boosed at five
o’clock.<eos>: 25.55918817384561
Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the
bobby, 14A.<eos>: 51.93723753300963
Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after
closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard,
drinking porter out of teacups.<eos>: 73.53452675428454
And calling himself a Frenchy for the
shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he
serving mass in Adam and Eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut,
who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and
smugging.<eos>: 47.53404947287238
And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his
pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed
and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another.<eos>: 72.09088470780608
_How is your
testament?<eos>: 16.684737367000018
Have you got an old testament?_ Only Paddy was passing
there, I tell you what.<eos>: 65.01032004288257
Then see him of a Sunday with his little
concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the
chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as
pie, doing the little lady.<eos>: 77.53644029517864
Jack Mooney’s sister.<eos>: 20.032496935999053
And the old
prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples.<eos>: 73.84181842156906
Gob, Jack
made him toe the line.<eos>: 52.237666935490644
Told him if he didn’t patch up the pot, Jesus,
he’d kick the shite out of him.

So Terry brought the three pints.

—Here, says Joe, doing the honours.<eos>: 27.752675740724428
Here, citizen.

—_Slan leat_, says he.

—Fortune, Joe, says I.<eos>: 10.700053685512357
Good health, citizen.

Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already.<eos>: 76.91308068230506
Want a small
fortune to keep him in drinks.

—Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf?<eos>: 45.56164781546126
says Joe.

—Friend of yours, says Alf.

—Nannan?<eos>: 11.432661733550486
says Joe.<eos>: 3.3094739023780617
The mimber?

—I won’t mention any names, says Alf.

—I thought so, says Joe.<eos>: 13.049003459471866
I saw him up at that meeting now with William
Field, M.<eos>: 62.254134459203506
P., the cattle traders.

—Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of
all countries and the idol of his own.

So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and
the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen
sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his
sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the
guaranteed remedy for timber tongue.<eos>: 40.427753890106196
Because he was up one time in a
knacker’s yard.<eos>: 21.71394913510691
Walking about with his book and pencil here’s my head
and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot
for giving lip to a grazier.<eos>: 95.07675663822162
Mister Knowall.<eos>: 4.252076003322209

Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used
to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O’Dowd crying her eyes out
with her eight inches of fat all over her.<eos>: 70.97320930078197
Couldn’t loosen her farting
strings but old cod’s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do
it.<eos>: 55.37297419372657
What’s your programme today?<eos>: 17.178030954885187
Ay.<eos>: 2.4577195247332724
Humane methods.<eos>: 16.987852849969986
Because the poor
animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn’t
cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently.<eos>: 135.18980283582133
Gob,
he’d have a soft hand under a hen.

Ga Ga Gara.<eos>: 29.795517796190392

Black Liz is our hen.<eos>: 11.323739247914904

fresh egg.<eos>: 54.720913712362744
Ga ga ga ga Gara.<eos>: 42.75776401329869
Klook Klook Klook.

—Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London
to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.

—Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going?<eos>: 56.00500698454589
I wanted to see
him, as it happens.

—Well, he’s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.

—That’s too bad, says Bloom.<eos>: 14.214806314880457
I wanted particularly.<eos>: 40.99914982716071
Perhaps only Mr
Field is going.<eos>: 54.07268426316535
I couldn’t phone.<eos>: 5.737613775028393
No.<eos>: 5.3673087592043816
You’re sure?

—Nannan’s going too, says Joe.<eos>: 11.771727196530257
The league told him to ask a question
tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the
park.<eos>: 55.31520977795525
What do you think of that, citizen?<eos>: 13.3037091406744
_The Sluagh na h-Eireann_.

Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham.<eos>: 26.05976170187613
Nat.): Arising out of the question of my
honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right
honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that
these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is
forthcoming as to their pathological condition?

Mr Allfours (Tamoshant.<eos>: 119.74335634867202
Con.): Honourable members are already in
possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole
house.<eos>: 157.6734426939054
I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that.<eos>: 54.06318198590787
The answer to the
honourable member’s question is in the affirmative.

Mr Orelli O’Reilly (Montenotte.<eos>: 30.751082369021514
Nat.): Have similar orders been issued
for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the
Phoenix park?

Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.

Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman’s famous
Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury
bench?<eos>: 88.25531920851894
(O!<eos>: 10.385188507192376
O!)

Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.

Mr Staylewit (Buncombe.<eos>: 48.24788336920276
Ind.): Don’t hesitate to shoot.

(Ironical opposition cheers.)

The speaker: Order!<eos>: 52.34956387711299
Order!

(The house rises.<eos>: 84.49574504098338
Cheers.)

—There’s the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival.<eos>: 28.23553956814845
There
he is sitting there.<eos>: 22.503293987346666
The man that got away James Stephens.<eos>: 70.04464273686989
The champion
of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot.<eos>: 226.23907005070754
What was your best
throw, citizen?

—_Na bacleis_, says the citizen, letting on to be modest.<eos>: 26.153786208924696
There was a
time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.

—Put it there, citizen, says Joe.<eos>: 26.48864312232837
You were and a bloody sight better.

—Is that really a fact?<eos>: 54.37098864831806
says Alf.

—Yes, says Bloom.<eos>: 5.972631538354086
That’s well known.<eos>: 18.89498456271075
Did you not know that?

So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of
lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil
and building up a nation once again and all to that.<eos>: 110.71968016344636
And of course
Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower’s heart
violent exercise was bad.<eos>: 89.86647381774766
I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a
straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: _Look at, Bloom.
Do you see that straw?<eos>: 72.92586014199509
That’s a straw_.<eos>: 4.762453212666126
Declare to my aunt he’d talk
about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.

A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian
O’Ciarnain’s_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of
_Sluagh na h-Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the
importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and
ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race.<eos>: 59.085479016968804
The
venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the
attendance was of large dimensions.<eos>: 67.16307633358772
After an instructive discourse by
the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed,
a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high
standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the
revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic
forefathers.<eos>: 55.319165460319674
The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of
our old tongue, Mr Joseph M’Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for
the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised
morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best
traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient
ages.<eos>: 71.76157988723759
L.<eos>: 1.7901774154014805
Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses,
having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the
discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty
plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy
rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis’ evergreen verses
(happily too familiar to need recalling here) _A nation once again_ in
the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without
fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself.<eos>: 67.14537878736795
The Irish
Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were
heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only
our citizen can sing it.<eos>: 71.01675757390099
His superb highclass vocalism, which by its
superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was
vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be
noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives
of the press and the bar and the other learned professions.<eos>: 60.11178560744037
The
proceedings then terminated.

Amongst the clergy present were the very rev.<eos>: 26.666172084460815

—Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that
Keogh-Bennett match?

—No, says Joe.

—I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.

—Who?<eos>: 59.36428564357754
Blazes?<eos>: 10.269253485822038
says Joe.

And says Bloom:

—What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training
the eye.

—Ay, Blazes, says Alf.<eos>: 28.546762287673687
He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up
the odds and he swatting all the time.

—We know him, says the citizen.<eos>: 27.02827781970717
The traitor’s son.<eos>: 4.445711783667959
We know what put
English gold in his pocket.

—True for you, says Joe.

And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the
blood, asking Alf:

—Now, don’t you think, Bergan?

—Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf.<eos>: 45.73528020935803
Heenan and Sayers was only
a bloody fool to it.<eos>: 41.447617544798845
Handed him the father and mother of a beating.<eos>: 52.27884867518095
See
the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping.<eos>: 30.50472919656686
God,
he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made
him puke what he never ate.

It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were
scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns.
Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin’s pet lamb made up
for it by superlative skill in ringcraft.<eos>: 66.5262639971763
The final bout of fireworks
was a gruelling for both champions.<eos>: 42.47571999147054
The welterweight sergeantmajor had
tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had
been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in
some neat work on the pet’s nose, and Myler came on looking groggy.<eos>: 64.1724970459347
The
soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which
the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the
point of Bennett’s jaw.<eos>: 90.0996788493094
The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him
with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one.<eos>: 68.2179795743131
The men came to
handigrips.<eos>: 16.32171354436845
Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout
ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him.<eos>: 83.03887742433523
The
Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he
was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey
and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in
jigtime.<eos>: 66.84664154778666
It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it.<eos>: 35.07823164904253
The two
fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high.<eos>: 169.8480452626798
The referee twice
cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his
footwork a treat to watch.<eos>: 89.07750274892092
After a brisk exchange of courtesies during
which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from
his opponent’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and
landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett’s stomach, flooring him
flat.<eos>: 92.14335177959589
It was a knockout clean and clever.<eos>: 22.003817947672825
Amid tense expectation the
Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett’s second Ole
Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared
victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the
ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.

—He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf.<eos>: 50.154577590470744
I hear he’s
running a concert tour now up in the north.

—He is, says Joe.<eos>: 29.01229760348159
Isn’t he?

—Who?<eos>: 9.861012409149305
says Bloom.<eos>: 4.147988611947647
Ah, yes.<eos>: 4.581381976819603
That’s quite true.<eos>: 11.021405463613378
Yes, a kind of summer
tour, you see.<eos>: 30.919556950422418
Just a holiday.

—Mrs B.<eos>: 18.668671948370523
is the bright particular star, isn’t she?<eos>: 38.699115088231174
says Joe.

—My wife?<eos>: 9.386541293219627
says Bloom.<eos>: 4.147988611947647

And lo, there entered one of the clan of the O’Molloy’s, a comely hero
of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty’s counsel learned
in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of
Lambert.

—Hello, Ned.

—Hello, Alf.

—Hello, Jack.

—Hello, Joe.

—God save you, says the citizen.

—Save you kindly, says J.<eos>: 45.92475514967791
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
What’ll it be, Ned?

—Half one, says Ned.

So J.<eos>: 28.113659894956292
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
ordered the drinks.

—Were you round at the court?<eos>: 50.59010915337925
says Joe.

—Yes, says J.<eos>: 4.335837131297713
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
He’ll square that, Ned, says he.

—Hope so, says Ned.

Now what were those two at?<eos>: 54.67396982044529
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
getting him off the grand jury list
and the other give him a leg over the stile.<eos>: 50.268451456143886
With his name in Stubbs’s.
Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their

Dunne, says he.<eos>: 8.860249341669853
Ay, and done says I.<eos>: 38.53150675905395
Gob, he’ll come home by weeping
cross one of those days, I’m thinking.

—Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there?<eos>: 49.78546550447672
says Alf.<eos>: 4.46707518789288
U.<eos>: 1.6621382579199797
p: up.

—Yes, says J.<eos>: 8.90759205997272
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
Looking for a private detective.

—Ay, says Ned.<eos>: 12.737394202694812
And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only
Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting
examined first.

—Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing.<eos>: 66.96115590825843
God, I’d give anything to
hear him before a judge and jury.

—Was it you did it, Alf?<eos>: 36.760259309208294
says Joe.<eos>: 3.3094739023780617
The truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.

—Me?<eos>: 62.861511537585876
says Alf.<eos>: 4.46707518789288
Don’t cast your nasturtiums on my character.

—Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence
against you.

—Of course an action would lie, says J.<eos>: 44.28160760873006
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
It implies that he is not
_compos mentis_.<eos>: 11.026160237650572
U.<eos>: 1.6621382579199797
p: up.

_—Compos_ your eye!<eos>: 19.79469438561157
says Alf, laughing.<eos>: 9.487140558218275
Do you know that he’s balmy?
Look at his head.<eos>: 22.250555087970916
Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat
on with a shoehorn.

—Yes, says J.<eos>: 15.448564636490552
J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an
indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.

—Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.

—Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.

—Pity about her, says the citizen.<eos>: 26.774168169070986
Or any other woman marries a half
and half.

—How half and half?<eos>: 102.22210019427573
says Bloom.<eos>: 4.147988611947647
Do you mean he...

—Half and half I mean, says the citizen.<eos>: 25.69767437442153
A fellow that’s neither fish
nor flesh.

—Nor good red herring, says Joe.

—That what’s I mean, says the citizen.<eos>: 41.05830885378823
A pishogue, if you know what
that is.

Begob I saw there was trouble coming.<eos>: 42.18717968589764
And Bloom explaining he meant on
account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old
stuttering fool.<eos>: 79.58068342192736
Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody
povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him,
bringing down the rain.<eos>: 105.58013103997669
And she with her nose cockahoop after she
married him because a cousin of his old fellow’s was pewopener to the
pope.<eos>: 72.90288625223623
Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney’s
moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal
Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street.
And who was he, tell us?<eos>: 34.203820365473405
A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven
shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding
defiance to the world.

—And moreover, says J.<eos>: 59.79275762987957
J., a postcard is publication.<eos>: 24.46256674858564
It was held to be
sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v.<eos>: 39.7073798930361
Hole.<eos>: 2.3024941721991814
In my
opinion an action might lie.

Six and eightpence, please.<eos>: 84.99629683581637
Who wants your opinion?<eos>: 37.09040603284715
Let us drink our
pints in peace.<eos>: 76.13096685208554
Gob, we won’t be let even do that much itself.

—Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.

—Good health, Ned, says J.<eos>: 29.723666006324216
J.

—-There he is again, says Joe.

—Where?<eos>: 14.911050252489897
says Alf.

And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter
and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in
as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a
secondhand coffin.

—How did that Canada swindle case go off?<eos>: 73.86751781226678
says Joe.

—Remanded, says J.<eos>: 4.71659904865359
J.

One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James
Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers
saying he’d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob.<eos>: 50.847717047198394
What?<eos>: 3.8546952873351206
Do you see
any green in the white of my eye?<eos>: 47.94199020527746
Course it was a bloody barney.<eos>: 33.49479422154839
What?
Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and
his own kidney too.<eos>: 31.568719588771987
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew
Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him,
swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.

—Who tried the case?<eos>: 58.81005839983055
says Joe.

—Recorder, says Ned.

—Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.

—Heart as big as a lion, says Ned.<eos>: 41.26482620453853
Tell him a tale of woe about arrears
of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he’ll dissolve
in tears on the bench.

—Ay, says Alf.<eos>: 43.810970016082706
Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn’t clap him in the dock
the other day for suing poor little Gumley that’s minding stones, for
the corporation there near Butt bridge.

And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:

—A most scandalous thing!<eos>: 90.83018913216014
This poor hardworking man!<eos>: 18.27124426710346
How many children?
Ten, did you say?

—Yes, your worship.<eos>: 34.782814460030295
And my wife has the typhoid.

—And the wife with typhoid fever!<eos>: 34.81444466509077
Scandalous!<eos>: 7.319116630703941
Leave the court
immediately, sir.<eos>: 27.178307209223473
No, sir, I’ll make no order for payment.<eos>: 31.885312539053615
How dare
you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order!<eos>: 53.287144361541834
A poor
hardworking industrious man!<eos>: 19.586624465021828
I dismiss the case.

And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and
in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity,
the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first
quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the
halls of law.<eos>: 57.602777713068924
There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave
his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the
probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first
chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and
final testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of
the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus
Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another.<eos>: 62.313261827890194
And to the solemn
court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer.<eos>: 180.03236358850845
And he sat
him there about the hour of five o’clock to administer the law of the
brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in
and for the county of the city of Dublin.<eos>: 48.60143886854697
And there sat with him the
high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of
the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen
and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of
Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the
tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte
and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and
true.<eos>: 30.05501135575897
And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should
well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined
between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and
true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss
the book.<eos>: 144.0100921127702
And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they
swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His
rightwiseness.<eos>: 70.35518962871207
And straightway the minions of the law led forth from
their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended
in consequence of information received.<eos>: 61.700929151356725
And they shackled him hand and
foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge
against him for he was a malefactor.

—Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland
filling the country with bugs.

So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe,
telling him he needn’t trouble about that little matter till the first
but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford.<eos>: 88.38589606910408
And so Joe swore high
and holy by this and by that he’d do the devil and all.

—Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have
repetition.<eos>: 68.21168621118302
That’s the whole secret.

—Rely on me, says Joe.

—Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland.<eos>: 17.500309735396154
We
want no more strangers in our house.

—O, I’m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom.<eos>: 27.458553546377434
It’s just that
Keyes, you see.

—Consider that done, says Joe.

—Very kind of you, says Bloom.

—The strangers, says the citizen.<eos>: 22.439983838785828
Our own fault.<eos>: 21.645620803241655
We let them come in.
We brought them in.<eos>: 50.913462729037626
The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon
robbers here.

—Decree _nisi,_ says J.<eos>: 20.38339127515972
J.

And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a
spider’s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling
after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite
and when.

—A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that’s what’s the cause of all
our misfortunes.

—And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_
with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.

—Give us a squint at her, says I.

And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows
off of Corny Kelleher.<eos>: 43.88213219417187

Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter
just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with
officer Taylor.

—O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!

—There’s hair, Joe, says I.<eos>: 43.839711605192925
Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off
of that one, what?

So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on
him as long as a late breakfast.

—Well, says the citizen, what’s the latest from the scene of action?
What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide
about the Irish language?

O’Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the
puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of
that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient
city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there,
after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken
solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once
more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided
Gael.

—It’s on the march, says the citizen.<eos>: 69.58097608287343
To hell with the bloody brutal
Sassenachs and their _patois._

So J.<eos>: 23.36710778399744
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till
you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting
your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to
impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and
botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.

—Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen.<eos>: 50.85117819841896
To hell with them!

Any civilisation they have they stole from us.
Tonguetied sons of bastards’ ghosts.

—The European family, says J.<eos>: 28.21475010051526
J....

—They’re not European, says the citizen.<eos>: 10.714895487466144
I was in Europe with Kevin
Egan of Paris.<eos>: 33.65912979861697
You wouldn’t see a trace of them or their language
anywhere in Europe except in a _cabinet d’aisance._

And says John Wyse:

—Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.

And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:

—_Conspuez les Anglais!<eos>: 49.77427958481197
Perfide Albion!_

He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the
medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh
Dearg Abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty
valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster
silent as the deathless gods.

—What’s up with you, says I to Lenehan.<eos>: 47.87850971695839
You look like a fellow that had
lost a bob and found a tanner.

—Gold cup, says he.

—Who won, Mr Lenehan?<eos>: 52.55542702847166
says Terry.

_—Throwaway,_ says he, at twenty to one.<eos>: 30.0975794211015
A rank outsider.<eos>: 35.20141473717301
And the rest
nowhere.

—And Bass’s mare?<eos>: 32.699617322217165
says Terry.

—Still running, says he.<eos>: 18.37632419575128
We’re all in a cart.<eos>: 10.565311748628162
Boylan plunged two quid

—I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on _Zinfandel_ that Mr Flynn

Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions.<eos>: 24.22914084902611
Frailty, thy

So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was
anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his
luck with his mangy snout up.<eos>: 70.21400076562179
Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.

—Not there, my child, says he.

—Keep your pecker up, says Joe.<eos>: 21.28072986172778
She’d have won the money only for the
other dog.

And J.<eos>: 40.41072957815672

and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom
sticking in an odd word.

—Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others’ eyes but they
can’t see the beam in their own.

—_Raimeis_, says the citizen.<eos>: 45.531725622315555

Where are our missing
twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost
tribes?<eos>: 140.99751641517958
And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world!
And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax
and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our
tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our
Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk
and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite
convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world.<eos>: 70.8964695692318

What do the yellowjohns of
Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths?<eos>: 98.54630909684236
And the beds
of the Barrow and Shannon they won’t deepen with millions of acres of
marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?

—As treeless as Portugal we’ll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland
with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land.
Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast.<eos>: 54.941541107983035
I
was reading a report of lord Castletown’s...

—Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain
elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage.<eos>: 29.67696857467975
Save the
trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of

at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief

Valley.<eos>: 81.49574094531782

Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence.<eos>: 17.754901476247944
The bride who was
given away by her father, the M’Conifer of the Glands, looked
exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised
silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of
broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe,
the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn
bronze.<eos>: 85.45949975603315
The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce
Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same
tone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a
pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form
of heron feathers of paletinted coral.<eos>: 43.824144750453186
Senhor Enrique Flor presided at
the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed
numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of
_Woodman, spare that tree_ at the conclusion of the service.<eos>: 45.64593844907804
On leaving
the church of Saint Fiacre _in Horto_ after the papal blessing the
happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts,
beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries,
mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots.<eos>: 16.866179405935394
Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan
will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.

—And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen.<eos>: 58.38608383536159
We had our trade with
Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were
pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.

—And will again, says Joe.

—And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the
citizen, clapping his thigh.<eos>: 46.278420556095426
Our harbours that are empty will be full
again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom
of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a
fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O’Reillys and the
O’Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with
the emperor Charles the Fifth himself.<eos>: 42.42246088770476
And will again, says he, when
the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own
flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor’s harps, no, the oldest flag
afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns
on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.

And he took the last swig out of the pint.<eos>: 38.95843219829457
Moya.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
All wind and piss like
a tanyard cat.<eos>: 22.923152622760306
Cows in Connacht have long horns.<eos>: 69.85792920160031
As much as his bloody
life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled
multitude in Shanagolden where he daren’t show his nose with the Molly
Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the
holding of an evicted tenant.

—Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse.<eos>: 66.79188907932598
What will you have?

—An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.

—Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up.<eos>: 27.019000411382812
Terry!<eos>: 10.554742976194287
Are you
asleep?

—Yes, sir, says Terry.<eos>: 11.995430119742203
Small whisky and bottle of Allsop.<eos>: 21.95524245258508
Right, sir.

Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead
of attending to the general public.<eos>: 121.22545130870235
Picture of a butting match, trying
to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his
head down like a bull at a gate.<eos>: 74.54502500384768
And another one: _Black Beast Burned
in Omaha, Ga_.<eos>: 48.97913519572413
A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing
at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under
him.<eos>: 27.222619102269743
Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and
crucify him to make sure of their job.

—But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at
bay?

—I’ll tell you what about it, says the citizen.<eos>: 34.62909658407132
Hell upon earth it is.
Read the revelations that’s going on in the papers about flogging on
the training ships at Portsmouth.<eos>: 53.46080128547809
A fellow writes that calls himself
_Disgusted One_.

So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of
tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the
parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad
brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend
of a gun.

—A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John
Beresford called it but the modern God’s Englishman calls it caning on
the breech.

And says John Wyse:

—’Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.

Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane
and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad
till he yells meila murder.

—That’s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the
earth.<eos>: 67.51512731714955
The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary
chamber on the face of God’s earth and their land in the hands of a
dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons.<eos>: 45.112242834282014
That’s the great empire they
boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.

—On which the sun never rises, says Joe.

—And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it.<eos>: 28.42946931856217
The
unfortunate yahoos believe it.

They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth,
and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast,
born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was
scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day
he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend
till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be
paid.

—But, says Bloom, isn’t discipline the same everywhere.<eos>: 63.68685950637212
I mean wouldn’t
it be the same here if you put force against force?

Didn’t I tell you?<eos>: 50.635404813753574
As true as I’m drinking this porter if he was at his
last gasp he’d try to downface you that dying was living.

—We’ll put force against force, says the citizen.<eos>: 41.31047805969885
We have our greater
Ireland beyond the sea.<eos>: 57.81384219968057
They were driven out of house and home in the
black 47.<eos>: 26.380480810134376
Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid
low by the batteringram and the _Times_ rubbed its hands and told the
whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as
redskins in America.<eos>: 50.73591898203805
Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres.<eos>: 30.2058297712486
But the
Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of
crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro.<eos>: 52.03699320310556
Ay,
they drove out the peasants in hordes.<eos>: 27.88562077945859
Twenty thousand of them died in
the coffinships.<eos>: 37.48869643840479
But those that came to the land of the free remember
the land of bondage.<eos>: 51.86095590597425
And they will come again and with a vengeance, no
cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.

—Perfectly true, says Bloom.<eos>: 17.855399481444945
But my point was...

—We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned.<eos>: 31.512739373150033
Since the
poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at
Killala.

—Ay, says John Wyse.<eos>: 28.380570823119847
We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us
against the Williamites and they betrayed us.<eos>: 39.15839239654394
Remember Limerick and the
broken treatystone.<eos>: 26.043014929747155
We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the
wild geese.<eos>: 68.63448131841673
Fontenoy, eh?<eos>: 9.881490272746777
And Sarsfield and O’Donnell, duke of Tetuan
in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria
Teresa.<eos>: 29.842788788105416
But what did we ever get for it?

—The French!<eos>: 28.561723651125263
says the citizen.<eos>: 2.9170734307608264
Set of dancing masters!<eos>: 104.25428291605482
Do you know what
it is?<eos>: 9.604512295979715
They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland.<eos>: 25.599473564841006
Aren’t they
trying to make an _Entente cordiale_ now at Tay Pay’s dinnerparty with
perfidious Albion?<eos>: 32.191161003505115
Firebrands of Europe and they always were.

—_Conspuez les Français_, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.

—And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven’t we
had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George
the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that’s
dead?

Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old
one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every
night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman
carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by
the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _Ehren on the
Rhine_ and come where the boose is cheaper.

—Well, says J.<eos>: 56.95560438783239
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
We have Edward the peacemaker now.

—Tell that to a fool, says the citizen.<eos>: 28.608227135732673
There’s a bloody sight more pox
than pax about that boyo.<eos>: 29.34295956628651
Edward Guelph-Wettin!

—And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and
bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic
Majesty’s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his
jockeys rode.<eos>: 63.066845070779536
The earl of Dublin, no less.

—They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little
Alf.

And says J.<eos>: 49.27441487829307
J.:

—Considerations of space influenced their lordships’ decision.

—Will you try another, citizen?<eos>: 54.58685969788541
says Joe.

—Yes, sir, says he.<eos>: 4.520755211727558
I will.

—You?<eos>: 14.729448123307892
says Joe.

—Beholden to you, Joe, says I.<eos>: 8.50655989569216
May your shadow never grow less.

—Repeat that dose, says Joe.

Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with
his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling
about.

—Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.
Perpetuating national hatred among nations.

—But do you know what a nation means?<eos>: 45.77614658557597
says John Wyse.

—Yes, says Bloom.

—What is it?<eos>: 6.613963356400657
says John Wyse.

—A nation?<eos>: 13.242442407266777
says Bloom.<eos>: 4.147988611947647
A nation is the same people living in the same
place.

—By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that’s so I’m a nation for I’m
living in the same place for the past five years.

So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to
muck out of it:

—Or also living in different places.

—That covers my case, says Joe.

—What is your nation if I may ask?<eos>: 42.343596032827186
says the citizen.

—Ireland, says Bloom.<eos>: 7.854308954659838
I was born here.<eos>: 12.405309672851653
Ireland.

The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and,
gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.

—After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to
swab himself dry.

—Here you are, citizen, says Joe.<eos>: 54.39125367712706
Take that in your right hand and
repeat after me the following words.

The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth
attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh,
authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and
called forth prolonged admiration.<eos>: 39.68610960519533
No need to dwell on the legendary
beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly
discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the
four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American
puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said
in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill.<eos>: 78.33462826628627
The
scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and
raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive
stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as
when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy
long long ago in the time of the Barmecides.<eos>: 53.822443877127846
Glendalough, the lovely
lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh
and the Twelve Pins, Ireland’s Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh
Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company
(Limited), Lough Neagh’s banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde’s tower, the
Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun’s hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of
Aherlow, Lynch’s castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at
Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids,
Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury’s Hotel, S.
Patrick’s Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory,
Curley’s hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington,
the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse,
Fingal’s Cave—all these moving scenes are still there for us today
rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed
over them and by the rich incrustations of time.

—Show us over the drink, says I.<eos>: 41.559061290516716
Which is which?

—That’s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.

—And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.
Also now.<eos>: 27.91827954808353
This very moment.<eos>: 16.01534255627006
This very instant.

Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.

—Robbed, says he.<eos>: 42.94632529999349
Plundered.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Insulted.<eos>: 4.692764147788831
Persecuted.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Taking what belongs
to us by right.<eos>: 34.94556167790097
At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold
by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.

—Are you talking about the new Jerusalem?<eos>: 61.18187046855504
says the citizen.

—I’m talking about injustice, says Bloom.

—Right, says John Wyse.<eos>: 8.08485940842224
Stand up to it then with force like men.

That’s an almanac picture for you.<eos>: 49.624345699880344
Mark for a softnosed bullet.<eos>: 5.969324859294486
Old
lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun.<eos>: 30.707939173152894
Gob, he’d adorn a
sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse’s apron on him.<eos>: 28.513542391913926
And
then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as
limp as a wet rag.

—But it’s no use, says he.<eos>: 48.30247322630657
Force, hatred, history, all that.<eos>: 19.25698807983707
That’s not
life for men and women, insult and hatred.<eos>: 21.253322032885407
And everybody knows that
it’s the very opposite of that that is really life.

—What?<eos>: 45.43691451877174
says Alf.

—Love, says Bloom.<eos>: 9.280065054681803
I mean the opposite of hatred.<eos>: 23.627634130917013
I must go now, says
he to John Wyse.<eos>: 28.782895515413095
Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is
there.<eos>: 70.13885364292356
If he comes just say I’ll be back in a second.<eos>: 35.59972388270236
Just a moment.

Who’s hindering you?<eos>: 19.27287575655285
And off he pops like greased lightning.

—A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen.<eos>: 21.92917747586347
Universal love.

—Well, says John Wyse.<eos>: 9.992405888346493
Isn’t that what we’re told.<eos>: 16.177090620890056
Love your neighbour.

—That chap?<eos>: 41.8465794753349
says the citizen.<eos>: 2.9170734307608264
Beggar my neighbour is his motto.<eos>: 21.56053752743459
Love,
moya!<eos>: 5.495565728897058
He’s a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.

Love loves to love love.<eos>: 37.604112430823264
Nurse loves the new chemist.<eos>: 41.91003375968343

Mrs Norman W.<eos>: 24.268981808059305
Tupper loves officer Taylor.
You love a certain person.<eos>: 123.3000496361104
And this person loves that other person
because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.

—Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song.<eos>: 119.76691155782761
More power,
citizen.

—Hurrah, there, says Joe.

—The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.

And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.

—We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket.
What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women
and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text _God is love_
pasted round the mouth of his cannon?<eos>: 44.68916377028147
The bible!<eos>: 28.91894241016601
Did you read that skit
in the _United Irishman_ today about that Zulu chief that’s visiting
England?

—What’s that?<eos>: 27.01947693569859
says Joe.

So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts
reading out:

—A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented
yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in
Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the
heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in
his dominions.<eos>: 59.52865936060121
The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of
which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely
translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod
Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the
cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire,
stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an
illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of
England’s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief
woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the
august hand of the Royal Donor.<eos>: 43.03687446570453
The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of
firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of
his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty
Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and
signed his mark in the visitors’ book, subsequently executing a
charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed
several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.

—Widow woman, says Ned.<eos>: 43.04677628571273
I wouldn’t doubt her.<eos>: 13.777803093950485
Wonder did he put that
bible to the same use as I would.

—Same only more so, says Lenehan.<eos>: 57.206548183425554
And thereafter in that fruitful land
the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.

—Is that by Griffith?<eos>: 23.89109230817909
says John Wyse.

—No, says the citizen.<eos>: 5.816253795121911
It’s not signed Shanganagh.<eos>: 20.319286588259285
It’s only
initialled: P.

—And a very good initial too, says Joe.

—That’s how it’s worked, says the citizen.<eos>: 20.202163460486133
Trade follows the flag.

—Well, says J.<eos>: 21.3486949578884
J., if they’re any worse than those Belgians in the
Congo Free State they must be bad.<eos>: 52.39573971036973
Did you read that report by a man
what’s this his name is?

—Casement, says the citizen.<eos>: 28.248490012714406
He’s an Irishman.

—Yes, that’s the man, says J.<eos>: 11.030172136654707
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
Raping the women and girls and
flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they
can out of them.

—I know where he’s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.

—Who?<eos>: 42.514619633519125
says I.

—Bloom, says he.<eos>: 8.21800055236679
The courthouse is a blind.<eos>: 13.322496038072405
He had a few bob on
_Throwaway_ and he’s gone to gather in the shekels.

—Is it that whiteeyed kaffir?<eos>: 23.480525964196723
says the citizen, that never backed a
horse in anger in his life?

—That’s where he’s gone, says Lenehan.<eos>: 18.58819964123235
I met Bantam Lyons going to back
that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.
Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on.<eos>: 81.58466839044642
He’s the
only man in Dublin has it.<eos>: 32.378340299962375
A dark horse.

—He’s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.

—Mind, Joe, says I.<eos>: 19.468683000778217
Show us the entrance out.

—There you are, says Terry.

Goodbye Ireland I’m going to Gort.<eos>: 38.001925912252204
So I just went round the back of the
yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was
letting off my _(Throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says I
to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in
Slattery’s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings
is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was
telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have
done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she’s
better_ or _she’s_ (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool
if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!)
Ireland my nation says he (hoik!<eos>: 148.72420449171003
phthook!) never be up to those bloody
(there’s the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.

So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it
was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper
all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off

Gob, he’s like Lanty MacHale’s goat that’d go a piece of the
road with every one.

—Well, it’s a fact, says John Wyse.<eos>: 22.1022734712495
And there’s the man now that’ll
tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.

Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power
with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the
collector general’s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the
registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the
country at the king’s expense.

Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their
palfreys.

—Ho, varlet!<eos>: 59.07196648223643
cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.
Saucy knave!<eos>: 49.00114750488735
To us!

So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.

Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.

—Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.

—Bestir thyself, sirrah!<eos>: 39.28097015172912
cried he who had knocked.<eos>: 39.95982288758734
Look to our steeds.
And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.

—Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare
larder.<eos>: 71.42142863015981
I know not what to offer your lordships.

—How now, fellow?<eos>: 36.708537522544596
cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant
countenance, So servest thou the king’s messengers, master Taptun?

An instantaneous change overspread the landlord’s visage.

—Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly.<eos>: 49.608689432773104
An you be the king’s
messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught.<eos>: 63.719181359344205
The
king’s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my
house I warrant me.

—Then about!<eos>: 77.39828482911304
cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty
trencherman by his aspect.<eos>: 34.33170406940452
Hast aught to give us?

Mine host bowed again as he made answer:

—What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of
venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog’s bacon, a boar’s
head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a
flagon of old Rhenish?

—Gadzooks!<eos>: 31.71926632642458
cried the last speaker.<eos>: 13.456230107762565
That likes me well.<eos>: 22.10948520680657
Pistachios!

—Aha!<eos>: 18.460070995861113
cried he of the pleasant countenance.<eos>: 42.56561284808325
A poor house and a bare
larder, quotha!<eos>: 31.740528038546476
’Tis a merry rogue.

So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.

—Where is he?<eos>: 63.276164625738495
says Lenehan.<eos>: 5.850907249031271
Defrauding widows and orphans.

—Isn’t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen
about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?

—That’s so, says Martin.<eos>: 23.8234598078711
Or so they allege.

—Who made those allegations?<eos>: 27.40061046348955
says Alf.

—I, says Joe.<eos>: 6.592727577198942
I’m the alligator.

—And after all, says John Wyse, why can’t a jew love his country like
the next fellow?

—Why not?<eos>: 30.63841364029456
says J.<eos>: 3.1727128184443183
J., when he’s quite sure which country it is.

—Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the
hell is he?<eos>: 45.70003224715341
says Ned.<eos>: 6.790954311773389
Or who is he?<eos>: 13.433593821925617
No offence, Crofton.

—Who is Junius?<eos>: 24.840994280189083
says J.<eos>: 3.1727128184443183
J.

—We don’t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.

—He’s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was
he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system.<eos>: 29.372668364908538
We know
that in the castle.

—Isn’t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist?<eos>: 25.18791015946989
says Jack Power.

—Not at all, says Martin.<eos>: 22.843579783110467
Only namesakes.<eos>: 4.1424831571082095
His name was Virag, the
father’s name that poisoned himself.<eos>: 40.18481939158991
He changed it by deedpoll, the
father did.

—That’s the new Messiah for Ireland!<eos>: 37.40513545592774
says the citizen.<eos>: 2.9170734307608264
Island of saints
and sages!

—Well, they’re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin.<eos>: 28.572780144726227
For that
matter so are we.

—Yes, says J.<eos>: 18.298955886917067
J., and every male that’s born they think it may be their
Messiah.<eos>: 103.67240895607853
And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe,
till he knows if he’s a father or a mother.

—Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.

—O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his
that died was born.<eos>: 56.456334234780975
I met him one day in the south city markets buying
a tin of Neave’s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.

—_En ventre sa mère_, says J.<eos>: 44.62051213638129
J.

—Do you call that a man?<eos>: 13.377582737616576
says the citizen.

—I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.

—Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.

—And who does he suspect?<eos>: 30.920331028746155
says the citizen.

Gob, there’s many a true word spoken in jest.<eos>: 28.378884772770434
One of those mixed
middlings he is.<eos>: 31.665888777389405
Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a
month with headache like a totty with her courses.<eos>: 70.757442716954
Do you know what I’m
telling you?<eos>: 10.645995693807409
It’d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like
of that and throw him in the bloody sea.<eos>: 61.91757720673901
Justifiable homicide, so it
would.<eos>: 16.594499788469946
Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of
stuff like a man.<eos>: 116.09275828026776
Give us your blessing.<eos>: 22.46573560051372
Not as much as would blind
your eye.

—Charity to the neighbour, says Martin.<eos>: 44.09202714023342
But where is he?<eos>: 10.075514213368068
We can’t wait.

—A wolf in sheep’s clothing, says the citizen.<eos>: 13.485401473477284
That’s what he is.<eos>: 8.856671350960697
Virag
from Hungary!<eos>: 38.964622293590345
Ahasuerus I call him.<eos>: 15.41623018913864
Cursed by God.

—Have you time for a brief libation, Martin?<eos>: 43.98078870554851
says Ned.

—Only one, says Martin.<eos>: 14.925815758638821
We must be quick.<eos>: 19.088567709373027
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
and S.

—You, Jack?<eos>: 18.82854659317158
Crofton?<eos>: 14.806667383732131
Three half ones, Terry.

—Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us,
says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our
shores.

—Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass.<eos>: 52.9493510028955
God bless all here is my
prayer.

—Amen, says the citizen.

—And I’m sure He will, says Joe.

And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with
acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and
subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors
and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto,
Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and
Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines,
Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter
Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet
led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and
friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers,
minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of
Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks
of S.<eos>: 20.38204102495483

And all came
with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords
and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of
their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes,
trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys,
dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives,
soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches,
forceps, stags’ horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a
dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns.<eos>: 12.599002709420514
And as they wended their way
by Nelson’s Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little
Britain street chanting the introit in _Epiphania Domini_ which
beginneth _Surge, illuminare_ and thereafter most sweetly the gradual
_Omnes_ which saith _de Saba venient_ they did divers wonders such as
casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes,
healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had
been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and
prophesying.<eos>: 53.082193733984695
And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the
reverend Father O’Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick.<eos>: 109.46120679220878
And when the
good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard
Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale
grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for the sale of beer, wine
and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the
house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults
and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and
the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the
lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that
house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and
make the angels of His light to inhabit therein.<eos>: 39.60346774334102
And entering he
blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed
answered his prayers.

—_Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini._

—_Qui fecit cœlum et terram._

—_Dominus vobiscum._

—_Et cum spiritu tuo._

And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he
prayed and they all with him prayed:

—_Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde
super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et
voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem
sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animæ tutelam Te auctore
percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum._

—And so say all of us, says Jack.

—Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.

—Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson.<eos>: 27.276563716352733
And butter for fish.

I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike
when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a
hurry.

—I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you.<eos>: 77.48292527849861
I hope
I’m not...

—No, says Martin, we’re ready.

Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.
Mean bloody scut.<eos>: 45.69052065361524
Stand us a drink itself.<eos>: 46.40340220121298
Devil a sweet fear!<eos>: 76.53348985304173
There’s
a jew for you!<eos>: 20.623823172448418
All for number one.<eos>: 33.83937958885864
Cute as a shithouse rat.<eos>: 19.836723295256775
Hundred to
five.

—Don’t tell anyone, says the citizen.

—Beg your pardon, says he.

—Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue.<eos>: 27.85759014002727
Come along now.

—Don’t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him.<eos>: 18.197427865299893
It’s a
secret.

And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.

—Bye bye all, says Martin.

And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or
whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be
all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.

—Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.

The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop
the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off
forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard.<eos>: 53.56153232612591
A many comely
nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the
sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the
cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the
equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds
them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas
they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair.<eos>: 79.5540554255744
Even so
did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters.
And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark
clave the waves.

But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the
citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the
dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and
candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little
Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.

—Let me alone, says he.

And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls
out of him:

—Three cheers for Israel!

Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ’ sake
and don’t be making a public exhibition of yourself.<eos>: 55.363828867274194
Jesus, there’s
always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about
bloody nothing.<eos>: 126.01315066790454
Gob, it’d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it
would.

And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and
Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and
Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews
and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him
to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a
patch over his eye starts singing _If the man in the moon was a jew,
jew, jew_ and a slut shouts out of her:

—Eh, mister!<eos>: 73.06179149883047
Your fly is open, mister!

And says he:

—Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza.<eos>: 29.238735393956915
And
the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew.<eos>: 19.285386960006146
Your God.

—He had no father, says Martin.<eos>: 23.618951991284113
That’ll do now.<eos>: 12.709344187538928
Drive ahead.

—Whose God?<eos>: 47.20317387664609
says the citizen.

—Well, his uncle was a jew, says he.<eos>: 14.198904411173025
Your God was a jew.<eos>: 11.815382037986264
Christ was a
jew like me.

Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.

—By Jesus, says he, I’ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy
name.<eos>: 30.744662627789154
By Jesus, I’ll crucify him so I will.<eos>: 14.348142748446875
Give us that biscuitbox here.

—Stop!<eos>: 20.40291019829515
Stop!<eos>: 6.676053278968138
says Joe.

A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from
the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid
farewell to Nagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander
Thom’s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for
the distant clime of Százharminczbrojúgulyás-Dugulás (Meadow of
Murmuring Waters).<eos>: 62.77025376347065
The ceremony which went off with great _éclat_ was
characterised by the most affecting cordiality.<eos>: 28.41924460679649
An illuminated scroll
of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to
the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the
community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket,
tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work
which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob.
The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of
those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of
Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_,
followed immediately by _Rakóczsy’s March_.<eos>: 44.60287213775997
Tarbarrels and bonfires
were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the
Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains
of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the
Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of
M’Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom.<eos>: 23.501789975408798
Amid
cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a
big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills,
the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final
floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were
present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river,
escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and
Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical
power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.
_Visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom!<eos>: 62.73085863312017
Visszontlátásra!_ Gone but not
forgotten.

Gob, the devil wouldn’t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin
anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he
shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen’s
royal theatre:

—Where is he till I murder him?

And Ned and J.<eos>: 92.96318903995677
J.<eos>: 1.4863948174256094
paralysed with the laughing.

—Bloody wars, says I, I’ll be in for the last gospel.

But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag’s head round the other
way and off with him.

—Hold on, citizen, says Joe.<eos>: 39.958208993818786
Stop!

Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly.<eos>: 58.26178115788374
Mercy of God the
sun was in his eyes or he’d have left him for dead.<eos>: 45.95135499488492
Gob, he near sent
it into the county Longford.<eos>: 29.797620201990046
The bloody nag took fright and the old
mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting
and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.

The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect.<eos>: 79.10591261144089
The
observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the
fifth grade of Mercalli’s scale, and there is no record extant of a
similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534,
the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas.<eos>: 43.19459351347585
The epicentre appears to
have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn’s Quay
ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres,
two roods and one square pole or perch.<eos>: 52.53581829107138
All the lordly residences in
the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble
edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal
debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it
is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive.<eos>: 65.05477830626452
From the
reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were
accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic
character.<eos>: 30.347568188255853
An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the
much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a
silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat
of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of
quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been
discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island
respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant’s
causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in
the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale.<eos>: 74.74374778382843
Other
eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of
enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying
velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west.<eos>: 27.145457274765008
Messages of
condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the
different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously
pleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_ shall be
celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral
church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority
of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who
have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst.<eos>: 70.15486480471432
The work of
salvage, removal of _débris,_ human remains etc has been entrusted to
Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T.

Gob, if he got that
lottery ticket on the side of his poll he’d remember the gold cup, he
would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and

The jarvey saved his life by
furious driving as sure as God made Moses.<eos>: 239.60649548747733
What?<eos>: 3.8546952873351206
O, Jesus, he did.<eos>: 15.489584901252728
And
he let a volley of oaths after him.

—Did I kill him, says he, or what?

And he shouting to the bloody dog:

—After him, Garry!<eos>: 36.521923964975116
After him, boy!

And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old
sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his
lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb.
Hundred to five!<eos>: 117.49491060556396
Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise
you.

When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld
the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven.<eos>: 68.34305619424279
And they beheld Him in
the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having
raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they
durst not look upon Him.<eos>: 60.409485647226326
And there came a voice out of heaven, calling:
_Elijah!<eos>: 50.58596887285005
Elijah!_ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba!<eos>: 40.264381067698885
Adonai!_ And
they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels
ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees
over Donohoe’s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.




[ 13 ]


The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious
embrace.<eos>: 88.11167918934585
Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of
all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud
promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on
the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on
the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the
stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a
beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.

The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening
scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly.<eos>: 103.39628489625711
Many a time and
oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy
chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy
Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and
Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits
with caps to match and the name _H.<eos>: 83.65710456959319
M.<eos>: 2.1967246080865164
S.<eos>: 4.405906724215668
Belleisle_ printed on both.
For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very
noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little
fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them.<eos>: 228.1218342606794
They
were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building
castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy
as the day was long.<eos>: 100.68979708270041
And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to
and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with
delight.<eos>: 72.83476372635188
He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a
tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words.<eos>: 81.06170800574111
Cissy
Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty
dimple in his chin.

—Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said.<eos>: 35.16745032615258
Say out big, big.<eos>: 105.20381804077775
I want a drink of
water.

And baby prattled after her:

—A jink a jink a jawbo.

Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of
children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could
never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that
held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown
bread with golden syrup on.<eos>: 78.29103269533543
What a persuasive power that girl had!<eos>: 132.14072797709977
But
to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in
his new fancy bib.<eos>: 52.79482456005265
None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort,
was Cissy Caffrey.<eos>: 54.988678401238346
A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life,
always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her
cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme.<eos>: 46.161086250290595
And Edy Boardman
laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.

But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and
Master Jacky.<eos>: 131.27623251673862
Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to
this golden rule.<eos>: 97.51107175532243
The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand
which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go
wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like
the Martello tower had.<eos>: 76.23855675820933
But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky
was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman’s
house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose
that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the
coveted castle too.<eos>: 75.01078517559365
Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master
Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.

—Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively.<eos>: 71.64513318275584
At once!<eos>: 17.34545569653636
And you,
Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand.<eos>: 82.1977990106792
Wait till I
catch you for that.

His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for
their big sister’s word was law with the twins.<eos>: 93.79790488506139
And in a sad plight he
was too after his misadventure.<eos>: 32.28904463837147
His little man-o’-war top and
unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the
art of smoothing over life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one
speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit.<eos>: 124.19412613554772
Still the blue
eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed
away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and
said if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him, her eyes dancing
in admonition.

—Nasty bold Jacky!<eos>: 113.31174474890872
she cried.

She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:

—What’s your name?<eos>: 23.054664995142062
Butter and cream?

—Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman.<eos>: 63.79773815041619
Is Cissy your
sweetheart?

—Nao, tearful Tommy said.

—Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart?<eos>: 45.52782419833937
Cissy queried.

—Nao, Tommy said.

—I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from
her shortsighted eyes.<eos>: 36.53012383331133
I know who is Tommy’s sweetheart.<eos>: 25.573088677502472
Gerty is
Tommy’s sweetheart.

—Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.

Cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy
Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman
couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes.

But who was Gerty?

Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought,
gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a
specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see.<eos>: 66.92610330855089
She was
pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said,
she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell.<eos>: 75.68938239494891
Her figure was slight and
graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had
been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the
Widow Welch’s female pills and she was much better of those discharges
she used to get and that tired feeling.<eos>: 126.98289163490496
The waxen pallor of her face
was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth
was a genuine Cupid’s bow, Greekly perfect.<eos>: 49.84190499395452
Her hands were of finely
veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and
queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used
to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either.<eos>: 103.13989258606291
Bertha Supple
told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black
out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their
little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told
her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or
she’d never speak to her again.<eos>: 93.02028942988576
No.<eos>: 5.3673087592043816
Honour where honour is due.<eos>: 99.52080608098434
There
was an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which
was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.
Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in
her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education
Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the
land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow
and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their
devoirs to her.<eos>: 69.08871430255378
Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that
lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed
meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful
eyes, a charm few could resist.<eos>: 101.6955935180399
Why have women such eyes of witchery?
Gerty’s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and
dark expressive brows.<eos>: 95.16316688240062
Time was when those brows were not so silkily
seductive.<eos>: 65.72276392932365
It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful
page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try
eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so
becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it.<eos>: 65.49044331222943
Then
there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase
your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose?<eos>: 169.80759213660926
That would
suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one.<eos>: 110.64012705725736
But Gerty’s crowning
glory was her wealth of wonderful hair.<eos>: 57.807779179515485
It was dark brown with a
natural wave in it.<eos>: 78.53831732315055
She had cut it that very morning on account of the
new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of
luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth.<eos>: 53.371094693837875
And
just now at Edy’s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest
rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet
girlish shyness that of a surety God’s fair land of Ireland did not
hold her equal.

For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes.<eos>: 80.77205109092978
She was
about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.
Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.
The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out
into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young
May morning.<eos>: 91.2564039621882
She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy
say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a
lovers’ quarrel.<eos>: 77.60273936928012
As per usual somebody’s nose was out of joint about
the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding
up and down in front of her window.<eos>: 105.59887561250854
Only now his father kept him in in
the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate
that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a
doctor when he left the high school like his brother W.<eos>: 86.65690227018862
E.<eos>: 1.5381861561152315
Wylie who
was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university.<eos>: 122.75822880149474
Little
recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart
sometimes, piercing to the core.<eos>: 75.54202996147295
Yet he was young and perchance he
might learn to love her in time.<eos>: 51.55811227300441
They were protestants in his family
and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed
Virgin and then Saint Joseph.<eos>: 114.87886202779845
But he was undeniably handsome with an
exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the
shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would
know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the
bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice
perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size
too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so
frightfully clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front
of her bit of a garden.

Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of
Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be
out.<eos>: 95.23082720272778
A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because
it was expected in the _Lady’s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be
worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket
(in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her
favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy
threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful
figure to perfection.<eos>: 143.30624371259228
She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of
wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue
chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone.<eos>: 61.917077957663665
All Tuesday
week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she
found what she wanted at Clery’s summer sales, the very it, slightly
shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny.
She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on
then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to
her!<eos>: 166.97875205744157
And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew
that that would take the shine out of some people she knew.<eos>: 51.61918023535105
Her shoes
were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she
was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a
five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one
smart buckle over her higharched instep.<eos>: 88.95576888001635
Her wellturned ankle displayed
its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount
and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with
highspliced heels and wide garter tops.<eos>: 105.94792022295276
As for undies they were Gerty’s
chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet
seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in
his heart to blame her?<eos>: 120.25155088492018
She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty
stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with
different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen,
and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the
wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because
she wouldn’t trust those washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching
the things.<eos>: 61.95895653141212
She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her
own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on
her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his
father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and
because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was
dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside
out and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things
on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so
long as it wasn’t of a Friday.

And yet and yet!<eos>: 128.27830517711257
That strained look on her face!<eos>: 44.187724419216714
A gnawing sorrow is
there all the time.<eos>: 19.904701275513133
Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give
worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving
way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings
though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the
mirror.<eos>: 94.31070509670215
You are lovely, Gerty, it said.<eos>: 31.16348509249739
The paly light of evening falls
upon a face infinitely sad and wistful.<eos>: 102.07692542044907
Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.
Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage
has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.
C.<eos>: 107.78241725104387
D.<eos>: 5.129374379987754
(because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs
Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was
wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox
was not to be.<eos>: 111.11142863116919
He was too young to understand.<eos>: 38.22668476804003
He would not believe in
love, a woman’s birthright.<eos>: 17.234950455716525
The night of the party long ago in Stoer’s
(he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an
arm round her waist she went white to the very lips.<eos>: 80.16891659878335
He called her
little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the
first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from
the room with a remark about refreshments.<eos>: 52.254606639233636
Impetuous fellow!<eos>: 35.47191730385974
Strength
of character had never been Reggy Wylie’s strong point and he who would
woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men.<eos>: 135.1817661443377
But waiting,
always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be
over.<eos>: 138.0534104379473
No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous
love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who
had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey,
and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her
to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort
her with a long long kiss.<eos>: 139.09310550711626
It would be like heaven.<eos>: 27.666645522086043
For such a one she
yearns this balmy summer eve.<eos>: 103.56792477183348
With all the heart of her she longs to be
his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in
health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.

And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was
just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his
little wife to be.<eos>: 121.1836872772215
Then they could talk about her till they went blue
in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she
would be twentytwo in November.<eos>: 69.71627412702884
She would care for him with creature
comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked
that feeling of hominess.<eos>: 127.42903367373758
Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue
and queen Ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden
opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a
fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same
direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of
eggs though she didn’t like the eating part when there were any people
that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something
poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully
appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph
of grandpapa Giltrap’s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was
so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in
Clery’s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses.<eos>: 110.7986802148019
He would be
tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a
husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed
sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their
honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in
a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both
have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and
before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a
good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.

Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then
she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run
off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight.<eos>: 114.52908226301547
But Tommy
said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with
the ball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but Tommy said
it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if
you please.<eos>: 58.53549697777217
The temper of him!<eos>: 28.23251610738089
O, he was a man already was little Tommy
Caffrey since he was out of pinnies.<eos>: 46.25471778868291
Edy told him no, no and to be off
now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.

—You’re not my sister, naughty Tommy said.<eos>: 50.48413321522049
It’s my ball.

But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her
finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand
and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.

—Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.

And she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played
here’s the lord mayor, here’s his two horses, here’s his gingerbread
carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper
chin.<eos>: 85.88071890977763
But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way
like that from everyone always petting him.

—I’d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won’t
say.

—On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.

Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy
saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her
life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was
sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said.<eos>: 71.21798415337832
But not a pin cared
Ciss.

—Let him!<eos>: 47.95275095205977
she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of
her nose.<eos>: 30.24190754567861
Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I’d look at
him.

Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls.<eos>: 34.54040198404088
You had to laugh at her sometimes.
For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea
and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on
her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to
go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the
Miss White.<eos>: 89.39576823352526
That was just like Cissycums.<eos>: 14.354111404519221
O, and will you ever forget
her the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the
burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a
cigarette.<eos>: 85.19538523942128
There was none to come up to her for fun.<eos>: 29.09597897634343
But she was
sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever
made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.

And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the
pealing anthem of the organ.<eos>: 53.999444914465
It was the men’s temperance retreat
conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S.<eos>: 26.701515855020023
J., rosary,
sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament.<eos>: 33.439870602600806
They were there
gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most
edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves,
after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the
immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her
to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin
of virgins.<eos>: 72.86824270811896
How sad to poor Gerty’s ears!<eos>: 75.99660492867302
Had her father only avoided
the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders
the drink habit cured in Pearson’s Weekly, she might now be rolling in
her carriage, second to none.<eos>: 105.61319061817746
Over and over had she told herself that
as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp
because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window
dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking.
But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had
cast its shadow over her childhood days.<eos>: 128.6852123699363
Nay, she had even witnessed in
the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen
her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself
completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it
was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of
kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.

And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,
Virgin most merciful.<eos>: 86.5047284909154
And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard
her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman
off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like
himself passing along the strand taking a short walk.<eos>: 152.0915289633043
You never saw him
any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a
father because he was too old or something or on account of his face
(it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the
pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose.<eos>: 79.73937641023372
Poor
father!<eos>: 10.920029964902167
With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me,
Mary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they
had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby’s salad dressing for supper
and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died
suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke.<eos>: 112.81500935896841
Her
mother’s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom
and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have
had a group taken.<eos>: 98.35877958894302
No-one would have thought the end was so near.<eos>: 74.84646865575992
Now
he was laid to rest.<eos>: 26.161614823784134
And her mother said to him to let that be a
warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the
funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him
the letters and samples from his office about Catesby’s cork lino,
artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and
always bright and cheery in the home.

A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the
house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in
gold.<eos>: 78.62698201853273
And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was
it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn’t
like her mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single
thing they ever had words about, taking snuff.<eos>: 75.25480825537747
Everyone thought the
world of her for her gentle ways.<eos>: 56.21374468245181
It was Gerty who turned off the gas
at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of
that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime
Mr Tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days
where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a
threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with
oldtime chivalry through her lattice window.<eos>: 62.80308151560334
You could see there was a
story behind it.<eos>: 31.32410449270157
The colours were done something lovely.<eos>: 134.38903438118953
She was in a
soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in
chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat.<eos>: 57.65180404613066
She often looked at them
dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own
arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and
thought about those times because she had found out in Walker’s
pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the
halcyon days what they meant.

The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till
at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no
getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he
could down towards the seaweedy rocks.<eos>: 112.44375385268326
Needless to say poor Tommy was
not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was
sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted
the ball.<eos>: 77.79571332055015
Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries
and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it
to her please.<eos>: 58.137257879150674
The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then
threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the
slope and stopped right under Gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the
rock.<eos>: 89.9446469820857
The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it
away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she
wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a
kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.

—If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.

Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip.<eos>: 105.65102462096579
A delicate pink crept into her
pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted
her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball
a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it
down towards the shingle.<eos>: 124.96539518004704
Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else
to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking.<eos>: 74.99946598199345
She
felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell,
surging and flaming into her cheeks.<eos>: 94.32963578140931
Till then they had only exchanged
glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she
ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the
twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had
ever seen.

Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted
and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain
of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray
for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose.<eos>: 72.65934668378918
And
careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many
who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all
that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told
them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary,
the most pious Virgin’s intercessory power that it was not recorded in
any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever
abandoned by her.

The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of
childhood are but as fleeting summer showers.<eos>: 144.26994453758863
Cissy Caffrey played with
baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air.
Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was
Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah!<eos>: 121.92979677833604
and, my
word, didn’t the little chap enjoy that!<eos>: 42.84438738533603
And then she told him to say
papa.

—Say papa, baby.<eos>: 53.473814105833256
Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.

And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for
eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of
health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out
to be something great, they said.

—Haja ja ja haja.

Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to
sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried
out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half
blanket the other way under him.<eos>: 99.09767384457814
Of course his infant majesty was most
obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:

—Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.

And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks.<eos>: 107.0257008248049
It was all
no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the
geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave
him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen
was quickly appeased.

Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out
of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little
brats of twins.<eos>: 52.064993007876424
She gazed out towards the distant sea.<eos>: 31.098277714401814
It was like the
paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured
chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out,
the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and
to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they
burned in the church like a kind of waft.<eos>: 52.04886104215892
And while she gazed her heart
went pitapat.<eos>: 78.82699739021729
Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning
in his look.<eos>: 50.442584352810854
His eyes burned into her as though they would search her
through and through, read her very soul.<eos>: 193.76480306171032
Wonderful eyes they were,
superbly expressive, but could you trust them?<eos>: 76.86231554458566
People were so queer.
She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face
that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin
Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred
because she wasn’t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they
two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see
whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he
was sitting.<eos>: 73.0950244541689
He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story
of a haunting sorrow was written on his face.<eos>: 43.80769865484912
She would have given
worlds to know what it was.<eos>: 25.57634056900472
He was looking up so intently, so still,
and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel
buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the
toes down.<eos>: 88.0004976302685
She was glad that something told her to put on the
transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was
far away.<eos>: 92.31296812304926
Here was that of which she had so often dreamed.<eos>: 47.76107689929625
It was he
who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him
because she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else.<eos>: 48.536479384202806
The very
heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she
knew on the instant it was him.<eos>: 33.47417704979434
If he had suffered, more sinned against
than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked
man, she cared not.<eos>: 79.36299668119185
Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could
convert him easily if he truly loved her.<eos>: 58.46716997750493
There were wounds that wanted
healing with heartbalm.<eos>: 26.851848867158118
She was a womanly woman not like other flighty
girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they
hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she
could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the
past.<eos>: 83.36813482038633
Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man,
crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for
herself alone.

Refuge of sinners.<eos>: 57.67530886421566
Comfortress of the afflicted.<eos>: 4.174374950903571
_Ora pro nobis_.<eos>: 11.588682689956075
Well
has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy
can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge
for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her
own heart.<eos>: 131.90503258261032
Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the
stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue
banners of the blessed Virgin’s sodality and Father Conroy was helping
Canon O’Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes
cast down.<eos>: 85.3325871929387
He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet
and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever
she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come
to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic.<eos>: 120.35746438504604
He told her that time
when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots
of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was
only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws, he
said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the
nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady
herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to
Thy Word.<eos>: 70.74654683460139
He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and
thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design
for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the
mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little
house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the
forty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a
present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or
some place.

The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky
threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it.<eos>: 90.22016193800053
Little
monkeys common as ditchwater.<eos>: 23.615533050216087
Someone ought to take them and give them
a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of
them.<eos>: 61.9106548046696
And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they
were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.

—Jacky!<eos>: 84.89647933030868
Tommy!

Not they!<eos>: 73.27656703694336
What a great notion they had!<eos>: 57.588164548916176
So Cissy said it was the very
last time she’d ever bring them out.<eos>: 50.38650084448923
She jumped up and called them and
she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had
a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the
thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow
long because it wasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat
at it.<eos>: 76.12344462731018
She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip
up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a
lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece
whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just
because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see
all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as
possible.<eos>: 60.99447915619764
It would have served her just right if she had tripped up
over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French
heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble.<eos>: 116.4347011769676
_Tableau!_
That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that
to witness.

Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints,
they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy
handed the thurible to Canon O’Hanlon and he put in the incense and
censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and
she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she
didn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a
bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking
that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O’Hanlon handed
the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the
Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she
just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to
the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_.<eos>: 71.36615093653135
Three and eleven she paid for those
stockings in Sparrow’s of George’s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday
before Easter and there wasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was
looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had
neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his
head to see the difference for himself.

Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with
her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a
streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought
only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her
petticoat hanging like a caricature.<eos>: 90.18122825679465
Gerty just took off her hat for a
moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown
tresses was never seen on a girl’s shoulders—a radiant little vision,
in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness.<eos>: 53.65352411344114
You would have to travel
many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that.<eos>: 94.81618438166676
She
could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes
that set her tingling in every nerve.<eos>: 93.93545658142747
She put on her hat so that she
could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster
for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes.<eos>: 63.6349051435563
He was
eying her as a snake eyes its prey.<eos>: 38.0100161693444
Her woman’s instinct told her that
she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet
swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a
glorious rose.

Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty,
half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the
baby.<eos>: 108.40588504603994
Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was
why no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no
concern of hers.<eos>: 72.2662772324946
And she said to Gerty:

—A penny for your thoughts.

—What?<eos>: 33.67724430667046
replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth.<eos>: 28.9706399963713
I
was only wondering was it late.

Because she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and
their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just
gave a gentle hint about its being late.<eos>: 66.87256258609959
And when Cissy came up Edy
asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was
half past kissing time, time to kiss again.<eos>: 146.83443367393858
But Edy wanted to know
because they were told to be in early.

—Wait, said Cissy, I’ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what’s the
time by his conundrum.

So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his
hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his
watchchain, looking up at the church.<eos>: 69.86587434534572
Passionate nature though he was
Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself.<eos>: 42.1876621089334
One moment
he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and
the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol
expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.

Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the
right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to
it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry
his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the
sun was set.<eos>: 88.96970095004637
His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in
measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.
Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said
his waterworks were out of order.

Then they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O’Hanlon
got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he
told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire
to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and
she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the
works and she swung her leg more in and out in time.<eos>: 67.7036507786598
It was getting
darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was
winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it
back and put his hands back into his pockets.<eos>: 52.90194981707704
She felt a kind of a
sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp
and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on
because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of
the moon.<eos>: 51.27543005579414
His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her
every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine.<eos>: 92.14409268731286
If ever there was
undisguised admiration in a man’s passionate gaze it was there plain to
be seen on that man’s face.<eos>: 59.70654363429027
It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you
know it.

Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty
noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect
because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place
to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied
their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O’Hanlon
stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed
him the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti
eis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and
asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just
answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she
heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over.<eos>: 71.79115303634478
Gerty winced sharply.
A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn
immeasurable.<eos>: 105.56186762441965
It hurt—O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet
way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded
little cat she was.<eos>: 225.9881660968586
Gerty’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but
she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless,
so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of.
She had loved him better than he knew.<eos>: 129.39653985081267
Lighthearted deceiver and fickle
like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and
for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears.
Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she
sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them
to see.

—O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head
flashed up.<eos>: 72.65799332464849
I can throw my cap at who I like because it’s leap year.

Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the
ringdove, but they cut the silence icily.<eos>: 83.54892195110519
There was that in her young
voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with.<eos>: 58.147210043883014
As
for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck
him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as
much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a
dozen pieces.<eos>: 99.7473401644209
And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him
one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot.
Miss puny little Edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty
could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a
towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft
had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was
something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and
never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it
so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.

Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked
in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because
the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior.<eos>: 89.8477127238341
And Cissy told
him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and
baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and
Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby,
without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and
sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.

—O my!<eos>: 86.7853850269208
Puddeny pie!<eos>: 29.731016099818596
protested Ciss.<eos>: 19.25642543358804
He has his bib destroyed.

The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set
that little matter to rights.

Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy
asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was
flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed
it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction
because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet
seashore because Canon O’Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that
Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the
Blessed Sacrament in his hands.

How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse
of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time
a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither,
thither, with a tiny lost cry.<eos>: 74.05829121178054
And she could see far away the lights of
the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of
paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the
lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church
grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked
and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn
his freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss
Cummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales.<eos>: 78.15334432310357
For Gerty had her
dreams that no-one knew of.<eos>: 150.61873767280895
She loved to read poetry and when she got a
keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the
coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of
her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was
scrupulously neat and clean.<eos>: 99.71741778046982
It was there she kept her girlish treasure
trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose
scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to
change when her things came home from the wash and there were some
beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in
Hely’s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if
she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so
deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening
round the potherbs.<eos>: 90.1417568244753
_Art thou real, my ideal?_ it was called by Louis J
Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt
thou ever?_ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient
loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the
years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one
shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an
accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.
But it must end, she felt.<eos>: 117.8215864311679
If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there
would be no holding back for her.<eos>: 57.85701248994613
Love laughs at locksmiths.<eos>: 40.191140666816956
She would
make the great sacrifice.<eos>: 27.651230512709002
Her every effort would be to share his
thoughts.<eos>: 74.41714166138978
Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his
days with happiness.<eos>: 68.35762679772633
There was the allimportant question and she was
dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife
or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land
of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind.<eos>: 95.70451511845954
But
even if—what then?<eos>: 75.33624820882096
Would it make a very great difference?<eos>: 36.38783321936535
From
everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively
recoiled.<eos>: 28.95188840381587
She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the
accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and
coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour, degrading the sex and
being taken up to the police station.<eos>: 79.66137102851177
No, no: not that.<eos>: 30.24933840289879
They would be
just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other
in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess.<eos>: 50.12465301108015
Perhaps it was
an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall.<eos>: 73.57455016509431
She
thought she understood.<eos>: 19.52473554411837
She would try to understand him because men
were so different.<eos>: 78.15383368912028
The old love was waiting, waiting with little white
hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes.<eos>: 123.23079402951751
Heart of mine!<eos>: 20.116496181567374
She would
follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he
was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was
the master guide.<eos>: 70.06092856893815
Nothing else mattered.<eos>: 16.790245805257957
Come what might she would be
wild, untrammelled, free.

Canon O’Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and
genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then
he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and
Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked
wasn’t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:

—O, look, Cissy!

And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over
the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.

—It’s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.

And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,
helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy
holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running.

—Come on, Gerty, Cissy called.<eos>: 98.25726762697356
It’s the bazaar fireworks.

But Gerty was adamant.<eos>: 40.57502501506666
She had no intention of being at their beck and
call.<eos>: 50.086666251984624
If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she
could see from where she was.<eos>: 70.72478992939118
The eyes that were fastened upon her set
her pulses tingling.<eos>: 39.672081491555346
She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance,
and a light broke in upon her.<eos>: 77.87955038617542
Whitehot passion was in that face,
passion silent as the grave, and it had made her his.<eos>: 118.28315525312266
At last they were
left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he
could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of
inflexible honour to his fingertips.<eos>: 73.36253035543064
His hands and face were working
and a tremour went over her.<eos>: 73.00718005347092
She leaned back far to look up where the
fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall
back looking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she
revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply
soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his
heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of
men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead
secret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that
was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had
pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and
she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine
sometimes in the bed.<eos>: 91.64295248297425
But this was altogether different from a thing
like that because there was all the difference because she could almost
feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his
handsome lips.<eos>: 134.83982992747318
Besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do
the other thing before being married and there ought to be women
priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy
Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes
so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors’
photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on
the way it did.

And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned
back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent
and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was
and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something
queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark.<eos>: 89.6987667109982
And
she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in
the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went
higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up
after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused
with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see
her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the
skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven,
on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and
then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was
trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full
view high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or
wading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that
immodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the
wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so
immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking.<eos>: 90.11671384258517
She
would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms
to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a
young girl’s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry
that has rung through the ages.<eos>: 74.07905378782736
And then a rocket sprang and bang shot
blind blank and O!<eos>: 353.445700515682
then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh
of O!<eos>: 85.85161329003448
and everyone cried O!<eos>: 107.79989794653456
O!<eos>: 5.45621285287314
in raptures and it gushed out of it a
stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah!<eos>: 82.13382472459223
they were all
greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet,
soft!

Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent.<eos>: 149.00566840285418
Ah!<eos>: 4.727096607653369
She
glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of
piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl.
He was leaning back against the rock behind.<eos>: 70.0971104795054
Leopold Bloom (for it is
he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes.
What a brute he had been!<eos>: 150.94723546176488
At it again?<eos>: 21.661674522687978
A fair unsullied soul had called
to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered?<eos>: 92.6078153028306
An utter cad he
had been!<eos>: 24.02005474479852
He of all men!<eos>: 43.09335998028291
But there was an infinite store of mercy in
those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and
sinned and wandered.<eos>: 89.09838407433995
Should a girl tell?<eos>: 36.663347619476504
No, a thousand times no.<eos>: 55.06108999182913
That
was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there
was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly
through the evening to and fro and little bats don’t tell.

Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to
show what a great person she was: and then she cried:

—Gerty!<eos>: 95.77299958961935
Gerty!<eos>: 15.27285029926573
We’re going.<eos>: 6.15227720439727
Come on.<eos>: 7.061696993660674
We can see from farther up.

Gerty had an idea, one of love’s little ruses.<eos>: 66.28433266330426
She slipped a hand into
her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of
course without letting him and then slipped it back.<eos>: 77.16463687345586
Wonder if he’s too
far to.<eos>: 20.647394361442785
She rose.<eos>: 8.01168727010263
Was it goodbye?<eos>: 29.29963095802048
No.<eos>: 5.3673087592043816
She had to go but they would meet
again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her
dream of yester eve.<eos>: 76.68734195736681
She drew herself up to her full height.<eos>: 50.172509755409656
Their
souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her
heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet
flowerlike face.<eos>: 87.82290863379193
She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile,
a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.

Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy,
to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman.<eos>: 94.42734914622467
It was
darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and
slippy seaweed.<eos>: 57.535710681353294
She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic
of her but with care and very slowly because—because Gerty MacDowell
was...

Tight boots?<eos>: 262.27109334339366
No.<eos>: 5.3673087592043816
She’s lame!<eos>: 15.431570843118159
O!

Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away.<eos>: 32.241153434754224
Poor girl!<eos>: 13.202805899827476
That’s why she’s
left on the shelf and the others did a sprint.<eos>: 27.028132353199442
Thought something was
wrong by the cut of her jib.<eos>: 35.68159072299538
Jilted beauty.<eos>: 12.483824816114595
A defect is ten times worse
in a woman.<eos>: 25.349887724377492
But makes them polite.<eos>: 28.225740889716143
Glad I didn’t know it when she was
on show.<eos>: 18.632358984359975
Hot little devil all the same.<eos>: 29.034978141051486
I wouldn’t mind.<eos>: 7.941290899229773
Curiosity like
a nun or a negress or a girl with glasses.<eos>: 41.785019188312866
That squinty one is
delicate.<eos>: 24.689822894767214
Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish.<eos>: 33.91951902390935
I
have such a bad headache today.<eos>: 24.88935066553638
Where did I put the letter?<eos>: 20.16900265420571
Yes, all
right.<eos>: 11.904341912298145
All kinds of crazy longings.<eos>: 23.28780434022472
Licking pennies.<eos>: 14.205690088675208
Girl in Tranquilla
convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil.<eos>: 124.38182349103782
Virgins go mad in the
end I suppose.<eos>: 48.65432641639559
Sister?<eos>: 5.4599632269786325
How many women in Dublin have it today?<eos>: 99.52373478898078
Martha,
she.<eos>: 10.399014523601156
Something in the air.<eos>: 7.913895397312761
That’s the moon.<eos>: 8.976624125164271
But then why don’t all
women menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean?<eos>: 33.44093807951905
Depends
on the time they were born I suppose.<eos>: 27.583758706180664
Or all start scratch then get out
of step.<eos>: 100.15673976594006
Sometimes Molly and Milly together.<eos>: 71.20117584292153
Anyhow I got the best of
that.<eos>: 23.303763786393453
Damned glad I didn’t do it in the bath this morning over her
silly I will punish you letter.<eos>: 46.594767885757804
Made up for that tramdriver this
morning.<eos>: 19.66390184411586
That gouger M’Coy stopping me to say nothing.<eos>: 24.81520664897335
And his wife
engagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe.<eos>: 73.93156568766052
Thankful for
small mercies.<eos>: 19.858452566561905
Cheap too.<eos>: 8.765283287321443
Yours for the asking.<eos>: 31.858053288249106

To aid
gentleman in literary.<eos>: 72.69814860388284
Ought to attend to my appearance my age.<eos>: 51.918584024791926
Didn’t

to smell.<eos>: 97.82454336741587
Hair strong in rut.<eos>: 40.01804265962378
Ten bob I got for Molly’s combings when
we were on the rocks in Holles street.<eos>: 38.83202529162857
Why not?<eos>: 10.043740010191765
Suppose he gave her
money.<eos>: 14.636175979989478
Why not?<eos>: 10.043740010191765
All a prejudice.<eos>: 4.388618949062117
She’s worth ten, fifteen, more, a
pound.<eos>: 46.687673462827
What?<eos>: 3.8546952873351206
I think so.<eos>: 17.58119177346578
All that for nothing.<eos>: 16.321034879831256
Bold hand: Mrs Marion.
Did I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent

Weighs on his mind.<eos>: 9.253262774621268
Funny my watch stopped at half past four.
Dust.<eos>: 230.85675626172164
Shark liver oil they use to clean.<eos>: 153.5841080355697
Could do it myself.<eos>: 13.585434404897226
Save.<eos>: 4.533035478553983
Was
that just when he, she?

O, he did.<eos>: 45.810644037562085
Into her.<eos>: 5.957772315168567
She did.<eos>: 9.163465573623421
Done.

Ah!

Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt.<eos>: 66.95999368209527
O Lord, that
little limping devil.<eos>: 41.54839011492437
Begins to feel cold and clammy.<eos>: 28.36548673403032
Aftereffect not
pleasant.<eos>: 36.19111988657247
Still you have to get rid of it someway.<eos>: 24.843826499540704
They don’t care.
Complimented perhaps.<eos>: 10.740332342230644
Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night
prayers with the kiddies.<eos>: 46.90237280863066
Well, aren’t they?<eos>: 15.91021373926375
See her as she is spoil
all.<eos>: 43.42730949270156
Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music.
The name too.<eos>: 79.20549170903737

Maiden discovered
with pensive bosom.<eos>: 68.93769119777362
Little sweetheart come and kiss me.<eos>: 58.41689800781892
Still, I feel.
The strength it gives a man.<eos>: 49.70190551710563
That’s the secret of it.<eos>: 13.317942361779442
Good job I let
off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam’s.<eos>: 65.95782725354995
Cider that was.
Otherwise I couldn’t have.<eos>: 18.98821133905348
Makes you want to sing after.<eos>: 21.296064999334714
_Lacaus esant
taratara_.<eos>: 3.3831009326705948
Suppose I spoke to her.<eos>: 16.656368599748482
What about?<eos>: 13.934835335797704
Bad plan however if you
don’t know how to end the conversation.<eos>: 42.96304651273872
Ask them a question they ask
you another.<eos>: 59.657811603244134
Good idea if you’re stuck.<eos>: 28.823865969801837
Gain time.<eos>: 10.049098789924916
But then you’re in a
cart.<eos>: 16.537077915084204
Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she’s
on for it: good evening.<eos>: 55.06980083466634
O but the dark evening in the Appian way I
nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was.<eos>: 85.70114227362563
Whew!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
Girl in Meath
street that night.<eos>: 16.604715484771333
All the dirty things I made her say.<eos>: 52.34686677901761
All wrong of
course.<eos>: 24.281567689122237
My arks she called it.<eos>: 15.985459657283256
It’s so hard to find one who.<eos>: 45.07995514682856
Aho!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
If
you don’t answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they
harden.<eos>: 38.49493499894653
And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings.
Parrots.<eos>: 64.28343863938747
Press the button and the bird will squeak.<eos>: 76.19358866222885
Wish she hadn’t
called me sir.<eos>: 23.93524932655192
O, her mouth in the dark!<eos>: 26.963389620383474
And you a married man with a
single girl!<eos>: 58.77909720817947
That’s what they enjoy.<eos>: 17.743894798841318
Taking a man from another woman.
Or even hear of it.<eos>: 87.98086764197697
Different with me.<eos>: 22.02980600161293
Glad to get away from other
chap’s wife.<eos>: 27.09840136853572
Eating off his cold plate.<eos>: 46.85484795251813
Chap in the Burton today
spitting back gumchewed gristle.<eos>: 44.64406996070398
French letter still in my pocketbook.
Cause of half the trouble.<eos>: 83.08033632102143
But might happen sometime, I don’t think.
Come in, all is prepared.<eos>: 58.09838722809893
I dreamt.<eos>: 9.022916235880169
What?<eos>: 3.8546952873351206
Worst is beginning.<eos>: 26.246702431700566
How they
change the venue when it’s not what they like.<eos>: 33.56250493122012
Ask you do you like
mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who.<eos>: 49.28258322564409
Or ask you what
someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped.<eos>: 36.860415446851775
Yet if I
went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that.<eos>: 65.83357551434648
Because I did.
She too.<eos>: 27.03135819609653
Offend her.<eos>: 11.119019756903233
Then make it up.<eos>: 24.47194912179924
Pretend to want something
awfully, then cry off for her sake.<eos>: 116.14825291449638
Flatters them.<eos>: 6.741509688902077
She must have been
thinking of someone else all the time.<eos>: 24.138311260879053
What harm?<eos>: 19.926093104661415
Must since she came
to the use of reason, he, he and he.<eos>: 48.25582058329855
First kiss does the trick.<eos>: 49.879919848535806
The
propitious moment.<eos>: 9.67465982828148
Something inside them goes pop.<eos>: 93.89258828631891
Mushy like, tell by
their eye, on the sly.<eos>: 60.1386123903928
First thoughts are best.<eos>: 83.60869655102837
Remember that till
their dying day.<eos>: 74.46600623401119
Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the
Moorish wall beside the gardens.<eos>: 108.87535183169277
Fifteen she told me.<eos>: 19.39640792897286
But her breasts
were developed.<eos>: 85.6368441259632
Fell asleep then.<eos>: 41.50449976226863
After Glencree dinner that was when
we drove home.<eos>: 99.04918193833238
Featherbed mountain.<eos>: 14.6042662294038
Gnashing her teeth in sleep.<eos>: 30.93674310165443
Lord
mayor had his eye on her too.<eos>: 49.663984767657695
Val Dillon.<eos>: 19.260867825110275
Apoplectic.

There she is with them down there for the fireworks.<eos>: 49.17941201958345
My fireworks.<eos>: 16.58908430997489
Up
like a rocket, down like a stick.<eos>: 54.80397705758996
And the children, twins they must be,
waiting for something to happen.<eos>: 70.14077019616911
Want to be grownups.<eos>: 5.264892097865691
Dressing in
mother’s clothes.<eos>: 18.52499622471658
Time enough, understand all the ways of the world.
And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth.<eos>: 55.590936318802896
I knew she
could whistle.<eos>: 37.888051140962915
Mouth made for that.<eos>: 20.720671472862602
Like Molly.<eos>: 9.252594519220276
Why that highclass
whore in Jammet’s wore her veil only to her nose.<eos>: 76.80863899337533
Would you mind,
please, telling me the right time?<eos>: 31.89141677654734
I’ll tell you the right time up a
dark lane.<eos>: 30.2413276997518
Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for
fat lips.<eos>: 67.52746015590762
Caressing the little boy too.<eos>: 23.487715022105544
Onlookers see most of the game.
Of course they understand birds, animals, babies.<eos>: 142.10761732067502
In their line.

Didn’t look back when she was going down the strand.<eos>: 28.986928064673105
Wouldn’t give that
satisfaction.<eos>: 12.832132693045205
Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls.
Fine eyes she had, clear.<eos>: 98.54100672781212
It’s the white of the eye brings that out not
so much the pupil.<eos>: 68.62591634643252
Did she know what I?<eos>: 18.16650891440548
Course.<eos>: 2.320145138862712
Like a cat sitting
beyond a dog’s jump.<eos>: 60.754761536364946
Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high
school drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show.<eos>: 60.53603701811779
Call
that innocence?<eos>: 20.309186146479302
Poor idiot!<eos>: 16.35503524057258
His wife has her work cut out for her.
Never see them sit on a bench marked _Wet Paint_.<eos>: 68.07690895302883
Eyes all over them.
Look under the bed for what’s not there.<eos>: 41.768979575812786
Longing to get the fright of
their lives.<eos>: 30.35445130410697
Sharp as needles they are.<eos>: 72.80903289732694
When I said to Molly the man at
the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like,
twigged at once he had a false arm.<eos>: 76.77154029043781
Had, too.<eos>: 19.737257379781234
Where do they get that?
Typist going up Roger Greene’s stairs two at a time to show her
understandings.<eos>: 40.967328073757926
Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean.
Bred in the bone.<eos>: 61.132002599399165
Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the
mirror to save the ironing.<eos>: 32.27933028240046
Best place for an ad to catch a woman’s eye
on a mirror.<eos>: 41.49853777813441
And when I sent her for Molly’s Paisley shawl to
Prescott’s by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her
stocking!<eos>: 72.90720883436202
Clever little minx.<eos>: 8.53179507397594
I never told her.<eos>: 13.958656523131786
Neat way she carries
parcels too.<eos>: 74.54900839406473
Attract men, small thing like that.<eos>: 62.07742305271012
Holding up her hand,
shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red.<eos>: 68.95314819558263
Who did you
learn that from?<eos>: 33.05469982635819
Nobody.<eos>: 4.6585270246090715
Something the nurse taught me.<eos>: 32.2841986209939
O, don’t they
know!<eos>: 9.619087834766153
Three years old she was in front of Molly’s dressingtable, just
before we left Lombard street west.<eos>: 49.858017652652435
Me have a nice pace.<eos>: 46.794046617542016

Lord, I am wet.<eos>: 23.707483604950443
Devil you are.
Swell of her calf.<eos>: 54.41645157466009

Not like that frump today.<eos>: 84.52739999396849

Beef to the heel.

A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles.<eos>: 19.904010516181664
Zrads
and zrads, zrads, zrads.<eos>: 3.810782985792627
And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see
and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the
rocks.<eos>: 79.54535870321303
Will she?<eos>: 9.433717997435583
Watch!<eos>: 7.956941596167406
Watch!<eos>: 7.956941596167406
See!<eos>: 7.561057403773845
Looked round.<eos>: 11.995249780297165
She smelt an onion.
Darling, I saw, your.<eos>: 56.90520563534772
I saw all.

Lord!

Did me good all the same.<eos>: 74.66116771478316
Off colour after Kiernan’s, Dignam’s.<eos>: 41.445516051153206
For
this relief much thanks.<eos>: 39.120528943077645
In _Hamlet,_ that is.<eos>: 29.21127205008187
Lord!<eos>: 8.55539790233796
It was all things
combined.<eos>: 18.49595127410145
Excitement.<eos>: 6.957325798697316
When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of
my tongue.<eos>: 38.6625414634157
Your head it simply swirls.<eos>: 27.527913691335577
He’s right.<eos>: 6.139642564552233
Might have made a
worse fool of myself however.<eos>: 62.10135409839206
Instead of talking about nothing.<eos>: 27.18914523755306
Then I
will tell you all.<eos>: 20.009170569856032
Still it was a kind of language between us.<eos>: 28.011068246653412
It
couldn’t be?<eos>: 11.356245775005753
No, Gerty they called her.<eos>: 67.95865788820325
Might be false name however
like my name and the address Dolphin’s barn a blind.

     Her maiden name was Jemina Brown
     And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.

Place made me think of that I suppose.<eos>: 111.01407103466575
All tarred with the same brush.
Wiping pens in their stockings.<eos>: 35.65736945853812
But the ball rolled down to her as if
it understood.<eos>: 65.32086162735528
Every bullet has its billet.<eos>: 12.111757321192856

Sad however

Dignam.
Children’s hands always round them.<eos>: 55.2769868777022
Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even
closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds.
Oughtn’t to have given that child an empty teat to suck.<eos>: 82.07198470084023

Wonder is
nurse Callan there still.<eos>: 159.33267587886922
She used to look over some nights when Molly
was in the Coffee Palace.<eos>: 46.48338499690489
That young doctor O’Hare I noticed her
brushing his coat.<eos>: 89.82839546076075
And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too,
marriageable.<eos>: 59.727355998691785
Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City
Arms.<eos>: 52.867139109519776
Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat.
Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose.<eos>: 91.01589334247963
Then ask in
the morning: was I drunk last night?<eos>: 68.6627787901831
Bad policy however to fault the
husband.<eos>: 152.80686514575353
Chickens come home to roost.<eos>: 17.82505801145562
They stick by one another like
glue.<eos>: 53.4359098010727
Maybe the women’s fault also.<eos>: 29.436307203175968
That’s where Molly can knock spots
off them.<eos>: 52.41403893658908
It’s the blood of the south.<eos>: 13.951398815654153
Moorish.<eos>: 5.137902078631336
Also the form, the
figure.<eos>: 33.465277811874174
Hands felt for the opulent.<eos>: 31.679928166540876
Just compare for instance those
others.<eos>: 68.01113407729592
Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard.<eos>: 37.99619566334732
Allow me to
introduce my.<eos>: 26.71504864401093
Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript,
wouldn’t know what to call her.<eos>: 44.315279180900234
Always see a fellow’s weak point in his
wife.<eos>: 28.810807154157523
Still there’s destiny in it, falling in love.<eos>: 39.80525988944209
Have their own
secrets between them.<eos>: 68.36311527804025
Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman
didn’t take them in hand.<eos>: 46.882174466651165
Then little chits of girls, height of a
shilling in coppers, with little hubbies.<eos>: 43.291903642115685

This wet is very unpleasant.<eos>: 45.15494845655509
Stuck.<eos>: 2.788313347840835
Well the foreskin is
not back.<eos>: 22.768984062548036
Better detach.

Ow!

Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket.<eos>: 33.6445176512522
Long and the
short of it.<eos>: 38.31025522732063
Big he and little she.<eos>: 79.99243937272279
Very strange about my watch.
Wristwatches are always going wrong.<eos>: 56.58099443653039
Wonder is there any magnetic
influence between the person because that was about the time he.<eos>: 63.77909649825929
Yes, I
suppose, at once.<eos>: 20.91123541030251
Cat’s away, the mice will play.<eos>: 32.335252876650095
I remember looking in
Pill lane.<eos>: 20.707759568615046
Also that now is magnetism.<eos>: 13.372603626661839
Back of everything magnetism.
Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled.<eos>: 167.0819325764945
That causes movement.
And time, well that’s the time the movement takes.<eos>: 90.78987852353671
Then if one thing
stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit.<eos>: 193.99945045141203
Because it’s all
arranged.<eos>: 17.59601477894677
Magnetic needle tells you what’s going on in the sun, the
stars.<eos>: 39.743638462288814
Little piece of steel iron.<eos>: 43.66556012105346
When you hold out the fork.<eos>: 32.87872840242255
Come.
Come.<eos>: 8.146355180024086
Tip.<eos>: 1.6200743805514044
Woman and man that is.<eos>: 23.792069885689067
Fork and steel.<eos>: 37.21319343363063
Molly, he.<eos>: 10.546720239076063
Dress up
and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if
you’re a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look
and if you have any guts in you.<eos>: 64.93253924762928
Tip.<eos>: 1.6200743805514044
Have to let fly.

Wonder how is she feeling in that region.<eos>: 106.33160131722322
Shame all put on before third
person.<eos>: 123.99752892345181
More put out about a hole in her stocking.<eos>: 25.83364881766209
Molly, her underjaw
stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at
the horse show.<eos>: 47.80742790667625
And when the painters were in Lombard street west.<eos>: 15.05492672130084
Fine
voice that fellow had.<eos>: 31.455673976785558
How Giuglini began.<eos>: 30.868526071418838
Smell that I did.<eos>: 12.599650486127006
Like
flowers.<eos>: 11.812911882052795
It was too.<eos>: 8.82623939593257
Violets.<eos>: 3.1476326550834623
Came from the turpentine probably in the
paint.<eos>: 11.223301577134803
Make their own use of everything.<eos>: 38.26998003246612
Same time doing it scraped her
slipper on the floor so they wouldn’t hear.<eos>: 39.89906917621974
But lots of them can’t kick
the beam, I think.<eos>: 42.1454619416845
Keep that thing up for hours.<eos>: 48.49271203741939
Kind of a general all
round over me and half down my back.

Wait.<eos>: 84.92320086320373
Hm.<eos>: 1.4632443430456434
Hm.<eos>: 1.4632443430456434
Yes.<eos>: 2.0880743848448278
That’s her perfume.<eos>: 22.807720687635353
Why she waved her hand.<eos>: 28.602329707246895
I leave
you this to think of me when I’m far away on the pillow.<eos>: 36.54498601689006
What is it?
Heliotrope?<eos>: 8.111904152407345
No.<eos>: 5.3673087592043816
Hyacinth?<eos>: 5.454663312069258
Hm.<eos>: 1.4632443430456434
Roses, I think.<eos>: 6.648392431571261
She’d like scent of that
kind.<eos>: 27.83032002605534
Sweet and cheap: soon sour.<eos>: 188.4511892274018
Why Molly likes opoponax.<eos>: 24.648867292554858
Suits her,
with a little jessamine mixed.<eos>: 36.49930118038075
Her high notes and her low notes.<eos>: 81.71704981712767
At the
dance night she met him, dance of the hours.<eos>: 71.46377558124667
Heat brought it out.<eos>: 21.02684449968818
She
was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before.<eos>: 61.1343617821103
Good
conductor, is it?<eos>: 40.29146291243916
Or bad?<eos>: 25.02640539509979
Light too.<eos>: 8.969162842676205
Suppose there’s some connection.
For instance if you go into a cellar where it’s dark.<eos>: 33.29871887773549
Mysterious thing
too.<eos>: 16.56512553337154
Why did I smell it only now?<eos>: 49.24808615836116
Took its time in coming like herself,
slow but sure.<eos>: 217.91612273752125
Suppose it’s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown
across.<eos>: 56.03691690813193
Yes, it is.<eos>: 7.869554034236928
Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this
morning, smell them leagues off.<eos>: 69.89623302674524
Tell you what it is.<eos>: 10.858046610427728
It’s like a fine
fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you
call it gossamer, and they’re always spinning it out of them, fine as
anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it.<eos>: 73.27338117722654
Clings to everything
she takes off.<eos>: 73.55203124951711
Vamp of her stockings.<eos>: 15.872559066262662
Warm shoe.<eos>: 31.466769473950247
Stays.<eos>: 1.6985491192842848
Drawers: little
kick, taking them off.<eos>: 66.78724997451047
Byby till next time.<eos>: 39.92687067899969
Also the cat likes to sniff
in her shift on the bed.<eos>: 27.729997109357736
Know her smell in a thousand.<eos>: 42.06419469643037
Bathwater too.
Reminds me of strawberries and cream.<eos>: 53.024423563906375
Wonder where it is really.<eos>: 18.431192028762204
There
or the armpits or under the neck.<eos>: 64.56606055167222
Because you get it out of all holes
and corners.<eos>: 26.737354819662514
Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something.
Muskrat.<eos>: 80.06539603444045
Bag under their tails.<eos>: 23.941579172252702
One grain pour off odour for years.
Dogs at each other behind.<eos>: 177.67280007880186
Good evening.<eos>: 11.38686283583083
Evening.<eos>: 4.5372935095564175
How do you sniff?<eos>: 7.125871567252961
Hm.
Hm.<eos>: 9.686441823519782
Very well, thank you.<eos>: 16.428530252572234
Animals go by that.<eos>: 20.204676591932014
Yes now, look at it that
way.<eos>: 23.676542427133885
We’re the same.<eos>: 8.90756354128529
Some women, instance, warn you off when they have
their period.<eos>: 109.38135339935299
Come near.<eos>: 11.011401817945197
Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on.
Like what?<eos>: 76.67239152671493
Potted herrings gone stale or.<eos>: 241.0824263649072
Boof!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
Please keep off the
grass.

Perhaps they get a man smell off us.<eos>: 82.93512647190431
What though?<eos>: 12.283277597247615
Cigary gloves long
John had on his desk the other day.<eos>: 139.1839302338059
Breath?<eos>: 5.658978876481857
What you eat and drink
gives that.<eos>: 135.42425894970984
No.<eos>: 5.3673087592043816
Mansmell, I mean.<eos>: 8.31647600521847
Must be connected with that because
priests that are supposed to be are different.<eos>: 80.59415370262984
Women buzz round it like
flies round treacle.<eos>: 115.20992899743925
Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost.<eos>: 57.40821037448359
The
tree of forbidden priest.<eos>: 37.09860907173442
O, father, will you?<eos>: 12.545818395215086
Let me be the first to.
That diffuses itself all through the body, permeates.<eos>: 52.43821825964546
Source of life.
And it’s extremely curious the smell.<eos>: 38.99582744563817
Celery sauce.<eos>: 16.923467322908397
Let me.

Mr Bloom inserted his nose.<eos>: 16.181701137436963
Hm.<eos>: 1.4632443430456434
Into the.<eos>: 7.392318144149985
Hm.<eos>: 1.4632443430456434
Opening of his waistcoat.
Almonds or.<eos>: 22.036199813722504
No.<eos>: 5.3673087592043816
Lemons it is.<eos>: 10.402855200798504
Ah no, that’s the soap.

O by the by that lotion.<eos>: 51.78525248739369
I knew there was something on my mind.<eos>: 24.11268306569627
Never
went back and the soap not paid.<eos>: 51.69789281250244
Dislike carrying bottles like that hag
this morning.<eos>: 97.384937290787
Hynes might have paid me that three shillings.<eos>: 46.18102406841514
I could
mention Meagher’s just to remind him.<eos>: 31.422364309439484
Still if he works that paragraph.
Two and nine.<eos>: 107.51142974313134
Bad opinion of me he’ll have.<eos>: 32.6361629383071
Call tomorrow.<eos>: 9.11960353011715
How much do
I owe you?<eos>: 29.307085516171334
Three and nine?<eos>: 60.88001922246395
Two and nine, sir.<eos>: 33.65040644076901
Ah.<eos>: 2.16889625590272
Might stop him giving
credit another time.<eos>: 78.95919819530864
Lose your customers that way.<eos>: 14.580892736727712
Pubs do.<eos>: 16.268768302897755
Fellows run
up a bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets into
somewhere else.

Here’s this nobleman passed before.<eos>: 126.60412603099954
Blown in from the bay.<eos>: 19.25841036229346
Just went as
far as turn back.<eos>: 46.75547141897667

Looks mangled out: had

Enjoying nature now.<eos>: 31.796272313166433
Grace after meals.<eos>: 24.293648073976996
After supper
walk a mile.<eos>: 114.53047122957038
Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government
sit.<eos>: 122.92556923633549
Walk after him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today.
Still you learn something.<eos>: 100.52125830679714
See ourselves as others see us.<eos>: 60.635260351811354
So long as
women don’t mock what matter?<eos>: 51.78370507420188
That’s the way to find out.<eos>: 17.18784457276337
Ask yourself
who is he now.<eos>: 27.272640861510887

Now
if you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn’t.<eos>: 32.7580420693942
Chance.
We’ll never meet again.<eos>: 31.713074937791884

Just
for a few

     Cuckoo
     Cuckoo
     Cuckoo.

The clock on the mantelpiece in the priest’s house cooed where Canon
O’Hanlon and Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.<eos>: 54.96422041718253

were
taking tea and sodabread and butter and fried mutton chops with catsup
and talking about

     Cuckoo

     Cuckoo.

Because it was a little canarybird that came out of its little house to
tell the time that Gerty MacDowell noticed the time she was there
because she was as quick as anything about a thing like that, was Gerty
MacDowell, and she noticed at once that that foreign gentleman that was
sitting on the rocks looking was

     Cuckoo

Universally that person’s acumen is esteemed very little perceptive
concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by
mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that
which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in
them high mind’s ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain
when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being
equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more
efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have
progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent
continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when
fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent
nature’s incorrupted benefaction.<eos>: 74.9104044506978
For who is there who anything of some
significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior
splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or
on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive
that as no nature’s boon can contend against the bounty of increase so
it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and
admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past
been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not
with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have
gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to
that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who
would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence
can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel
simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy
of abundance or with diminution’s menace that exalted of reiteratedly
procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?

It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians
relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature
admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured.
Not to speak of hostels, leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves,
their greatest doctors, the O’Shiels, the O’Hickeys, the O’Lees, have
sedulously set down the divers methods by which the sick and the
relapsed found again health whether the malady had been the trembling
withering or loose boyconnell flux.<eos>: 71.8420412160923
Certainly in every public work
which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with
importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted
(whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it
is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent
inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest)
whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that
whatever care the patient in that allhardest of woman hour chiefly
required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who
not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely
could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was
provided.

To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be
molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent
mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received
eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the
case was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying
desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be
received into that domicile.<eos>: 126.43914987379735
O thing of prudent nation not merely in
being seen but also even in being related worthy of being praised that
they her by anticipation went seeing mother, that she by them suddenly
to be about to be cherished had been begun she felt!

A couch by midwives attended

forthbringing were now done and by wise foresight set: but to this no

and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his
undeathliness.<eos>: 112.83599750659903
He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring.<eos>: 272.29708272089704
So
stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other.

Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the
dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came
naked forth from his mother’s womb so naked shall he wend him at the
last for to go as he came.

The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman
and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in
childbed.<eos>: 105.14761232764297
The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in
throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to
bear but that now in a little it would be.<eos>: 78.57382119987567
She said thereto that she
had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that
woman’s birth.<eos>: 83.63974036546473
Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew
the man that time was had lived nigh that house.<eos>: 114.87876002042584
The man hearkened to
her words for he felt with wonder women’s woe in the travail that they
have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair
face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a
handmaid.<eos>: 66.1976655611196
Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.

And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there
nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat.<eos>: 76.32793581620965
And there
came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept
Dixon.<eos>: 75.74089365070074
And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed
that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where
this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be
healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a
horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a
salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice.<eos>: 51.14321724386492
And he
said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with
them that were there.<eos>: 73.19864426205564
And the traveller Leopold said that he should go
otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile.<eos>: 26.849665066105636
Also the lady
was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well
that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility.<eos>: 52.26379590561221
But
the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have
him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a
marvellous castle.<eos>: 105.13288725099609
And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for
to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches
environing in divers lands and sometime venery.

And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy
and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not
move more for enchantment.<eos>: 90.10939674941913
And on this board were frightful swords and
knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white
flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there
abound marvellously.<eos>: 41.413689068160146
And there were vessels that are wrought by magic
of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that
he blases in to them like to bubbles.<eos>: 48.45446872168116
And full fair cheer and rich was
on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer.<eos>: 100.56763524520758
And there
was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay
strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be
possible thing without they see it natheless they are so.<eos>: 126.00488102208712
And these
fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of
the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress.<eos>: 59.68906770805549
And
also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a
compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of
certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like
to a vast mountain.<eos>: 88.3860489058601
And they teach the serpents there to entwine
themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of
these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.

And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp
thereto the while all they that were there drank every each.<eos>: 121.41356910130824
And childe
Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat
in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and
anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and
his neighbour nist not of this wile.<eos>: 138.6222714756903
And he sat down in that castle
with them for to rest him there awhile.<eos>: 77.15162852387802
Thanked be Almighty God.

This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at
the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing
for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time
hied fast.<eos>: 153.23694448297263
Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered
what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he,
that it be not come or now.<eos>: 119.97839133297023
Meseems it dureth overlong.<eos>: 9.14937083003502
And he was ware
and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was
older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights
virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke
to him full gently.<eos>: 82.14465824635981
But, said he, or it be long too she will bring
forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath
waited marvellous long.<eos>: 131.34488276040403
And the franklin that had drunken said,
Expecting each moment to be her next.<eos>: 97.04328979827915
Also he took the cup that stood
tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to
drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far
as he might to their both’s health for he was a passing good man of his
lustiness.<eos>: 104.07582462073155
And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat
in scholars’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that
ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight
of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged
him courtly in the cup.<eos>: 75.28189260703152
Woman’s woe with wonder pondering.

Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be
drunken an they might.<eos>: 62.653133191723505
There was a sort of scholars along either side
the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary
Merciable’s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of
medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa,
one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at
head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long
of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young
Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and
beside the meek sir Leopold.<eos>: 134.0913341982314
But on young Malachi they waited for that
he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how
he had broke his avow.<eos>: 179.62644005646186
And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast
friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that
his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as
they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner.<eos>: 129.87434208379943
Ruth red
him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.

For they were right witty scholars.<eos>: 163.7656292650931
And he heard their aresouns each
gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining
that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen
out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne’s house
that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next
before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her
case).<eos>: 120.79833068327137
And they said farther she should live because in the beginning,
they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that
were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for
he had conscience to let her die.<eos>: 182.16204403815436
And not few and of these was young
Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it
was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the
law nor his judges did provide no remedy.<eos>: 253.9378862092844
A redress God grant.<eos>: 28.068094643434428
This was
scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother,
the wife should live and the babe to die.<eos>: 121.33909028233943
In colour whereof they waxed
hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but
the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at
the least way mirth might not lack.<eos>: 217.9141989395209
Then young Madden showed all the
whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion
sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint
Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby
they were all wondrous grieved.<eos>: 94.49011967444883
To whom young Stephen had these words
following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk.<eos>: 158.6788807633456
Both babe and
parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in
purgefire.<eos>: 36.78842260904268
But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we
nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very
God, Lord and Giver of Life?<eos>: 59.1287614097864
For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief.<eos>: 36.35932723838245
We
are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends
than we.<eos>: 291.4172927093597
Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends.
But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was
that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or
leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead.
Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi’s praise of that
beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the
other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they
did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his
engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to
do.<eos>: 85.81373012069567
Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir
Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour
which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare
whoso she might be or wheresoever.<eos>: 144.16084174341208
Then spake young Stephen orgulous of
mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons,
of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of
brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius
saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or
an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu
secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of
Averroes and Moses Maimonides.<eos>: 62.01181470257804
He said also how at the end of the
second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother
foldeth ever souls for God’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother
which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he
that holdeth the fisherman’s seal, even that blessed Peter on which
rock was holy church for all ages founded.<eos>: 179.27072532103003
All they bachelors then
asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as
risk life to save life.<eos>: 302.31672307614843
A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted
all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that
as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a
layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an
accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had
birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their
questions.<eos>: 118.60504108738111
That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant
word.<eos>: 34.29861962574781
Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he
averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he
was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that
taking it appeared eftsoons.

But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had
pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and
as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only
manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art
could save so dark is destiny.<eos>: 142.3271725307411
And she was wondrous stricken of heart
for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of
lamb’s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and
lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir
Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him
his friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness
and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for
all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure
for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and
murdered his goods with whores.

About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty
so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed
their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying
for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge
the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray.<eos>: 111.46380313547328
Now drink
we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed
parcel of my body but my soul’s bodiment.<eos>: 70.5353198645635
Leave ye fraction of bread to
them that live by bread alone.<eos>: 102.58196820227863
Be not afeard neither for any want for
this will comfort more than the other will dismay.<eos>: 101.5746091080003
See ye here.<eos>: 34.11242065524064
And he
showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the
worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song
which he writ.<eos>: 93.47773323999932
They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such
dearth of money as was herebefore.<eos>: 35.96903859136832
His words were then these as
followeth: Know all men, he said, time’s ruins build eternity’s
mansions.<eos>: 67.35668444055145
What means this?<eos>: 34.101764791016
Desire’s wind blasts the thorntree but after

No question but
her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer,
Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and
Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae
supplicem_, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is
the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other,
our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of
navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin.
But here is the matter now.<eos>: 55.37412397328108
Or she knew him, that second I say, and was
but creature of her creature, _vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio_, or
she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy

Joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages,

Entweder_

subsubstantiality.<eos>: 32.9322832407746
And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word.<eos>: 57.6456695029658
A
pregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without
blemish, a belly without bigness.<eos>: 39.643926953017754

With will will we withstand, withsay.

Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would
sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod
of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack:
_The first three months she was not well, Staboo,_ when here nurse
Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was
it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all
orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no
gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard.<eos>: 107.57683155704802
It was an
ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in
habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her
hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of
them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness
some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all
chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at,
thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou
chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou,
to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the
good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet,
margerain gentle, advising also the time’s occasion as most sacred and
most worthy to be most sacred.<eos>: 97.61787366557023
In Horne’s house rest should reign.

To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in
Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he
had not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the
womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days.<eos>: 100.16226538369705
Master
Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds
and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue
of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all
intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership.<eos>: 62.27037321855305
But he
said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was
the eternal son and ever virgin.<eos>: 132.44842950486407
Thereat mirth grew in them the more
and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing
and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island,
she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain,
with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries
and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was
there unmaided.<eos>: 38.53816293039731
He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those
delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is
in their _Maid’s Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers:
_To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable
concent upon the virginals.<eos>: 65.52467412576539
An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most
mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous
flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium

Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed,
but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher
for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come.<eos>: 103.5343812042787
Young Stephen
said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between
them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for
life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved
with it.<eos>: 82.46164577587658
Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay
down his wife for his friend.<eos>: 63.995595736877625

Remember, Erin, thy
generations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by

in my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum.<eos>: 130.84588665855355

But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon
and my sun thou hast quenched for ever.<eos>: 190.58379047451433
And thou hast left me alone for
ever in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast
thou kissed my mouth.<eos>: 170.2622039294071

And as the ends
and ultimates of all things accord in some mean and measure with their
inceptions and originals, that same multiplicit concordance which leads
forth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis

And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor

his whenceness.

Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _Etienne chanson_ but he
loudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast
majestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all
in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea.

     Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack
     See the malt stored in many a refluent sack,
     In the proud cirque of Jackjohn’s bivouac.

A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back.<eos>: 74.46826790702514

And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as
they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before
so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart
shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that
storm.<eos>: 63.31201810984369
Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard
again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he
was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour.<eos>: 137.92773658638234
But the
braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was
muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead.<eos>: 46.880204856943315
But this was
only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne’s hall.<eos>: 34.83238210275548
He
drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it
thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden,
being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of
doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart’s side, spoke to him calming
words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing
but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the
thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a
natural phenomenon.

But was young Boasthard’s fear vanquished by Calmer’s words?<eos>: 85.67670790314637
No, for he
had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be
done away.<eos>: 108.6830816819889
And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the
other?<eos>: 86.5901769671555
He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either.<eos>: 37.46543267827894
But
could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the
bottle Holiness that then he lived withal?<eos>: 87.72012888078125
Indeed no for Grace was not
there to find that bottle.<eos>: 98.76496335245466
Heard he then in that clap the voice of the
god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon?<eos>: 61.60547859049993
Heard?
Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube
Understanding (which he had not done).<eos>: 99.06972843712862
For through that tube he saw
that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one
day die as he was like the rest too a passing show.<eos>: 84.38080568307065
And would he not
accept to die like the rest and pass away?<eos>: 92.1306487236012
By no means would he though
he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives
which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law.<eos>: 303.1626513647862
Then wotted
he nought of that other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the
land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for
ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering
at which all shall come as many as believe on it?<eos>: 140.21087142089388
Yes, Pious had told
him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason
was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing
exterior whose name, she said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him
wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as,
Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave
place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot
which is named Two-in-the-Bush or, by some learned, Carnal
Concupiscence.

This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of
Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore
Bird-in-the-Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a
wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and
know her.<eos>: 103.61960594979868
For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else but
notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first,
Two-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and
in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words
printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by
Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they
cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of
oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring
that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was
named Killchild.<eos>: 101.79833563178056
So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr
Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon,
Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer.<eos>: 90.70317122866258
Wherein, O wretched company,
were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a
very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill
their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them
contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.

So Thursday sixteenth June Patk.<eos>: 84.0096249007156
Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and
after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a
fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won’t sprout, fields
athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.
Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without
sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without.<eos>: 102.4755035114681
The
rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought
but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire.<eos>: 165.79265142707072
All the world
saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that
did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness.
But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in
the west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and
the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first
and after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder
and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the
smoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or
kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the
pour came.<eos>: 102.73375071099568
In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke’s lawn, thence through
Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was

he bound home and he to Andrew Horne’s being stayed for to crush a cup
of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of
her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and
so both together on to Horne’s.<eos>: 132.60283857806644

Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having
dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers
on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be
for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading
her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term,
the midwives sore put to it and can’t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of
riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very
heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they
say, but God give her soon issue.<eos>: 113.3132257640659
’Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear,
and Lady day bit off her last chick’s nails that was then a twelvemonth
and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand
in the king’s bible.<eos>: 86.4282524918565
Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the
sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys
off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in
a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag,
I hear.<eos>: 69.40844213888482
In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and
will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and
water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi’s almanac (and I
hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out
of the Hindustanish for his farmer’s gazette) to have three things in
all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and
bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their
queerities no telling how.

With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the
letter was in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about
him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but
on Stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit
near by which he did mighty brisk.<eos>: 94.62666982556559
He was a kind of sport gentleman
that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of
women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat.<eos>: 70.98949847640512
To tell the truth he
was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the
coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul’s men,
runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues
of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at
nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much
loose gossip.<eos>: 42.42530563075681
He took his ordinary at a boilingcook’s and if he had but
gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a
bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his
tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every
mother’s son of them would burst their sides.<eos>: 47.41192258699845
The other, Costello that
is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale.<eos>: 191.7992683992494
Faith, no, he
says, Frank (that was his name), ’tis all about Kerry cows that are to
be butchered along of the plague.<eos>: 78.27144298779932
But they can go hang, says he with a
wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it.<eos>: 51.43462503454159
There’s as good fish
in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take
of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the
meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his
embassy as he was sharpset.<eos>: 73.03016056509392
_Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the
French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a
winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too.<eos>: 44.43640002778217
From a
child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough,
who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of
the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but
he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar
with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes.<eos>: 58.4216208080894
One
time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought
would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for
the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk,
kidnapping a squire’s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids’
linen or choking chicken behind a hedge.<eos>: 61.21679075902673
He had been off as many times
as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to
his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw
him.<eos>: 125.18532823751002
What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to
know the drift of it, will they slaughter all?<eos>: 67.7519667841144
I protest I saw them but
this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he.<eos>: 114.23831756347597
I can scarce
believe ’tis so bad, says he.<eos>: 39.16088692717127
And he had experience of the like brood
beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been
some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster
that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr
Gavin Low’s yard in Prussia street.<eos>: 86.66790413138048
I question with you there, says he.
More like ’tis the hoose or the timber tongue.<eos>: 60.033768705624176
Mr Stephen, a little
moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had
dispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler thanking him for the
hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted
cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the
bull by the horns.<eos>: 54.21133459113817
Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing.<eos>: 22.189896910277373
He’ll
find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that’s
Irish, says he.<eos>: 23.05919603975066
Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and
he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop.<eos>: 102.8921544949648
I
conceive you, says Mr Dixon.<eos>: 16.288216575624475
It is that same bull that was sent to our
island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with
an emerald ring in his nose.<eos>: 83.0062905458411
True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the
table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a
portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock.<eos>: 32.82202233298478
He had horns galore, a
coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his
nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and
rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.
What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas
that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who
were no better off than himself.<eos>: 92.6060337733214
So be off now, says he, and do all my
cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing,
and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly.<eos>: 79.39352598020244
But the slap and
the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he
taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess
and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the
month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the
nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young
ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland.<eos>: 110.66745571607812
Another then put in his
word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat
with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his
forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables
for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of
the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his
heart’s content.<eos>: 52.84736832839376
By this time the father of the faithful (for so they
called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture.<eos>: 103.04778750907737
To
remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in
their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on
his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow
out of him in bulls’ language and they all after him.<eos>: 75.5728808710909
Ay, says another,
and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the
land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his
mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the
island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the
grass that grows on the ground.<eos>: 89.23600900173355
And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got
scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a
husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or
a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half the countryside rooting
up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry’s orders.
There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the
lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an
old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I’ll meddle in
his matters, says he.<eos>: 53.096605531529924
I’ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with
the help of that good pizzle my father left me.<eos>: 69.3081476146797
But one evening, says
Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to
dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the
first rule of the course was that the others were to row with
pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and
on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he
found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous
champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for
boss of the show.<eos>: 60.2640671780682
After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his
head into a cow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers
and pulling it out again told them all his new name.<eos>: 36.75029662891583
Then, with the
water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had
belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language
to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first
personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if
ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write
it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or
a bale of cotton or a corkfloat.<eos>: 73.78818606054115
In short, he and the bull of Ireland
were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt.<eos>: 130.7469295315289
They were, says Mr
Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was
toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft,
loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all
masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread
three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed
anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times
three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea
to recover the main of America.<eos>: 73.47640371683237
Which was the occasion, says Mr
Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty:

_—Pope Peter’s but a pissabed.

A man’s a man for a’ that._

Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway
as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend
whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon,
who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a
cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars.<eos>: 62.504020606278466
Mr Mulligan was civil
enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a
project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched
on.<eos>: 109.84890773945118
Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards
which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell’s bearing a legend
printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan.<eos>: 100.39054921677793
Fertiliser and
Incubator.<eos>: 3.9376064701459472
Lambay Island_.<eos>: 2.842387380473868
His project, as he went on to expound, was
to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief
business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and
to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has
been framed.<eos>: 65.72856166401252
Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon.<eos>: 42.15860002173381
I
make no doubt it smacks of wenching.<eos>: 24.75107997605494
Come, be seated, both.<eos>: 43.96879978512022
’Tis as
cheap sitting as standing.<eos>: 158.36780595464927
Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and,
expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into
this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the
inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were
due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as
whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from
proclivities acquired.<eos>: 43.744131802536074
It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the
nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so
many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest
bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial
cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some
unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness,
sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty
fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart
weep.<eos>: 67.56966641110726
To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a
suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of
worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in
fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord
Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our
ascendancy party.<eos>: 85.00098434055647
He proposed to set up there a national fertilising
farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the
fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the
fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there
direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her
natural.<eos>: 68.82956461805068
Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for
his pains.<eos>: 44.71209650762693
The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of
fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm
persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man.<eos>: 73.77604278810122
For his
nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet
of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these
latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both
broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum
chillies.<eos>: 38.68342680848281
After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of
asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief
with which he had shielded it.<eos>: 67.16660934270526
They both, it seems, had been overtaken
by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as
might be observed by Mr Mulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which
was now somewhat piebald.<eos>: 61.82376404542967
His project meanwhile was very favourably
entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr
Dixon of Mary’s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he
purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle.<eos>: 75.26337123777101
Mr Mulligan however made
court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as
it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of
his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut
matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici
titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus
centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder
wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more
suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the
farmyard drake and duck.

Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper
man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with
animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics
while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had
advanced.<eos>: 48.864248497905365
The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a
passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his
nearest neighbour.<eos>: 44.18937830263678
Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for
whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him
a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional
assistance we could give?<eos>: 108.96663319915173
Who, upon his offer, thanked him very
heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he
was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne’s house, that was
in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman’s woe (and here he
fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place.<eos>: 120.71468012064877
Mr
Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether
his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an
ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due,
as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the
stomach.<eos>: 55.60771591762377
For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls,
smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable
droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex
though ’tis pity she’s a trollop): There’s a belly that never bore a
bastard.<eos>: 80.90167971592389
This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth
and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight.
The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some
larum in the antechamber.

Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little
fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion
with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient
point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the
obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by
a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had
not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but
contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was
ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it.<eos>: 73.36585202748154
_Mais bien
sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_.<eos>: 28.1788567442913
That
you may and very opportunely.<eos>: 38.32717033303553
There wanted nothing but this cup to
crown my felicity.<eos>: 109.98758441311377
But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in
my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept
of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give
thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver
of good things.<eos>: 61.74061396417185
With these words he approached the goblet to his lips,
took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening
his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very
picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.
Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he
said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting
instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her
feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so
melting a tenderness, ’pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been
impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands
of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever.<eos>: 103.72565749980443
I declare, I was never
so touched in all my life.<eos>: 65.09224374381087
God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days!
Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her
favours.<eos>: 122.55777607449266
A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having
replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.
Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great
and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in
thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished
coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of
maturer years.<eos>: 56.22513831376334
But indeed, sir, I wander from the point.<eos>: 26.71344823760924
How mingled
and imperfect are all our sublunary joys.<eos>: 17.69824292059969
Maledicity!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
he exclaimed in
anguish.<eos>: 14.32233850209004
Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my
cloak along!<eos>: 138.97307602317554
I could weep to think of it.<eos>: 22.28423087786314
Then, though it had poured
seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse.<eos>: 118.0234739355755
But beshrew me,
he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day
and, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur
Poyntz, from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the
French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting.<eos>: 65.27383969550584
Tut, tut!<eos>: 6.270866932394217
cries Le
Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most
accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in
a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape
Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even
the stoutest cloak.<eos>: 125.32068887197894
A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans
blague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest
posthaste to another world.<eos>: 49.32560678402445
Pooh!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
A _livre!_ cries Monsieur Lynch.<eos>: 53.81286836438194
The
clumsy things are dear at a sou.<eos>: 61.09302014435592
One umbrella, were it no bigger than a
fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps.<eos>: 80.95207016904328
No woman of any wit would
wear one.<eos>: 98.69849728247115
My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge
before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she
reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there
was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the
divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a
household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our
original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is
the fittest, nay, the only garment.<eos>: 100.84195609960302
The first, said she (and here my
pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my
attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear),
the first is a bath...<eos>: 116.75809284699798
But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall
cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of
our store of knowledge.

Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while
all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and,
having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with
a profound bow to the company.<eos>: 99.85410779790568
The presence even for a moment among a
party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and
not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of
the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of
ribaldry.<eos>: 64.6611376225978
Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.
A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh!<eos>: 61.430417914186336
I’ll be sworn she has rendezvoused
you.<eos>: 13.986219648488275
What, you dog?<eos>: 21.856897029740875
Have you a way with them?<eos>: 27.68023240476736
Gad’s bud, immensely so,
said Mr Lynch.<eos>: 34.24771112325968
The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater
hospice.<eos>: 33.712861720160134
Demme, does not Doctor O’Gargle chuck the nuns there under the
chin.<eos>: 72.07115266162374
As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been
wardmaid there any time these seven months.<eos>: 141.15909584206446
Lawksamercy, doctor, cried
the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and
with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body!<eos>: 50.75887959703613
Drat the
man!<eos>: 21.10964234840348
Bless me, I’m all of a wibbly wobbly.<eos>: 8.270320967140368
Why, you’re as bad as dear
little Father Cantekissem, that you are!<eos>: 34.046825000249925
May this pot of four half
choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way.<eos>: 76.5206789205116
I knows a lady
what’s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her.<eos>: 83.10616247313985
The young
surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as
the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward.
Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings
of the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable
fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy.<eos>: 69.42599258542894
I want patience,
said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to
instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence
due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth.<eos>: 96.5869051497871
I
am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of
witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far
from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human
breast.<eos>: 75.03475027855785
I cannot away with them.<eos>: 53.390214586638
What?<eos>: 3.8546952873351206
Malign such an one, the amiable
Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of
ours?<eos>: 53.544928559968426
And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child
of clay?<eos>: 50.004587961821926
Perish the thought!<eos>: 35.66236449019054
I shudder to think of the future of a race
where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right
reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne.<eos>: 75.2368467088539
Having
delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and
repaired to the door.<eos>: 87.85556259371135
A murmur of approval arose from all and some were
for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have
been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had
he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid
imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of
the true fold as ever drew breath.<eos>: 95.36916924592192
Stap my vitals, said he, them was
always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most
particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand
to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks
back on with a loving heart.

To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of
some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits
of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity.
The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as
overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were
difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and
outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were
they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of
strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf.<eos>: 77.37652526271056
But the word of Mr
Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch
that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born
out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into
the world, which the dint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent
indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of
creation’s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin.<eos>: 76.07514286519388
It was
now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had
passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a
wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his
heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting
them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that
plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn
and all find tolerable and but tolerable.<eos>: 51.551571782502606
To those who create
themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which
he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the
name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such
that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the
sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a
precipitate and inglorious retreat.<eos>: 104.97680512491458
Not but what he could feel with
mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the
gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy
Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far
forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a
gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions.<eos>: 76.64733595923957
To conclude, while
from the sister’s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was,
however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence
that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now
testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the
Supreme Being.

Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express
his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to
express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid
genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her
confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers.
The dressy young blade said it was her husband’s that put her in that
expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian
matron.<eos>: 65.84736884552686
I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table
so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum
was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring
through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he
calls her.<eos>: 66.27002638065069
I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event
would burst anon.<eos>: 118.4894331451411
’Slife, I’ll be round with you.<eos>: 15.56264797569131
I cannot but extol
the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another
child out of her.<eos>: 47.60975376309649
All fell to praising of it, each after his own
fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that
another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in
orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed
in every household.<eos>: 88.87637189865933
Singular, communed the guest with himself, the
wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that
the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the
seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic
titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of
levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise
eminent have esteemed the noblest.<eos>: 38.80920171812189
But, he further added, it is mayhap
to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have
more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.

But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron,
has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted
to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal
polity?<eos>: 82.96355511315986
Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have
counselled?<eos>: 68.23530783245079
During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary
advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that
moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a
tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per
cents?<eos>: 96.21948693168272
Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received?<eos>: 94.68123330997928
Or is
it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own
dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer?
Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady,
the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant
reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it
was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so.<eos>: 109.87422510424932
Unhappy
woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate
prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than
the derision of the desperate.<eos>: 36.75138576008725
He says this, a censor of morals, a very
pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of
nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn
from the lowest strata of society!<eos>: 35.83022113632498
Nay, had the hussy’s scouringbrush
not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with
Hagar, the Egyptian!<eos>: 65.30030525596736
In the question of the grazing lands his peevish
asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe’s hearing brought upon him from
an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as
straightforward as they were bucolic.<eos>: 32.21848034502182
It ill becomes him to preach that
gospel.<eos>: 62.7410454179371
Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the
want of the ploughshare?<eos>: 81.83224868308852
A habit reprehensible at puberty is second
nature and an opprobrium in middle life.<eos>: 76.83339906905964
If he must dispense his balm
of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to
health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist
better with the doctrines that now engross him.<eos>: 34.05995400057168
His marital breast is
the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce.<eos>: 35.208832856658994
The
lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort
neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of
ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native
orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but,
transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their
quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant,
acid and inoperative.

The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial
usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the
junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the
delegation that an heir had been born.<eos>: 62.376400811465224
When he had betaken himself to
the women’s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the
afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic
affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous
exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and
solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would
palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and
obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of
tongues.<eos>: 36.089636670705936
In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring
to urge, to mollify, to refrain.<eos>: 26.303975238501337
The moment was too propitious for the
display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union
among tempers so divergent.<eos>: 55.73087581036692
Every phase of the situation was
successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers,
the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that
rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as
the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr
Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused,
the rights of primogeniture and king’s bounty touching twins and
triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the
acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the
agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan)
in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the
medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other
spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation
of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the
vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in
the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix,
artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb
consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the
species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that
distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers
_Sturzgeburt,_ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and
monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of
consanguineous parents—in a word all the cases of human nativity which
Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic
illustrations.<eos>: 37.323576259668755
The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine
were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the
state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step
over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should
strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a
yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand
against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the
seat of castigation.<eos>: 48.70644931596807
The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole,
supernumerary digits, negro’s inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain
were alleged by one as a _prima facie_ and natural hypothetical
explanation of those swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel Steevens
was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born.<eos>: 34.753025284003336
The
hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and
worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for,
envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some
stage antecedent to the human.<eos>: 37.858495610513785
An outlandish delegate sustained against
both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the
theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his
authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of
the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down
to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses.<eos>: 85.00658172999744
The impression made by his
words was immediate but shortlived.<eos>: 128.44722792816495
It was effaced as easily as it had
been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of
pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as
the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man.<eos>: 59.77006541506495
Contemporaneously,
a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr
Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created
in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty
by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant
submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus.<eos>: 76.56186312300119
Hitherto silent, whether the
better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the
garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he
delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the
ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has
joined.

But Malachias’ tale began to freeze them with horror.<eos>: 89.94843764045791
He conjured up
the scene before them.<eos>: 26.78897328178598
The secret panel beside the chimney slid back
and in the recess appeared...<eos>: 100.23693137979063
Haines!<eos>: 10.29607537097122
Which of us did not feel his
flesh creep!<eos>: 81.66424274490437
He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand,
in the other a phial marked _Poison._ Surprise, horror, loathing were
depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin.<eos>: 83.66403295569248
I
anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for
which, it seems, history is to blame.<eos>: 48.204413923541594
Yes, it is true.<eos>: 13.496491984424884
I am the
murderer of Samuel Childs.<eos>: 29.80903782501344
And how I am punished!<eos>: 31.140963597702594
The inferno has no
terrors for me.<eos>: 13.701027735850388
This is the appearance is on me.<eos>: 26.853909601213303
Tare and ages, what
way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping
Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the
like of a soulth or a bullawurrus?<eos>: 98.26814685353963
My hell, and Ireland’s, is in this
life.<eos>: 29.631262323033518
It is what I tried to obliterate my crime.<eos>: 23.717167759812018
Distractions,
rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised
the phial to his lips), camping out.<eos>: 43.56718999878846
In vain!<eos>: 25.72335796464702
His spectre stalks me.
Dope is my only hope...<eos>: 33.175277597446474
Ah!<eos>: 4.727096607653369
Destruction!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
The black panther!<eos>: 40.90881938168676
With a cry
he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back.<eos>: 127.07287592396548
An instant later his head
appeared in the door opposite and said: Meet me at Westland Row station
at ten past eleven.<eos>: 142.24224939087105
He was gone.<eos>: 10.211924816527612
Tears gushed from the eyes of the
dissipated host.<eos>: 16.10573766105555
The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The
vendetta of Mananaun!<eos>: 22.931862558179297
The sage repeated: _Lex talionis_.<eos>: 27.06020671029591
The
sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense
debtorship for a thing done.<eos>: 45.489382549649996
Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased.
The mystery was unveiled.<eos>: 38.99513679297135
Haines was the third brother.<eos>: 29.052455981695903
His real name

Murderer’s ground.

What is the age of the soul of man?<eos>: 22.79779427949358
As she hath the virtue of the

No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing
the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a
modest substance in the funds.<eos>: 34.72069494147334
A score of years are blown away.<eos>: 50.6050776752961
He is
young Leopold.<eos>: 56.965069754335744
There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror
within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself.<eos>: 68.01398993677782
That young figure
of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from
the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel
on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a
mother’s thought.<eos>: 46.49176417833125
Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in
his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a
fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook,
a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright
trinketware (alas!<eos>: 111.23852606660537
a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of
compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out
upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but
the heart?<eos>: 63.145511182449724
tell me!) his studied baisemoins.<eos>: 34.039183329954476
The scent, the smile, but,
more than these, the dark eyes and oleaginous address, brought home at
duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm, seated with Jacob’s
pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you
may be sure, is aheating), reading through round horned spectacles some
paper from the Europe of a month before.<eos>: 90.72017430822771

Twilight
phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim
shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull.

Ominous
revengeful zodiacal host!<eos>: 27.700342827717016
They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned
and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the
giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all
their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.

Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible
gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood.<eos>: 20.10132287921916
And the equine
portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven’s
own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo.<eos>: 38.24983182895898
And lo,
wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger
of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin.<eos>: 61.157697737380225
It is she, Martha, thou lost
one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant.<eos>: 72.53700674948135
How serene does she
now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan
hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you
call it gossamer.<eos>: 52.71032720180306
It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and
loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on
currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply
swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a
myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled
sign upon the forehead of Taurus.

Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at
school together in Conmee’s time.<eos>: 86.2255444852731
He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades,
Pisistratus.<eos>: 8.255361557210037
Where were they now?<eos>: 21.174716407679355
Neither knew.<eos>: 20.984671608024627
You have spoken of the
past and its phantoms, Stephen said.<eos>: 23.854051325807532
Why think of them?<eos>: 18.0341522358798
If I call them
into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to
my call?<eos>: 73.01469859208795
Who supposes it?<eos>: 8.718016367589644
I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending
bard, am lord and giver of their life.<eos>: 30.151163762407577
He encircled his gadding hair
with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent.<eos>: 22.526354565111003
That answer and those
leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something
more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your
genius father.<eos>: 111.3533924549089
All who wish you well hope this for you.<eos>: 89.07418200187341
All desire to
see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you
Stephaneforos.<eos>: 50.6008215231197
I heartily wish you may not fail them.<eos>: 38.03803094033087
O no, Vincent
Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him.<eos>: 52.316332171226925
Have no fear.<eos>: 21.05517589623776
He
could not leave his mother an orphan.<eos>: 37.089559468630085
The young man’s face grew dark.
All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and
of his recent loss.<eos>: 88.89319447397462
He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the
noise of voices allayed the smart.<eos>: 80.421913059926
Madden had lost five drachmas on
Sceptre for a whim of the rider’s name: Lenehan as much more.<eos>: 50.90846446248761
He told
them of the race.<eos>: 18.530828847319214
The flag fell and, huuh!<eos>: 59.364685205150515
off, scamper, the mare ran
out freshly with O.<eos>: 28.81887358315843
Madden up.<eos>: 19.13923209693379
She was leading the field.<eos>: 26.2840935971044
All hearts
were beating.<eos>: 67.85538136466442
Even Phyllis could not contain herself.<eos>: 57.603976916124644
She waved her
scarf and cried: Huzzah!<eos>: 43.07906332548292
Sceptre wins!<eos>: 18.531428060990034
But in the straight on the run
home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level,
reached, outstripped her.<eos>: 177.1663319892402
All was lost now.<eos>: 35.93231910351211
Phyllis was silent: her
eyes were sad anemones.<eos>: 53.064686397983806
Juno, she cried, I am undone.<eos>: 14.190594740218884
But her lover
consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some
oval sugarplums which she partook.<eos>: 84.71397225021565
A tear fell: one only.<eos>: 112.61960719573563
A whacking
fine whip, said Lenehan, is W.<eos>: 46.25436315329083
Lane.<eos>: 2.6587979444591374
Four winners yesterday and three
today.<eos>: 58.13671704588682
What rider is like him?<eos>: 17.309286603045347
Mount him on the camel or the boisterous
buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his.<eos>: 33.53250832556129
But let us bear it
as was the ancient wont.<eos>: 88.53195751095565
Mercy on the luckless!<eos>: 11.374698711496677
Poor Sceptre!<eos>: 21.35534513281463
he said
with a light sigh.<eos>: 24.16581345425106
She is not the filly that she was.<eos>: 15.708899514690641
Never, by this
hand, shall we behold such another.<eos>: 89.53602729902994
By gad, sir, a queen of them.<eos>: 16.829470027062566
Do
you remember her, Vincent?<eos>: 30.26888203319624
I wish you could have seen my queen today,
Vincent said.<eos>: 49.867563581036656
How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair
beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the
right name of it.<eos>: 102.2466568618369
The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air
drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us.<eos>: 77.0715791395481
In
the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of
those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his
booth near the bridge.<eos>: 41.668543876321145
But she had nought for her teeth but the arm
with which I held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I
pressed too close.<eos>: 109.70532356264131
A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but
today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril.<eos>: 120.38974174079344
She is more taking then.
Her posies too!<eos>: 100.47353093349746
Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we
reclined together.<eos>: 89.62478923066955
And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who
met us as we left the field.<eos>: 53.8474024750259
Conmee himself!<eos>: 35.790623732390586
He was walking by the
hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty
letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page.<eos>: 57.70195725093364
The sweet creature
turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight
disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very
trees adore her.<eos>: 64.14826413628126
When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo
in that little mirror she carries.<eos>: 209.0648254680762
But he had been kind.<eos>: 19.202574098570643
In going by he
had blessed us.<eos>: 76.8448782538669
The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said.<eos>: 82.49210956435252
If I had poor
luck with Bass’s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more
propensely.<eos>: 90.81234547159622
He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and
withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.
Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence.<eos>: 55.24370167736812
His soul is far
away.<eos>: 25.67352326681612
It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be
born.<eos>: 65.65667469120754
Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the
incorruptible eon of the gods.<eos>: 31.00335370575945
Do you not think it, Stephen?<eos>: 24.306627807382547
Theosophos
told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian
priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law.<eos>: 64.90936753700119
The lords of the
moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of
the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were
therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second
constellation.

However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him
being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which
was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was
not the case at all.<eos>: 42.38589953433483
The individual whose visual organs while the above
was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of
animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody
that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty
speedily in the wrong shop.<eos>: 100.54275815208483
During the past four minutes or thereabouts
he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled
by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated
amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was
certainly calculated to attract anyone’s remark on account of its
scarlet appearance.<eos>: 105.46176625298904
He was simply and solely, as it subsequently
transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an
altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment
before’s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two
or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as
mutually innocent of as the babe unborn.<eos>: 100.18489226584246
Eventually, however, both
their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other
was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily
determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the
neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid
sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out
with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of
attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it
about the place.

The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the
course of life.<eos>: 68.46718958024972
Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity.<eos>: 101.0343239750658
The
debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on
the loftiest and most vital.<eos>: 22.27500117430054
The high hall of Horne’s house had never
beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old
rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so
encyclopaedic.<eos>: 64.87857169630075
A gallant scene in truth it made.<eos>: 105.74720975593966
Crotthers was there at
the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing
from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway.<eos>: 31.65152300880594
There too, opposite to
him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early
depravity and premature wisdom.<eos>: 120.78363843769387
Next the Scotchman was the place
assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in
stolid repose the squat form of Madden.<eos>: 60.29859895791063
The chair of the resident
indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the
figure of Bannon in explorer’s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide
brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred
manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan.<eos>: 115.14290963950597
Lastly at the head of the
board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of
pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of
Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated
the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that
vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained
by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and
constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever
efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired
pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.

It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted
transcendentalism to which Mr S.<eos>: 50.41367005197439
Dedalus’ (Div.<eos>: 32.570219481468676
Scep.) contentions
would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter
to accepted scientific methods.<eos>: 210.2786421125539
Science, it cannot be too often
repeated, deals with tangible phenomena.<eos>: 48.3281826593635
The man of science like the
man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked
and explain them as best he can.<eos>: 124.19238092338307
There may be, it is true, some
questions which science cannot answer—at present—such as the first
problem submitted by Mr L.<eos>: 171.35852251587008
Bloom (Pubb.<eos>: 14.284811695727708
Canv.) regarding the future
determination of sex.<eos>: 53.21718906242754
Must we accept the view of Empedocles of
Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert
others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long
neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is
it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper,
Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture
of both?<eos>: 35.79414347900543
This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature’s
favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on
the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus
felix_, of the passive element.<eos>: 29.766659548928484
The other problem raised by the same
inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality.<eos>: 113.19256940514873
It is interesting
because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but
we all die in different ways.<eos>: 74.4657739518347
Mr M.<eos>: 7.650525689360188
Mulligan (Hyg.<eos>: 14.250093359712256
et Eug.<eos>: 2.3851265294006665
Doc.) blames
the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract
adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc.<eos>: 26.0973982459631
by inhaling the bacteria which lurk
in dust.<eos>: 18.019110789305582
These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles
offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers
of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic
cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors
and unfructified duennas—these, he said, were accountable for any and
every fallingoff in the calibre of the race.<eos>: 32.724130496713805
Kalipedia, he prophesied,
would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely
good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive
pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as
Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all
these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular
condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner.<eos>: 81.56525927399414
Mr
J.<eos>: 3.698378786121965
Crotthers (Disc.<eos>: 53.746066196893004
Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to
abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy
labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by
far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in
the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or
in the atrocious crime of infanticide.<eos>: 45.61312911192383
Although the former (we are
thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of
nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too
rare to be normative.<eos>: 58.21687899054782
In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder
is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do,
all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which
often baulk nature in her intentions.<eos>: 74.14721311489082
An ingenious suggestion is that
thrown out by Mr V.<eos>: 56.23596131763763
Lynch (Bacc.<eos>: 13.606417200384223
Arith.) that both natality and
mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal
movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general,
everything, in fine, in nature’s vast workshop from the extinction of
some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which
beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet
unascertained.<eos>: 53.43274652065122
Still the plain straightforward question why a child of
normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly

Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and
cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths
are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous
germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively
shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend
to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an
arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings
(notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long
run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival
of the fittest.<eos>: 115.10695230311111

Dedalus’ (Div.<eos>: 32.570219481468676
Scep.) remark (or should it be
called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate,
deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with
pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous
females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not
to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly
find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals
as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above
alluded to.<eos>: 98.96574768698117
For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately
acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this
morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening
bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid
from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated
that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed
victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly
dropped from its mother.<eos>: 71.90962838795843
In a recent public controversy with Mr L.
Bloom (Pubb.<eos>: 48.50011241559403
Canv.) which took place in the commons’ hall of the
National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as
is well known, Dr A.<eos>: 83.14752953759876

I.) is the
able and popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having
stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete’s
allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of
all nature’s processes—the act of sexual congress) she must let it out
again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own.<eos>: 95.08609310118517
At the risk
of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the
less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was
delivered.

Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a
happy _accouchement._ It had been a weary weary while both for patient
and doctor.<eos>: 86.51861870325655
All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave
woman had manfully helped.<eos>: 91.7661988647784
She had.<eos>: 6.858647653767734
She had fought the good fight and
now she was very very happy.<eos>: 61.7215047918847
Those who have passed on, who have gone
before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching
scene.<eos>: 190.36673013888918
Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the
motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty
sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood,
breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal
Husband.<eos>: 110.58178998642167
And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one
blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy,
to lay in his arms that mite of God’s clay, the fruit of their lawful
embraces.<eos>: 116.30438863185465
He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle
stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity
has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank,
College Green branch.<eos>: 122.80786362156498
O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now,
it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses!<eos>: 75.91452504592502
With the old
shake of her pretty head she recalls those days.<eos>: 69.91707921485224

But their children are grouped in her
imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice,
Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances),
Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our
famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and
Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever
there was one, with the true Purefoy nose.<eos>: 115.79978707750792

No, let no

And Doady, knock the
ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the
curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light
whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so
with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest.<eos>: 149.8689424269046

own good time.<eos>: 46.205138765102134

your man’s part.<eos>: 81.29823007619667
Sir, to you my hand.<eos>: 37.54106990453321
Well done, thou good and faithful
servant!

There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil
memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the
heart but they abide there and wait.<eos>: 193.4000907459922
He may suffer their memory to grow
dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade
himself that they were not or at least were otherwise.<eos>: 91.07046909491574
Yet a chance
word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront
him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while
timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility
of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with
wine.<eos>: 136.16100398542076
Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies
under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but
shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote,
reproachful.

The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of
that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied
trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an
unhealthiness, a _flair,_ for the cruder things of life.<eos>: 75.15393264781648
A scene
disengages itself in the observer’s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a
word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present
there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures.<eos>: 91.29957898476825
A shaven space
of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at
Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game
but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward
over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief
alert shock.<eos>: 103.67458028559459
And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at
times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood,
Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of
arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of
them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin
so daintily against the cool ardent fruit.<eos>: 82.97578222161403
A lad of four or five in
linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth
when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the
urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands.<eos>: 114.60401675556392
He frowns a little
just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment
of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother
watches from the _piazzetta_ giving upon the flowerclose with a faint
shadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles Vergängliche_) in her glad
look.

Mark this farther and remember.<eos>: 163.19151626190472
The end comes suddenly.<eos>: 43.668238226876234
Enter that
antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their
faces.<eos>: 51.904394798959544
Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent.<eos>: 34.07645857786177
Quietude of
custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant
watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long
ago.<eos>: 45.39662402400286
But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with
preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended,
compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched
field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in
an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of
the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was
the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of
the word.

_(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a large mango fruit,
offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof, then droops
his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel.<eos>: 39.569836610931354

stoops his back for leapfrog.)_

trinketed stomacher, a slow friendly mockery in her eyes.)_ O Poldy,

BLOOM: Yes, ma’am?

MARION: _Ti trema un poco il cuore?_

     There’s someone in the house, I know,

_(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling,
chortling, trumming, twanging, they diddle diddle cakewalk dance
away.)_

BLOOM: _(With a sour tenderish smile.)_ A little frivol, shall we, if
you are so inclined?<eos>: 34.94483132632114
Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for
a fraction of a second?

MRS BREEN: _(Screams gaily.)_ O, you ruck!<eos>: 31.94711328577108
You ought to see yourself!

BLOOM: For old sake’ sake.<eos>: 39.177109397510826
I only meant a square party, a mixed
marriage mingling of our different little conjugials.<eos>: 147.6071981009732
You know I had a
soft corner for you.<eos>: 39.54585681469462

_(She
puts out her hand inquisitively.)_ What are you hiding behind your
back?<eos>: 39.30973894464205
Tell us, there’s a dear.

BLOOM: _(Seizes her wrist with his free hand.)_ Josie Powell that was,
prettiest deb in Dublin.<eos>: 19.498433709174186
How time flies by!<eos>: 199.42891159393966
Do you remember, harking
back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night, Georgina
Simpson’s housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game,
finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading?<eos>: 59.01181051114153
Subject, what is in this
snuffbox?

MRS BREEN: You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic
recitation and you looked the part.<eos>: 31.201930539156606
You were always a favourite with
the ladies.

BLOOM: _(Squire of dames, in dinner jacket with wateredsilk facings,
blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl
studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.)_ Ladies and
gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.

MRS BREEN: The dear dead days beyond recall.<eos>: 62.03569439956651
Love’s old sweet song.

BLOOM: _(Meaningfully dropping his voice.)_ I confess I’m teapot with
curiosity to find out whether some person’s something is a little
teapot at present.

fingers and thumb passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm
which she surrenders gently.)_ The witching hour of night.<eos>: 51.01749558681977
I took the
splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly.<eos>: 33.23531885457494

on her finger a ruby ring.) Là ci darem la mano._

MRS BREEN: _(In a onepiece evening frock executed in moonlight blue, a
tinsel sylph’s diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her
moonblue satin slipper, curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.)

You’re scalding!<eos>: 5.588131816578486

heart.

BLOOM: When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and
the beast.<eos>: 100.34566852609304
I can never forgive you for that.<eos>: 30.149470119995744
_(His clenched fist at his
brow.)_ Think what it means.<eos>: 39.39286699726063
All you meant to me then.<eos>: 24.664212828080696

shuffles past them in carpet slippers, his dull beard thrust out,
muttering to right and left.<eos>: 47.9400021667657

the ace of spades, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)_

ALF BERGAN: _(Points jeering at the sandwichboards.)_ U.<eos>: 31.180836924625453
p: up.

MRS BREEN: _(To Bloom.)_ High jinks below stairs.<eos>: 20.34628611894814
_(She gives him the
glad eye.)_ Why didn’t you kiss the spot to make it well?<eos>: 41.294123090739895
You wanted
to.

BLOOM: _(Shocked.)_ Molly’s best friend!<eos>: 15.657759184479744
Could you?

MRS BREEN: _(Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.)_
Hnhn.<eos>: 24.693563461121098
The answer is a lemon.<eos>: 32.19787301663663
Have you a little present for me there?

BLOOM: _(Offhandedly.)_ Kosher.<eos>: 13.056190369258223

potted meat is incomplete.<eos>: 110.59594778867621

weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which
a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash.<eos>: 69.35802322054761
He opens it and
shows it full of polonies, kippered herrings, Findon haddies and
tightpacked pills.)_

RICHIE: Best value in Dub.

_(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his
napkin, waiting to wait.)_

PAT: _(Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.)_ Steak and

by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)_

RICHIE: _(With a cry of pain, his hand to his back.)_ Ah!<eos>: 22.901378102660605

BLOOM: _(Points to the navvy.)_ A spy.<eos>: 13.725286899141496

I hate
stupid crowds.<eos>: 26.302710545364604
I am not on pleasure bent.<eos>: 103.71338550297719
I am in a grave predicament.

MRS BREEN: Humbugging and deluthering as per usual with your cock and
bull story.

BLOOM: I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here.
But you must never tell.<eos>: 54.665464453871586
Not even Molly.<eos>: 31.555186838907733
I have a most particular
reason.

MRS BREEN: _(All agog.)_ O, not for worlds.

BLOOM: Let’s walk on.<eos>: 23.744848391967135
Shall us?

MRS BREEN: Let’s.

_(The bawd makes an unheeded sign.<eos>: 29.912203886988063
Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen.<eos>: 39.44180381572478
The
terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)_

THE BAWD: Jewman’s melt!

BLOOM: _(In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel,
tony buff shirt, shepherd’s plaid Saint Andrew’s cross scarftie, white
spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in
bandolier and a grey billycock hat.)_ Do you remember a long long time,
years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was
weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?

MRS BREEN: _(In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider
veil.)_ Leopardstown.

BLOOM: I mean, Leopardstown.<eos>: 31.805080228027894
And Molly won seven shillings on a three
year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old
fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and
you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur
that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to
nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and
I’ll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...

MRS BREEN: She did, of course, the cat!<eos>: 79.16432791487024
Don’t tell me!<eos>: 5.531225136830445
Nice adviser!

BLOOM: Because it didn’t suit you one quarter as well as the other
ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I
admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though
it was a pity to kill it, you cruel naughty creature, little mite of a
thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.

MRS BREEN: _(Squeezes his arm, simpers.)_ Naughty cruel I was!

BLOOM: _(Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.)_ And Molly was eating a
sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher’s lunch basket.
Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much
for her style.<eos>: 66.20758117589872
She was...

MRS BREEN: Too...

BLOOM: Yes.<eos>: 21.790004220713246
And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O’Reilly
were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius
Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter,
Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you
asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across...

MRS BREEN: _(Eagerly.)_ Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

_(She fades from his side.<eos>: 49.282481197594926
Followed by the whining dog he walks on
towards hellsgates.<eos>: 26.043757967267748
In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her
feet apart, pisses cowily.<eos>: 57.15431760358544
Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers
listen to a tale which their brokensnouted gaffer rasps out with
raucous humour.<eos>: 39.62131747453731
An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in
maimed sodden playfight.)_

THE GAFFER: _(Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.)_ And when
Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver street what was he
after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there
waiting on the shavings for Derwan’s plasterers.

THE LOITERERS: _(Guffaw with cleft palates.)_ O jays!

_(Their paintspeckled hats wag.<eos>: 25.73537674178169
Spattered with size and lime of their
lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)_

BLOOM: Coincidence too.<eos>: 31.43593974897945
They think it funny.<eos>: 40.92793730462092
Anything but that.<eos>: 16.546242213739838
Broad
daylight.<eos>: 18.54403757849175
Trying to walk.<eos>: 14.695747616303317

THE LOITERERS: Jays, that’s a good one.<eos>: 16.49390768788306

O jays, into the
men’s porter.

_(Bloom passes.<eos>: 20.75602913200866
Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled,
call from lanes, doors, corners.)_

THE WHORES:

Are you going far, queer fellow?

How’s your middle leg?

Got a match on you?

Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.

_(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond.<eos>: 39.87965084997313
From
a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk.
In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two
redcoats.)_

THE NAVVY: _(Belching.)_ Where’s the bloody house?

THE SHEBEENKEEPER: Purdon street.<eos>: 25.849674020835142
Shilling a bottle of stout.
Respectable woman.

THE NAVVY: _(Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.)_
Come on, you British army!

PRIVATE CARR: _(Behind his back.)_ He aint half balmy.

PRIVATE COMPTON: _(Laughs.)_ What ho!

PRIVATE CARR: _(To the navvy.)_ Portobello barracks canteen.<eos>: 20.453063857453614
You ask
for Carr.<eos>: 57.53326123053285
Just Carr.

THE NAVVY: _(Shouts.)_

     We are the boys.<eos>: 23.979077820911208
Of Wexford.

PRIVATE COMPTON: Say!<eos>: 34.553507996937135
What price the sergeantmajor?

PRIVATE CARR: Bennett?<eos>: 39.53286480751485
He’s my pal.<eos>: 7.123448279426972
I love old Bennett.

THE NAVVY: _(Shouts.)_

     The galling chain.
     And free our native land.

_(He staggers forward, dragging them with him.<eos>: 34.12302266769937
Bloom stops, at fault.

A pure mare’s nest.<eos>: 25.167572084162806

I live in Eccles street.

I
don’t see it, that’s all.<eos>: 7.587114371568454
No born gentleman, no-one with the most
rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly
loathsome conduct.<eos>: 40.127076512528404
One of those, my lord.<eos>: 38.23150179507779
A plagiarist.<eos>: 3.4811936918257143
A soapy sneak
masquerading as a literateur.<eos>: 7.936225907096099
It’s perfectly obvious that with the most
inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling copy, really
gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath
suspicion.<eos>: 78.8380948343732
The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions, with which
your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout
the kingdom.

BLOOM: _(Murmurs with hangdog meekness glum.)_ That bit about the
laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may...

BEAUFOY: _(His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.)_ You
funny ass, you!<eos>: 56.5513793018678
You’re too beastly awfully weird for words!<eos>: 33.96407994148114

I presume, my lord,
we shall receive the usual witnesses’ fees, shan’t we?<eos>: 73.55864560598525
We are
considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this
jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.

BLOOM: _(Indistinctly.)_ University of life.<eos>: 36.54667546148745
Bad art.

BEAUFOY: _(Shouts.)_ It’s a damnably foul lie, showing the moral
rottenness of the man!<eos>: 31.525710003016933
_(He extends his portfolio.)_ We have here
damning evidence, the _corpus delicti_, my lord, a specimen of my
maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.

A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY:

BLOOM: _(Bravely.)_ Overdrawn.

FIRST WATCH: The King versus Bloom.<eos>: 25.825655279671103
Call the woman Driscoll.

THE CRIER: Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!

_(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches.<eos>: 38.30273878432207
She has a bucket
on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)_

SECOND WATCH: Another!<eos>: 31.369311272817804
Are you of the unfortunate class?

MARY DRISCOLL: _(Indignantly.)_ I’m not a bad one.<eos>: 17.790736750074412
I bear a respectable
character and was four months in my last place.<eos>: 92.71489381411298
I was in a situation,
six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out and I had to leave
owing to his carryings on.

FIRST WATCH: What do you tax him with?

MARY DRISCOLL: He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of
myself as poor as I am.

BLOOM: _(In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless
slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled: softly.)_ I treated you white.<eos>: 50.1129237918398
I
gave you mementos, smart emerald garters far above your station.
Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering.
There’s a medium in all things.<eos>: 66.28125934633464
Play cricket.

MARY DRISCOLL: _(Excitedly.)_ As God is looking down on me this night
if ever I laid a hand to them oylsters!

FIRST WATCH: The offence complained of?<eos>: 54.46339419030824
Did something happen?

MARY DRISCOLL: He surprised me in the rere of the premises, Your
honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for
a safety pin.<eos>: 69.2306666368975
He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a
result.<eos>: 39.37752926175273
And he interfered twict with my clothing.

BLOOM: She counterassaulted.

MARY DRISCOLL: _(Scornfully.)_ I had more respect for the
scouringbrush, so I had.<eos>: 24.193026722144012
I remonstrated with him, Your lord, and he
remarked: keep it quiet.

_(General laughter.)_

GEORGE FOTTRELL: _(Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.)_ Order in
court!<eos>: 41.41911270981866
The accused will now make a bogus statement.

_(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins
a long unintelligible speech.<eos>: 79.40905049442412
They would hear what counsel had to say
in his stirring address to the grand jury.<eos>: 98.26821798798025
He was down and out but,
though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to
reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and
return to nature as a purely domestic animal.<eos>: 52.16796130559362
A sevenmonths’ child, he
had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent.
There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn
over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping
post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by
the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family.<eos>: 50.16327030445165
An
acclimatised Britisher, he had seen that summer eve from the footplate
of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain
refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of
loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly
rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell’s wallpaper at one
and ninepence a dozen, innocent Britishborn bairns lisping prayers to
the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums or
model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour
reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the
boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what
times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with
four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain
ever...._

_(Renewed laughter.<eos>: 64.18943697918334
He mumbles incoherently.<eos>: 4.984024977296839
Reporters complain that
they cannot hear.)_

LONGHAND AND SHORTHAND: _(Without looking up from their notebooks.)_
Loosen his boots.

PROFESSOR MACHUGH: _(From the presstable, coughs and calls.)_ Cough it
up, man.<eos>: 30.72833407438139

a voice of pained protest.)_ This is no place for indecent levity at
the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor.<eos>: 24.26144490979415

stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny.<eos>: 114.81197330393131
The trumped up
misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on
by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence
being quite permitted in my client’s native place, the land of the
Pharaoh.<eos>: 47.41987773585051

My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the

MRS YELVERTON BARRY: _(In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength
ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brickquilted dolman, a comb of
brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.)_ Arrest him, constable.
He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband
was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed
James Lovebirch.<eos>: 27.03153451360516
He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless

I deeply inflamed him, he said.<eos>: 12.927728380337049

on
the following Thursday, Dunsink time.<eos>: 43.066002611672694
He offered to send me through the
post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled _The Girl
with the Three Pairs of Stays_.

MRS BELLINGHAM: _(In cap and seal coney mantle, wrapped up to the nose,
steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell
quizzing-glasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.)_
Also to me.<eos>: 59.63800912381466
Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person.<eos>: 20.62759384212097
Because
he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker’s one sleety day
during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the
wastepipe and the ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen.<eos>: 74.45705782798838
Subsequently
he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in
my honour.<eos>: 24.996299477508003
I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the
information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant
purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.

MRS YELVERTON BARRY: Shame on him!

_(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins surges forward.)_

Bluebeard!<eos>: 11.69845429972476
Three cheers for Ikey Mo!

SECOND WATCH: _(Produces handcuffs.)_ Here are the darbies.

MRS BELLINGHAM: He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome
compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my
frostbound coachman Palmer while in the same breath he expressed
himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his
fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing
my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon
garnished sable, a buck’s head couped or.<eos>: 65.42511014948542
He lauded almost
extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose
drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden
treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up.<eos>: 50.27182298156234
He
urged me (Stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me.) to
defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible
opportunity.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(In amazon costume, hard hat,
jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets
with braided drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she
strikes her welt constantly.)_ Also me.<eos>: 64.19135947095542
Because he saw me on the polo
ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of
Ireland.<eos>: 42.80563317133657
My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger
Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob
_Centaur._ This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car
and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold
after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady.<eos>: 105.61395461992929
I have it still.
It represents a partially nude señorita, frail and lovely (his wife, as
he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit
intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard.<eos>: 61.547319425362005
He urged me
to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison.<eos>: 33.20699547778459
He
implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise
him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most
vicious horsewhipping.

MRS BELLINGHAM: Me too.

MRS YELVERTON BARRY: Me too.

_(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters
received from Bloom.)_

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Stamps her jingling spurs in a
sudden paroxysm of fury.)_ I will, by the God above me.<eos>: 46.9803088613989
I’ll scourge
the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him.<eos>: 18.771071756066327

Again!<eos>: 11.241623448718054

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Laughs derisively.)_ O, did you,
my fine fellow?<eos>: 14.759412993129327
Well, by the living God, you’ll get the surprise of
your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever
bargained for.<eos>: 48.18648218454131
You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into
fury.

MRS BELLINGHAM: _(Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.)_
Make him smart, Hanna dear.<eos>: 35.20641520606574
Give him ginger.<eos>: 23.46741693288569

O shivery!<eos>: 7.200767034583973
It was your ambrosial beauty.<eos>: 22.973950672307726

Let me off this once.<eos>: 58.61187157335251
_(He offers the other cheek.)_

MRS YELVERTON BARRY: _(Severely.)_ Don’t do so on any account, Mrs
Talboys!<eos>: 29.767517704132754
He should be soundly trounced!

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Unbuttoning her gauntlet
violently.)_ I’ll do no such thing.<eos>: 15.678214629133933
Pigdog and always was ever since he
was pupped!<eos>: 59.11096548600358
To dare address me!<eos>: 105.20862683284038
I’ll flog him black and blue in the
public streets.<eos>: 34.53241817520458
I’ll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel.<eos>: 14.676338967068396

Ambidexterity is also latent.
He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in
consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth.<eos>: 42.84753490017183
In consequence of a
family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to
be more sinned against than sinning.<eos>: 69.04499913223044

examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal,

Many have found him a dear man, a dear person.<eos>: 110.75489681127937
He is a rather quaint
fellow on the whole, coy though not feebleminded in the medical sense.
He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the
court missionary of the Reformed Priests’ Protection Society which
clears up everything.<eos>: 81.5971453491495
He is practically a total abstainer and I can
affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food,
cold dried grocer’s peas.<eos>: 39.725221164105
He wears a hairshirt of pure Irish
manufacture winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday.<eos>: 77.71712948271885

Tyler, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry
Irving, Rip van Winkle, Kossuth, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold
Rothschild, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes, Pasteur, turns each foot
simultaneously in different directions, bids the tide turn back,

Farewell.

ZOE: _(Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.)_ Honest?<eos>: 13.428346851085767
Till the next
time.<eos>: 9.310469695606598
_(She sneers.)_ Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or
came too quick with your best girl.<eos>: 51.967632510802915
O, I can read your thoughts!

BLOOM: _(Bitterly.)_ Man and woman, love, what is it?<eos>: 18.459778147517007
A cork and
bottle.<eos>: 50.19037627647701
I’m sick of it.<eos>: 14.957133361858176
Let everything rip.

ZOE: _(In sudden sulks.)_ I hate a rotter that’s insincere.<eos>: 15.054228157320845
Give a
bleeding whore a chance.

BLOOM: _(Repentantly.)_ I am very disagreeable.<eos>: 15.375850226354945
You are a necessary
evil.<eos>: 39.59924226636922
Where are you from?<eos>: 25.915322951808
London?

ZOE: _(Glibly.)_ Hog’s Norton where the pigs plays the organs.<eos>: 21.99132806954451
I’m
Yorkshire born.<eos>: 12.671268276632116
_(She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.)_
I say, Tommy Tittlemouse.<eos>: 26.24824914269454
Stop that and begin worse.<eos>: 51.08251426333086
Have you cash for
a short time?<eos>: 41.130983544062616
Ten shillings?

BLOOM: _(Smiles, nods slowly.)_ More, houri, more.

ZOE: And more’s mother?<eos>: 33.4981772263571
_(She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.)_
Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola?<eos>: 30.028846180448785
Come and I’ll
peel off.

BLOOM: _(Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled
embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled
pears.)_ Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew.<eos>: 19.192448371186522
The
greeneyed monster.<eos>: 12.688817964357447
_(Earnestly.)_ You know how difficult it is.<eos>: 23.355900161795148
I
needn’t tell you.

ZOE: _(Flattered.)_ What the eye can’t see the heart can’t grieve for.
_(She pats him.)_ Come.

BLOOM: Laughing witch!<eos>: 18.662380196871514
The hand that rocks the cradle.

ZOE: Babby!

BLOOM: _(In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair,
fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a
chubby finger, his moist tongue lolling and lisping.)_ One two tlee:
tlee tlwo tlone.

THE BUCKLES: Love me.<eos>: 29.882114993709017
Love me not.<eos>: 16.037544101848813
Love me.

ZOE: Silent means consent.<eos>: 40.05085885581786
_(With little parted talons she captures his
hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the passtouch of secret
monitor, luring him to doom.)_ Hot hands cold gizzard.

_(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations.<eos>: 39.053486189351084
She leads him towards
the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her
painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the
lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)_

THE MALE BRUTES: _(Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in
their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and
fro.)_ Good!

_(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated.
They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile
to his hasty bow.<eos>: 61.15844813750669
He trips awkwardly.)_

ZOE: _(Her lucky hand instantly saving him.)_ Hoopsa!<eos>: 18.995682140531372
Don’t fall
upstairs.

BLOOM: The just man falls seven times.<eos>: 51.85541303601336
_(He stands aside at the
threshold.)_ After you is good manners.

ZOE: Ladies first, gentlemen after.

_(She crosses the threshold.<eos>: 30.36077684142091
He hesitates.<eos>: 4.799424088923303
She turns and, holding out
her hands, draws him over.<eos>: 52.422434863707274
He hops.<eos>: 4.799424088923303
On the antlered rack of the hall
hang a man’s hat and waterproof.<eos>: 16.723349150420187
Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing
them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied.<eos>: 53.21238846960316
A door on the return landing is
flung open.<eos>: 149.7398590232755
A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked,
passes with an ape’s gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld,
hugging a full waterjugjar, his twotailed black braces dangling at
heels.<eos>: 54.933401277597405
Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the
halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head
sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom.<eos>: 84.20278539905921
A shade of mauve tissuepaper
dims the light of the chandelier.<eos>: 27.80841864485666
Round and round a moth flies,
colliding, escaping.<eos>: 32.329910989306356
The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of
jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids.<eos>: 20.92417571347793
Footmarks are stamped over it in
all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a
morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage
higgledypiggledy.<eos>: 82.24361870152758
The walls are tapestried with a paper of yewfronds
and clear glades.<eos>: 36.909027501267786
In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers.
Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearthrug of matted hair, his cap back
to the front.<eos>: 24.673206775128527
With a wand he beats time slowly.<eos>: 107.9862004225845
Kitty Ricketts, a bony
pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral
wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the
table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over
the mantelpiece.<eos>: 79.397224994492
A tag of her corsetlace hangs slightly below her
jacket.<eos>: 56.91862401799791
Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)_

KITTY: _(Coughs behind her hand.)_ She’s a bit imbecillic.<eos>: 15.880969992354318
_(She signs
with a waggling forefinger.)_ Blemblem.<eos>: 19.687182265209717
_(Lynch lifts up her skirt and
white petticoat with the wand.<eos>: 49.28493012491466
She settles them down quickly.)_ Respect
yourself.<eos>: 37.87227773870987
_(She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which
her hair glows, red with henna.)_ O, excuse!

ZOE: More limelight, Charley.<eos>: 40.54238710099365
_(She goes to the chandelier and turns
the gas full cock.)_

KITTY: _(Peers at the gasjet.)_ What ails it tonight?

LYNCH: _(Deeply.)_ Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.

ZOE: Clap on the back for Zoe.

_(The wand in Lynch’s hand flashes: a brass poker.<eos>: 29.307206973070908
Stephen stands at
the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant.<eos>: 35.52433362689764
With two fingers he
repeats once more the series of empty fifths.<eos>: 92.3230645759735
Florry Talbot, a blond
feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry,
lolls spreadeagle in the sofacorner, her limp forearm pendent over the
bolster, listening.<eos>: 22.20215173062763
A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)_

KITTY: _(Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.)_ O, excuse!

ZOE: _(Promptly.)_ Your boy’s thinking of you.<eos>: 19.494521643404845
Tie a knot on your
shift.

_(Kitty Ricketts bends her head.<eos>: 48.889470229698205
Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over
her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground.<eos>: 44.785835487506425
Lynch lifts the curled
catterpillar on his wand.<eos>: 31.77265318376244
She snakes her neck, nestling.<eos>: 12.622415116833428
Stephen
glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)_

STEPHEN: As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto
Marcello found it or made it.<eos>: 72.57318598789912
The rite is the poet’s rest.<eos>: 27.65362421260734
It may be an
old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate _Cœla enarrant gloriam Domini._
It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and
mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round
David’s that is Circe’s or what am I saying Ceres’ altar and David’s
tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about the alrightness of
his almightiness.<eos>: 40.993873206548415
_Mais nom de nom,_ that is another pair of trousers.
_Jetez la gourme.<eos>: 27.799115586724948
Faut que jeunesse se passe.<eos>: 3.642765346693839

Lynch’s cap, smiles, laughs.)_ Which side is your knowledge bump?

Bah!

STEPHEN: You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts,
mistakes.<eos>: 29.057069144423345
How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty?
Whetstone!

THE CAP: Bah!

STEPHEN: Here’s another for you.<eos>: 37.235332347023075
_(He frowns.)_ The reason is because
the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible
interval which...

THE CAP: Which?<eos>: 39.1525474042115
Finish.<eos>: 3.718087024428193
You can’t.

STEPHEN: _(With an effort.)_ Interval which.<eos>: 21.967950642888585

THE CAP: Which?

_(Outside the gramophone begins to blare_ The Holy City.)

STEPHEN: _(Abruptly.)_ What went forth to the ends of the world to
traverse not itself, God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller,
having itself traversed in reality itself becomes that self.<eos>: 58.99511000883197
Wait a

Wait a second.<eos>: 17.355758785834468
Damn that fellow’s noise in the street.<eos>: 15.101628242082457
Self
which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become.<eos>: 52.483958277082
_Ecco!_

LYNCH: _(With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe
Higgins.)_ What a learned speech, eh?

ZOE: _(Briskly.)_ God help your head, he knows more than you have
forgotten.

_(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)_

FLORRY: They say the last day is coming this summer.

KITTY: No!

ZOE: _(Explodes in laughter.)_ Great unjust God!

FLORRY: _(Offended.)_ Well, it was in the papers about Antichrist.<eos>: 32.10279156006727
O,
my foot’s tickling.

yelling.)_

from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills.<eos>: 35.19711501465964
Aloft over
his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden
huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the
slack of its breeches.<eos>: 68.04648180860956
A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello,
hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead
and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering
darkness.)_

ALL: What?

THE HOBGOBLIN: _(His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his
eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping with outstretched clutching arms, then
all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.)

He springs off into vacuum.)_

FLORRY: _(Sinking into torpor, crossing herself secretly.)_ The end of
the world!

Nebulous obscurity

Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares
over coughs and feetshuffling.)_

THE GRAMOPHONE:

     Hosanna...

_(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts.<eos>: 50.18227489322139
A white star falls from it,
proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah.
Along an infinite invisible tightrope taut from zenith to nadir the End
of the World, a twoheaded octopus in gillie’s kilts, busby and tartan
filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the form of the
Three Legs of Man.)_

THE END OF THE WORLD: _(With a Scotch accent.)_ Wha’ll dance the keel
row, the keel row, the keel row?

harsh as a corncrake’s, jars on high.<eos>: 34.690396201994155

STEPHEN: Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.

FLORRY: Are you out of Maynooth?<eos>: 59.754582050957616

business with his coat buttoned up.<eos>: 77.66969610420074
You needn’t try to hide, I says to
him.<eos>: 31.51015332073465

BLOOM: Poor man!

ZOE: _(Lightly.)_ Only for what happened him.

BLOOM: How?

VIRAG: _(A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage,
cranes his scraggy neck forward.<eos>: 32.387081200452045
He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.)
Verfluchte Goim!_ He had a father, forty fathers.<eos>: 25.676915132707325

jovially in base barreltone.)_ When love absorbs my ardent soul.

STEPHEN: _(Devoutly.)_ And sovereign Lord of all things.

FLORRY: _(To Stephen.)_ I’m sure you’re a spoiled priest.<eos>: 23.44584744139598
Or a monk.

LYNCH: He is.<eos>: 15.358807981530862
A cardinal’s son.

STEPHEN: Cardinal sin.<eos>: 41.483449906410186
Monks of the screw.

_(His Eminence Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland,
appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks.
Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his
train, peeping under it.<eos>: 53.20294661144285
He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his
head.<eos>: 59.40986076568746
His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread.
Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a
corkscrew cross.<eos>: 61.42898296301496
Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high
with large wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp:)_

THE CARDINAL:

     Conservio lies captured
     He lies in the lowest dungeon
     With manacles and chains around his limbs
     Weighing upwards of three tons.

_(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left
cheek puffed out.<eos>: 62.78051887181684
Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to
and fro, arms akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour:)_

     O, the poor little fellow
     Hihihihihis legs they were yellow
     He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake
     But some bloody savage
     To graize his white cabbage
     He murdered Nell Flaherty’s duckloving drake.

_(A multitude of midges swarms white over his robe.<eos>: 78.25701875329707
He scratches
himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims:)_

I’m suffering the agony of the damned.<eos>: 39.36994964136588
By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to
Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous.<eos>: 87.61356018005128
If they were they’d
walk me off the face of the bloody globe.

_(His head aslant he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers,
imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his
hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his
trainbearers.<eos>: 51.01277216019111
The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling,
Easterkissing, zigzag behind him.<eos>: 11.066273992577507
His voice is heard mellow from afar,
merciful male, melodious:)_

     Shall carry my heart to thee,
     Shall carry my heart to thee,
     And the breath of the balmy night
     Shall carry my heart to thee!

 _(The trick doorhandle turns.)_

THE DOORHANDLE: Theeee!

ZOE: The devil is in that door.

_(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking
the waterproof and hat from the rack.<eos>: 66.9302420130756
Bloom starts forward
involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the
chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)_

ZOE: _(Sniffs his hair briskly.)_ Hmmm!<eos>: 42.11039487281849
Thank your mother for the
rabbits.<eos>: 11.461181769601513
I’m very fond of what I like.

BLOOM: _(Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep,
pricks his ears.)_ If it were he?<eos>: 34.93632251583997
After?<eos>: 8.579746493155652
Or because not?<eos>: 34.6100880821975
Or the double
event?

ZOE: _(Tears open the silverfoil.)_ Fingers was made before forks.
_(She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts
and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.)_ No objection to French lozenges?
_(He nods.<eos>: 47.17926124213164
She taunts him.)_ Have it now or wait till you get it?<eos>: 35.51413519915085
_(He
opens his mouth, his head cocked.<eos>: 20.89599215153355
She whirls the prize in left circle.
His head follows.<eos>: 123.18251910421435
She whirls it back in right circle.<eos>: 63.23871592581677
He eyes her.)_
Catch!

_(She tosses a piece.<eos>: 53.475933269168486
With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it
through with a crack.)_

KITTY: _(Chewing.)_ The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have
lovely ones.<eos>: 60.358052637298215
Full of the best liqueurs.<eos>: 11.802135855055269
And the viceroy was there with
his lady.<eos>: 40.77805595826186
The gas we had on the Toft’s hobbyhorses.<eos>: 19.147220414248807

BLOOM: _(In Svengali’s fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic
forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance
towards the door.<eos>: 21.696134403931527
Then rigid with left foot advanced he makes a swift
pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing
his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.)_ Go, go, go, I conjure
you, whoever you are!

_(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside.
Bloom’s features relax.<eos>: 93.71771304264264
He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing
calmly.<eos>: 24.863027154378667
Zoe offers him chocolate.)_

BLOOM: _(Solemnly.)_ Thanks.

ZOE: Do as you’re bid.<eos>: 35.53819061331377
Here!

_(A firm heelclacking tread is heard on the stairs.)_

BLOOM: _(Takes the chocolate.)_ Aphrodisiac?<eos>: 15.63150509926277
Tansy and pennyroyal.<eos>: 3.9376064701459472

_(The door opens.<eos>: 15.527210234055001
Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress, enters.<eos>: 16.968227514503106
She is
dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with
tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like
Minnie Hauck in_ Carmen.<eos>: 37.609495740299714
_On her left hand are wedding and keeper
rings.<eos>: 89.29512668342493

Her
olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed with orangetainted

She has large pendant beryl eardrops.)_

BELLA: My word!<eos>: 30.00453048695088
I’m all of a mucksweat.

_(She glances round her at the couples.<eos>: 18.81602492594752
Then her eyes rest on Bloom
with hard insistence.<eos>: 88.52142701225583
Her large fan winnows wind towards her heated
faceneck and embonpoint.<eos>: 31.700068928631325
Her falcon eyes glitter.)_

THE FAN: _(Flirting quickly, then slowly.)_ Married, I see.

BLOOM: Yes.<eos>: 16.116867685697837
Partly, I have mislaid...

THE FAN: _(Half opening, then closing.)_ And the missus is master.
Petticoat government.

BLOOM: _(Looks down with a sheepish grin.)_ That is so.

THE FAN: _(Folding together, rests against her left eardrop.)_ Have you
forgotten me?

BLOOM: Nes.<eos>: 24.610657832750494
Yo.

THE FAN: _(Folded akimbo against her waist.)_ Is me her was you dreamed
before?<eos>: 39.833782306160344
Was then she him you us since knew?<eos>: 486.3561829594655
Am all them and the same
now we?

_(Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)_

BLOOM: _(Wincing.)_ Powerful being.<eos>: 32.866880815789706
In my eyes read that slumber which
women love.

THE FAN: _(Tapping.)_ We have met.<eos>: 59.11274202976021
You are mine.<eos>: 15.032317865910215
It is fate.

BLOOM: _(Cowed.)_ Exuberant female.<eos>: 15.641534954129105
Enormously I desiderate your
domination.<eos>: 13.2909380600604
I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young.<eos>: 57.41041759496847
I stand, so to
speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before
the too late box of the general postoffice of human life.<eos>: 107.61503155430724
The door and
window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per
second according to the law of falling bodies.<eos>: 127.55973465564148
I have felt this instant
a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle.<eos>: 38.245150105556775
It runs in our family.
Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it.<eos>: 73.20799417253717
He believed
in animal heat.<eos>: 55.63048763467423
A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat.<eos>: 33.07545465940152
Near the
end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with
Athos, faithful after death.<eos>: 78.98899951075447
A dog’s spittle as you probably...<eos>: 30.817378585266994

winces.)_ Ah!

THE FAN: _(Tapping.)_ All things end.<eos>: 21.51102979784506
Be mine.<eos>: 13.521860221797589
Now.

BLOOM: _(Undecided.)_ All now?<eos>: 7.313704437870699
I should not have parted with my
talisman.<eos>: 31.67238062205307
Rain, exposure at dewfall on the searocks, a peccadillo at my
time of life.<eos>: 32.30504752933899
Every phenomenon has a natural cause.

THE FAN: _(Points downwards slowly.)_ You may.

BLOOM: _(Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace.)_ We
are observed.

THE FAN: _(Points downwards quickly.)_ You must.

BLOOM: _(With desire, with reluctance.)_ I can make a true black knot.
Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for
Kellett’s.<eos>: 27.43968329538986
Experienced hand.<eos>: 12.658689627251539

In
courtesy.<eos>: 3.426379526525185
I knelt once before today.<eos>: 62.95807303173391
Ah!

_(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the
edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked.
Bloom, stifflegged, aging, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers
draws out and in her laces.)_

BLOOM: _(Murmurs lovingly.)_ To be a shoefitter in Manfield’s was my
love’s young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up
crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so
incredibly impossibly small, of Clyde Road ladies.<eos>: 45.00503042045745
Even their wax model
Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb
toe, as worn in Paris.

THE HOOF: Smell my hot goathide.<eos>: 131.79903470685775
Feel my royal weight.

BLOOM: _(Crosslacing.)_ Too tight?

THE HOOF: If you bungle, Handy Andy, I’ll kick your football for you.

BLOOM: Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar
dance.<eos>: 35.87710727510686
Bad luck.<eos>: 13.588409230554301

That night she met...<eos>: 112.87669671124443
Now!

_(He knots the lace.<eos>: 16.421924721819153
Bella places her foot on the floor.<eos>: 35.052726535337754
Bloom raises
his head.<eos>: 23.89162824539281
Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in midbrow.<eos>: 38.71546728715546
His eyes grow
dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)_

BLOOM: _(Mumbles.)_ Awaiting your further orders we remain,
gentlemen,...

BELLO: _(With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.)_ Hound of
dishonour!

BLOOM: _(Infatuated.)_ Empress!

BELLO: _(His heavy cheekchops sagging.)_ Adorer of the adulterous rump!

BLOOM: _(Plaintively.)_ Hugeness!

BELLO: Dungdevourer!

BLOOM: _(With sinews semiflexed.)_ Magmagnificence!

BELLO: Down!<eos>: 13.458763489228497
_(He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.)_ Incline feet
forward!<eos>: 30.578303102974875
Slide left foot one pace back!<eos>: 152.5424248834159
You will fall.<eos>: 18.407122012843274
You are falling.
On the hands down!

BLOOM: _(Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing, yaps.)_
Truffles!

_(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting,
snuffling, rooting at his feet: then lies, shamming dead, with eyes
shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of
most excellent master.)_

BELLO: _(With bobbed hair, purple gills, fat moustache rings round his
shaven mouth, in mountaineer’s puttees, green silverbuttoned coat,
sport skirt and alpine hat with moorcock’s feather, his hands stuck
deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it
in.)_ Footstool!<eos>: 47.46871997803819
Feel my entire weight.<eos>: 49.7882126924657
Bow, bondslave, before the
throne of your despot’s glorious heels so glistening in their proud
erectness.

BLOOM: _(Enthralled, bleats.)_ I promise never to disobey.

BELLO: _(Laughs loudly.)_ Holy smoke!<eos>: 23.856231909973804
You little know what’s in store
for you.<eos>: 29.90160044591715
I’m the Tartar to settle your little lot and break you in!
I’ll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son.
Cheek me, I dare you.<eos>: 76.15823154077474
If you do tremble in anticipation of heel
discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.

_(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.)_

ZOE: _(Widening her slip to screen her.)_ She’s not here.

BLOOM: _(Closing her eyes.)_ She’s not here.

FLORRY: _(Hiding her with her gown.)_ She didn’t mean it, Mr Bello.
She’ll be good, sir.

KITTY: Don’t be too hard on her, Mr Bello.<eos>: 23.598027996185504
Sure you won’t, ma’amsir.

BELLO: _(Coaxingly.)_ Come, ducky dear, I want a word with you,
darling, just to administer correction.<eos>: 22.925263140235565
Just a little heart to heart
talk, sweety.<eos>: 71.8758307444471
_(Bloom puts out her timid head.)_ There’s a good girly
now.<eos>: 18.018328149004518
_(Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.)_ I only
want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot.<eos>: 62.32819526746827
How’s that
tender behind?<eos>: 33.061568704701
O, ever so gently, pet.<eos>: 66.97673225302339
Begin to get ready.

BLOOM: _(Fainting.)_ Don’t tear my...

BELLO: _(Savagely.)_ The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the
hanging hook, the knout I’ll make you kiss while the flutes play like
the Nubian slave of old.<eos>: 18.96876653215736
You’re in for it this time!<eos>: 30.58842900707067
I’ll make you
remember me for the balance of your natural life.<eos>: 20.107826917129668
_(His forehead veins
swollen, his face congested.)_ I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback
every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson’s fat
hamrashers and a bottle of Guinness’s porter.<eos>: 48.46267462991547
_(He belches.)_ And suck
my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the _Licensed
Victualler’s Gazette_.<eos>: 42.79779194686704
Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and
skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice of you with crisp crackling
from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and
lemon or currant sauce.<eos>: 111.16340823726547
It will hurt you.<eos>: 17.966252326211297
_(He twists her arm.<eos>: 10.059506239470222
Bloom
squeals, turning turtle.)_

BLOOM: Don’t be cruel, nurse!<eos>: 20.068627731786755
Don’t!

BELLO: _(Twisting.)_ Another!

BLOOM: _(Screams.)_ O, it’s hell itself!<eos>: 12.286109539757689
Every nerve in my body aches
like mad!

BELLO: _(Shouts.)_ Good, by the rumping jumping general!<eos>: 57.337241292470644
That’s the
best bit of news I heard these six weeks.<eos>: 66.20228699202386
Here, don’t keep me waiting,
damn you!<eos>: 26.747717402000333
_(He slaps her face.)_

BLOOM: _(Whimpers.)_ You’re after hitting me.<eos>: 7.532498552390681
I’ll tell...

BELLO: Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.

ZOE: Yes.<eos>: 24.29059469339786
Walk on him!<eos>: 14.372222024015825
I will.

FLORRY: I will.<eos>: 21.46745958417217
Don’t be greedy.

KITTY: No, me.<eos>: 11.52425363560351
Lend him to me.

_(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib,
men’s grey and green socks and brogues, floursmeared, a rollingpin
stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the
door.)_

MRS KEOGH: _(Ferociously.)_ Can I help?<eos>: 40.44884798408228
_(They hold and pinion Bloom.)_

BELLO: _(Squats with a grunt on Bloom’s upturned face, puffing
cigarsmoke, nursing a fat leg.)_ I see Keating Clay is elected
vicechairman of the Richmond asylum and by the by Guinness’s preference
shares are at sixteen three quarters.<eos>: 32.129511636216954
Curse me for a fool that didn’t
buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about.<eos>: 39.05363874961642
Just my infernal luck,
curse it.<eos>: 51.37306669146354
And that Goddamned outsider _Throwaway_ at twenty to one.
_(He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom’s ear.)_ Where’s that
Goddamned cursed ashtray?

BLOOM: _(Goaded, buttocksmothered.)_ O!<eos>: 20.819672618022572
O!<eos>: 5.45621285287314
Monsters!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
Cruel one!

BELLO: Ask for that every ten minutes.<eos>: 70.65874949966188
Beg.<eos>: 3.947817542674181
Pray for it as you never
prayed before.<eos>: 49.669611842502384
_(He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.)_ Here,
kiss that.<eos>: 39.35261187807158
Both.<eos>: 5.514547898235115
Kiss.<eos>: 2.4607144623559307
_(He throws a leg astride and, pressing with
horseman’s knees, calls in a hard voice.)_ Gee up!<eos>: 24.15076788214774
A cockhorse to
Banbury cross.<eos>: 14.766183869739434
I’ll ride him for the Eclipse stakes.<eos>: 8.815232228951508
_(He bends
sideways and squeezes his mount’s testicles roughly, shouting.)_ Ho!
Off we pop!<eos>: 49.76527836080339
I’ll nurse you in proper fashion.<eos>: 39.082158389566985
_(He horserides
cockhorse, leaping in the, in the saddle.)_ The lady goes a pace a pace
and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a
gallop a gallop a gallop.

FLORRY: _(Pulls at Bello.)_ Let me on him now.<eos>: 39.62306743998055
You had enough.<eos>: 18.971456538119316
I asked
before you.

ZOE: _(Pulling at Florry.)_ Me.<eos>: 21.827247049641567
Me.<eos>: 2.19598765502665
Are you not finished with him yet,
suckeress?

BLOOM: _(Stifling.)_ Can’t.

BELLO: Well, I’m not.<eos>: 15.430588376907595
Wait.<eos>: 2.366011761982759
_(He holds in his breath.)_ Curse it.<eos>: 18.084341515535403
Here.
This bung’s about burst.<eos>: 34.39762571733308
_(He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting
his features, farts loudly.)_ Take that!<eos>: 25.361309836723304
_(He recorks himself.)_ Yes,
by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.

BLOOM: _(A sweat breaking out over him.)_ Not man.<eos>: 26.49877364926205
_(He sniffs.)_
Woman.

BELLO: _(Stands up.)_ No more blow hot and cold.<eos>: 25.779014344453923
What you longed for
has come to pass.<eos>: 63.57689379229196
Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a
thing under the yoke.<eos>: 60.79878189341757
Now for your punishment frock.<eos>: 34.89810287887024
You will shed your
male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen?<eos>: 102.17580250283793
and don the shot silk
luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders.<eos>: 158.57018802665633
And quickly too!

BLOOM: _(Shrinks.)_ Silk, mistress said!<eos>: 28.786508245414666
O crinkly!<eos>: 7.200767034583973
scrapy!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
Must I
tiptouch it with my nails?

BELLO: _(Points to his whores.)_ As they are now so will you be,
wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven
armpits.<eos>: 21.72446098828827
Tape measurements will be taken next your skin.<eos>: 68.06652232863102
You will be
laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille with
whalebone busk to the diamondtrimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge,
while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in
nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things
stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for
Alice and nice scent for Alice.<eos>: 75.46628258634397
Alice will feel the pullpull.<eos>: 15.63095759840821
Martha
and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing
but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind
you...

BLOOM: _(A charming soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and large
male hands and nose, leering mouth.)_ I tried her things on only twice,
a small prank, in Holles street.<eos>: 62.14640638649358
When we were hard up I washed them to
save the laundry bill.<eos>: 49.47863748871479
My own shirts I turned.<eos>: 54.08756267904224
It was the purest
thrift.

BELLO: _(Jeers.)_ Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh?<eos>: 24.27054382400035
And showed
off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind closedrawn blinds
your unskirted thighs and hegoat’s udders in various poses of
surrender, eh?<eos>: 49.34829160659947
Ho!<eos>: 7.014603794331746
ho!<eos>: 7.014603794331746
I have to laugh!<eos>: 24.968580806702445
That secondhand black operatop
shift and short trunkleg naughties all split up the stitches at her
last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne hotel,
eh?

BLOOM: Miriam.<eos>: 75.70094451454618
Black.<eos>: 5.9762236268207065
Demimondaine.

BELLO: _(Guffaws.)_ Christ Almighty it’s too tickling, this!<eos>: 21.1760680880414
You were a
nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay
swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade about to be
violated by lieutenant Smythe-Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell M.
P., signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy,
Henri Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Croesus,
the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid
Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton.<eos>: 35.31358225284973
_(He guffaws
again.)_ Christ, wouldn’t it make a Siamese cat laugh?

BLOOM: _(Her hands and features working.)_ It was Gerald converted me
to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High
School play _Vice Versa_.<eos>: 32.63831902807992
It was dear Gerald.<eos>: 39.70491263878671
He got that kink,
fascinated by sister’s stays.<eos>: 26.772293477961853
Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint
and gilds his eyelids.<eos>: 28.431245134719088
Cult of the beautiful.

BELLO: _(With wicked glee.)_ Beautiful!<eos>: 22.69698509668989
Give us a breather!<eos>: 12.011488495216737
When you
took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on
the smoothworn throne.

BLOOM: Science.<eos>: 43.9057357750953
To compare the various joys we each enjoy.
_(Earnestly.)_ And really it’s better the position...<eos>: 90.55151902947955
because often I
used to wet...

BELLO: _(Sternly.)_ No insubordination!<eos>: 27.053962138276507
The sawdust is there in the
corner for you.<eos>: 32.87522967789016
I gave you strict instructions, didn’t I?<eos>: 21.69394268509433
Do it
standing, sir!<eos>: 60.17847308147724
I’ll teach you to behave like a jinkleman!<eos>: 12.481014193667836
If I catch a
trace on your swaddles.<eos>: 27.095850241256027
Aha!<eos>: 5.101071619298531
By the ass of the Dorans you’ll find I’m a
martinet.<eos>: 18.507749821813434
The sins of your past are rising against you.<eos>: 90.5412096454612
Many.<eos>: 8.779683594492345
Hundreds.

THE SINS OF THE PAST: _(In a medley of voices.)_ He went through a form
of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the
Black church.<eos>: 40.25206939085799
Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn
at an address in D’Olier street while he presented himself indecently
to the instrument in the callbox.<eos>: 34.32785214168122
By word and deed he frankly
encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an
unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises.<eos>: 70.31717424815876
In five public
conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner
to all strongmembered males.<eos>: 52.409297430894
And by the offensively smelling vitriol
works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to
see if and what and how much he could see?<eos>: 128.8337977646752
Did he not lie in bed, the
gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper
presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a
postal order?

BELLO: _(Whistles loudly.)_ Say!<eos>: 27.682758998238498
What was the most revolting piece of
obscenity in all your career of crime?<eos>: 43.152218123393695
Go the whole hog.<eos>: 29.404712028050593
Puke it out!
Be candid for once.

_(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering,
Booloohoom.<eos>: 22.561501825130428
Poldy Kock, Bootlaces a penny, Cassidy’s hag, blind
stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other,
the...)_

BLOOM: Don’t ask me!<eos>: 38.56591509510148
Our mutual faith.<eos>: 42.62729654375682
Pleasants street.<eos>: 7.866519319496127
I only thought
the half of the...<eos>: 50.24681987381571
I swear on my sacred oath...

BELLO: _(Peremptorily.)_ Answer.<eos>: 22.91469694393305
Repugnant wretch!<eos>: 38.62561907423235
I insist on knowing.
Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good ghoststory or a
line of poetry, quick, quick, quick!<eos>: 73.49166683554272
Where?<eos>: 4.213136859000814
How?<eos>: 4.022285018086728
What time?<eos>: 10.820862514232541
With how
many?<eos>: 32.43304649165454
I give you just three seconds.<eos>: 30.744455369944777
One!<eos>: 11.716046929045035
Two!<eos>: 16.268462852106232
Thr...

BLOOM: _(Docile, gurgles.)_ I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...

BELLO: _(Imperiously.)_ O, get out, you skunk!<eos>: 8.61326790942814
Hold your tongue!<eos>: 21.836612378126052
Speak
when you’re spoken to.

BLOOM: _(Bows.)_ Master!<eos>: 18.706000087593615
Mistress!<eos>: 7.370293317621559
Mantamer!

_(He lifts his arms.<eos>: 13.751362431358123
His bangle bracelets fall.)_

BELLO: _(Satirically.)_ By day you will souse and bat our smelling
underclothes also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines
with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail.<eos>: 83.5352998963821
Won’t that be
nice?<eos>: 21.759568627528147
_(He places a ruby ring on her finger.)_ And there now!<eos>: 32.32279980936768
With this
ring I thee own.<eos>: 239.8927065199532
Say, thank you, mistress.

BLOOM: Thank you, mistress.

BELLO: You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in
the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh’s the cook’s, a sandy one.
Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like
champagne.<eos>: 69.86470840876812
Drink me piping hot.<eos>: 33.138298419948526
Hop!<eos>: 8.464027779313264
You will dance attendance or I’ll
lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right
well, miss, with the hairbrush.<eos>: 61.470996077795355
You’ll be taught the error of your
ways.<eos>: 23.265287064481175
At night your wellcreamed braceletted hands will wear
fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately
scented fingertips.<eos>: 84.26689805694211
For such favours knights of old laid down their
lives.<eos>: 92.78123313290345
_(He chuckles.)_ My boys will be no end charmed to see you so
ladylike, the colonel, above all, when they come here the night before
the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels.<eos>: 67.71728170653327
First I’ll
have a go at you myself.<eos>: 25.508013843674878
A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta
Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the
Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work
at a short knock.<eos>: 82.52330940134321
Swell the bust.<eos>: 21.850932187590974
Smile.<eos>: 3.7358170162768913
Droop shoulders.<eos>: 12.901830139360294
What offers?
_(He points.)_ For that lot.<eos>: 28.951461351785518
Trained by owner to fetch and carry,
basket in mouth.<eos>: 78.89208238021548
_(He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom’s
vulva.)_ There’s fine depth for you!<eos>: 15.77439218461166
What, boys?<eos>: 17.55096055205772
That give you a
hardon?<eos>: 12.085213304855284
_(He shoves his arm in a bidder’s face.)_ Here wet the deck and
wipe it round!

A BIDDER: A florin.

_(Dillon’s lacquey rings his handbell.)_

THE LACQUEY: Barang!

A VOICE: One and eightpence too much.

CHARLES ALBERTA MARSH: Must be virgin.<eos>: 29.82705879751612
Good breath.<eos>: 13.279766264026739
Clean.

BELLO: _(Gives a rap with his gavel.)_ Two bar.<eos>: 17.067074563314616
Rockbottom figure and
cheap at the price.<eos>: 62.32691201987315
Fourteen hands high.<eos>: 37.18512491657233
Touch and examine shis points.
Handle hrim.<eos>: 24.084831888482565
This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh.<eos>: 113.20711266084069
If
I had only my gold piercer here!<eos>: 58.8520408615637
And quite easy to milk.<eos>: 56.97291459871127
Three newlaid
gallons a day.<eos>: 40.60288119909118
A pure stockgetter, due to lay within the hour.<eos>: 57.3876774806546
His
sire’s milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks.
Whoa, my jewel!<eos>: 73.3603454053055
Beg up!<eos>: 16.33991083266279
Whoa!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
_(He brands his initial C on Bloom’s
croup.)_ So!<eos>: 21.921381425501075
Warranted Cohen!<eos>: 31.004809919738214
What advance on two bob, gentlemen?

A DARKVISAGED MAN: _(In disguised accent.)_ Hoondert punt sterlink.

VOICES: _(Subdued.)_ For the Caliph.<eos>: 16.068137962292422
Haroun Al Raschid.

BELLO: _(Gaily.)_ Right.<eos>: 9.47030481893305
Let them all come.<eos>: 38.028469212277955
The scanty, daringly short
skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a
potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long
straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better
instincts of the _blasé_ man about town.<eos>: 87.35228937504125
Learn the smooth mincing walk
on four inch Louis Quinze heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup,
the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing.<eos>: 88.82006292907329
Bring all your powers of
fascination to bear on them.<eos>: 37.966038905708444
Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.

BLOOM: _(Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with
forefinger in mouth.)_ O, I know what you’re hinting at now!

BELLO: What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you?<eos>: 33.80365212394758
_(He
stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suet folds
of Bloom’s haunches.)_ Up!<eos>: 27.647156253264153
Up!<eos>: 9.193528562648314
Manx cat!<eos>: 24.055600234200277
What have we here?<eos>: 21.862860198908578
Where’s
your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly?<eos>: 61.8319121925033
Sing,
birdy, sing.<eos>: 20.906827472733543
It’s as limp as a boy of six’s doing his pooly behind a
cart.<eos>: 59.4702823960782
Buy a bucket or sell your pump.<eos>: 70.56762372300291
_(Loudly.)_ Can you do a man’s
job?

BLOOM: Eccles street...

BELLO: _(Sarcastically.)_ I wouldn’t hurt your feelings for the world
but there’s a man of brawn in possession there.<eos>: 23.20054348892522
The tables are turned,
my gay young fellow!<eos>: 154.84681526674902
He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man.<eos>: 20.022649429581037
Well
for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and
warts all over it.<eos>: 45.867141196742395
He shot his bolt, I can tell you!<eos>: 52.57593079799122
Foot to foot, knee
to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast!<eos>: 117.30150895332514
He’s no eunuch.<eos>: 18.3354691072825
A shock of red
hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush!<eos>: 69.57889305387096
Wait for nine
months, my lad!<eos>: 74.04808109481488
Holy ginger, it’s kicking and coughing up and down in
her guts already!<eos>: 99.24018020614704
That makes you wild, don’t it?<eos>: 34.95443258294335
Touches the spot?<eos>: 23.114766348513694
_(He
spits in contempt.)_ Spittoon!

BLOOM: I was indecently treated, I...<eos>: 12.8536442684021
Inform the police.<eos>: 15.593575122059551
Hundred
pounds.<eos>: 23.31448109296756
Unmentionable.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
I...

BELLO: Would if you could, lame duck.<eos>: 70.65545287376554
A downpour we want not your
drizzle.

BLOOM: To drive me mad!<eos>: 56.23374518055812
Moll!<eos>: 6.823314196580793
I forgot!<eos>: 18.02250136830871
Forgive!<eos>: 11.413272606912217
Moll...<eos>: 8.81655156789773
We...<eos>: 11.01195752528782
Still...

BELLO: _(Ruthlessly.)_ No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman’s
will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty
years.<eos>: 60.5975849812526
Return and see.

_(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)_

SLEEPY HOLLOW: Rip van Wink!<eos>: 74.75483075553632
Rip van Winkle!

BLOOM: _(In tattered mocassins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tiptoeing,
fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the
diamond panes, cries out.)_ I see her!<eos>: 36.16977850603859
It’s she!<eos>: 24.231018149327657
The first night at Mat
Dillon’s!<eos>: 31.06799481158858
But that dress, the green!<eos>: 51.791135960437416
And her hair is dyed gold and
he...

BELLO: _(Laughs mockingly.)_ That’s your daughter, you owl, with a
Mullingar student.

_(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her blue scarf
in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and
calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)_

MILLY: My!<eos>: 41.943266302389205
It’s Papli!<eos>: 13.551300299690524
But, O Papli, how old you’ve grown!

BELLO: Changed, eh?<eos>: 75.3090612025177
Our whatnot, our writingtable where we never wrote,
aunt Hegarty’s armchair, our classic reprints of old masters.<eos>: 31.035309409223427
A man and
his menfriends are living there in clover.<eos>: 26.071007824529147
The _Cuckoos’ Rest!_ Why
not?<eos>: 39.15009463442742
How many women had you, eh, following them up dark streets,
flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts, what, you male
prostitute?<eos>: 82.71781107935081
Blameless dames with parcels of groceries.<eos>: 37.994848161143416
Turn about.
Sauce for the goose, my gander O.

BLOOM: They...<eos>: 69.72474700459455
I...

BELLO: _(Cuttingly.)_ Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet
you bought at Wren’s auction.<eos>: 29.779071471458384
In their horseplay with Moll the romp to
find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue
you carried home in the rain for art for art’s sake.<eos>: 77.57197049228276
They will violate
the secrets of your bottom drawer.<eos>: 28.740501161081795
Pages will be torn from your
handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills.<eos>: 35.98663620260719
And they will spit in
your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom’s.

BLOOM: Ten and six.<eos>: 59.8482366013099
The act of low scoundrels.<eos>: 24.085425482594825
Let me go.<eos>: 12.858058281129576
I will
return.<eos>: 26.40717792401616
I will prove...

A VOICE: Swear!

_(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowieknife between his
teeth.)_

BELLO: As a paying guest or a kept man?<eos>: 43.062616944086024
Too late.<eos>: 18.370989097073984
You have made your
secondbest bed and others must lie in it.<eos>: 46.5073265954304
Your epitaph is written.<eos>: 12.464448037270689
You
are down and out and don’t you forget it, old bean.

BLOOM: Justice!<eos>: 28.61653496875172
All Ireland versus one!<eos>: 75.05182629313447
Has nobody...?<eos>: 57.127430219750146
_(He bites his
thumb.)_

BELLO: Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or
grace about you.<eos>: 34.630424620489926
I can give you a rare old wine that’ll send you
skipping to hell and back.<eos>: 48.50157305109064
Sign a will and leave us any coin you have!
If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it!<eos>: 112.96103706777143
We’ll bury
you in our shrubbery jakes where you’ll be dead and dirty with old Cuck
Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and
sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands,
whatever the buggers’ names were, suffocated in the one cesspool.<eos>: 41.74192258851669
_(He
explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.)_ We’ll manure you, Mr Flower!<eos>: 18.449667130012266
_(He
pipes scoffingly.)_ Byby, Poldy!<eos>: 19.064022899842954
Byby, Papli!

BLOOM: _(Clasps his head.)_ My willpower!<eos>: 10.65311758550063
Memory!<eos>: 5.413330642558909
I have sinned!<eos>: 24.3527617909989
I have
suff...

_(He weeps tearlessly.)_

BELLO: _(Sneers.)_ Crybabby!<eos>: 5.266894300321042
Crocodile tears!

_(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to
the earth.<eos>: 32.787303606709486

recreant Bloom.)_

THE CIRCUMCISED: _(In dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit
upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad._

VOICES: _(Sighing.)_ So he’s gone.<eos>: 45.765295083786086
Ah yes.<eos>: 5.3365465287182134
Yes, indeed.<eos>: 8.677605449392791
Bloom?<eos>: 6.193764571747198
Never
heard of him.<eos>: 15.987279986494755
No?<eos>: 7.6288815975081885
Queer kind of chap.<eos>: 42.74425828623056
There’s the widow.<eos>: 12.659791700754653
That so?<eos>: 13.326885882807474
Ah,
yes.

_(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends.<eos>: 9.872475203584596
The pall of
incense smoke screens and disperses.<eos>: 22.613462460397237
Out of her oakframe a nymph with
hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown artcolours, descends from her
grotto and passing under interlacing yews stands over Bloom.)_

THE YEWS: _(Their leaves whispering.)_ Sister.<eos>: 34.71345362963739
Our sister.<eos>: 13.433598893055633
Ssh!

THE NYMPH: _(Softly.)_ Mortal!<eos>: 10.23756067812314
_(Kindly.)_ Nay, dost not weepest!

BLOOM: _(Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight,
with dignity.)_ This position.<eos>: 23.05365515702082
I felt it was expected of me.<eos>: 26.353205408166616
Force of
habit.

THE NYMPH: Mortal!<eos>: 35.33173338106904
You found me in evil company, highkickers, coster
picnicmakers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in
fleshtights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical
act, the hit of the century.<eos>: 22.496825016799527
I was hidden in cheap pink paper that
smelt of rock oil.<eos>: 125.63330873833672
I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen,
stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice
and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with
testimonial from ruptured gentleman.<eos>: 31.40870740851009
Useful hints to the married.

BLOOM: _(Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.)_ We have met before.<eos>: 27.519817660348206
On
another star.

THE NYMPH: _(Sadly.)_ Rubber goods.<eos>: 22.876316412490493
Neverrip brand as supplied to the
aristocracy.<eos>: 14.518075830908062
Corsets for men.<eos>: 13.886582420398533
I cure fits or money refunded.
Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann’s wonderful chest
exuber.<eos>: 60.96793676357286
My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus
Rublin with photo.

BLOOM: You mean _Photo Bits?_

THE NYMPH: I do.<eos>: 106.8613073087891
You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me
above your marriage couch.<eos>: 87.99381065497623
Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in
four places.<eos>: 56.17464369902963
And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my
shame.

BLOOM: _(Humbly kisses her long hair.)_ Your classic curves, beautiful
immortal, I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty,
almost to pray.

THE NYMPH: During dark nights I heard your praise.

BLOOM: _(Quickly.)_ Yes, yes.<eos>: 62.52639001487064
You mean that I...<eos>: 23.045815039454823
Sleep reveals the
worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted.<eos>: 65.61339955301453
I know I fell out of
bed or rather was pushed.<eos>: 115.07119640270689
Steel wine is said to cure snoring.<eos>: 59.77323264404544
For the
rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some
days ago, incorrectly addressed.<eos>: 82.0788508885077
It claims to afford a noiseless,
inoffensive vent.<eos>: 13.34332832931489
_(He sighs.)_ ’Twas ever thus.<eos>: 28.827674726096184
Frailty, thy name is
marriage.

THE NYMPH: _(Her fingers in her ears.)_ And words.<eos>: 27.725893388895543
They are not in my
dictionary.

BLOOM: You understood them?

THE YEWS: Ssh!

THE NYMPH: _(Covers her face with her hands.)_ What have I not seen in
that chamber?<eos>: 23.47327474501224
What must my eyes look down on?

BLOOM: _(Apologetically.)_ I know.<eos>: 19.621326968408486
Soiled personal linen, wrong side up
with care.<eos>: 191.0331796291818
The quoits are loose.<eos>: 99.98866626032486
From Gibraltar by long sea long ago.

THE NYMPH: _(Bends her head.)_ Worse, worse!

BLOOM: _(Reflects precautiously.)_ That antiquated commode.<eos>: 27.479308964390228
It wasn’t
her weight.<eos>: 24.120297407633064
She scaled just eleven stone nine.<eos>: 116.5656485122131
She put on nine pounds
after weaning.<eos>: 48.075517916328884
It was a crack and want of glue.<eos>: 27.940728981476205
Eh?<eos>: 8.027425029092774
And that absurd
orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.

_(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)_

THE WATERFALL:

     Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
     Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.

THE YEWS: _(Mingling their boughs.)_ Listen.<eos>: 35.506849527319275
Whisper.<eos>: 1.808650224977277
She is right, our
sister.<eos>: 28.899776873950582
We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall.<eos>: 162.52288357721451
We gave shade on languorous
summer days.

JOHN WYSE NOLAN: _(In the background, in Irish National Forester’s
uniform, doffs his plumed hat.)_ Prosper!<eos>: 19.52418097921461
Give shade on languorous
days, trees of Ireland!

THE YEWS: _(Murmuring.)_ Who came to Poulaphouca with the High School
excursion?<eos>: 36.404221106053726
Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?

BLOOM: _(Scared.)_ High School of Poula?<eos>: 28.52522962685913
Mnemo?<eos>: 5.454663312069258
Not in full possession
of faculties.<eos>: 19.50695801696001
Concussion.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Run over by tram.

THE ECHO: Sham!

BLOOM: _(Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript
juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis
shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops and a red schoolcap with
badge.)_ I was in my teens, a growing boy.<eos>: 40.337012602041305
A little then sufficed, a
jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies’ cloakroom and lavatory,
the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs (for they love crushes,
instinct of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice),
even a pricelist of their hosiery.<eos>: 34.67458429630419
And then the heat.<eos>: 43.57922553034174
There were
sunspots that summer.<eos>: 32.33839683216453
End of school.<eos>: 14.378967164483099
And tipsycake.<eos>: 3.4582318607912326
Halcyon days.

_(Halcyon days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and
shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen
Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a
clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)_

THE HALCYON DAYS: Mackerel!<eos>: 50.93497707714546
Live us again.<eos>: 31.39041795099611
Hurray!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
_(They cheer.)_

BLOOM: _(Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, starred with spent
snowballs, struggles to rise.)_ Again!<eos>: 10.97035482400176
I feel sixteen!<eos>: 59.194219782592945
What a lark!
Let’s ring all the bells in Montague street.<eos>: 42.93236631886722
_(He cheers feebly.)_
Hurray for the High School!

THE ECHO: Fool!

THE YEWS: _(Rustling.)_ She is right, our sister.<eos>: 24.630761059853985
Whisper.<eos>: 1.808650224977277
_(Whispered
kisses are heard in all the wood.<eos>: 86.4768214672269
Faces of hamadryads peep out from the
boles and among the leaves and break, blossoming into bloom.)_ Who
profaned our silent shade?

THE NYMPH: _(Coyly, through parting fingers.)_ There?<eos>: 44.77377655791966
In the open air?

THE YEWS: _(Sweeping downward.)_ Sister, yes.<eos>: 18.363546647421906
And on our virgin sward.

THE WATERFALL:

     Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
     Phoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.

THE NYMPH: _(With wide fingers.)_ O, infamy!

BLOOM: I was precocious.<eos>: 20.758193330676868
Youth.<eos>: 2.3607744348689743
The fauna.<eos>: 3.394604471055354
I sacrificed to the god of
the forest.<eos>: 15.506329535378937
The flowers that bloom in the spring.<eos>: 46.96712487159517
It was pairing time.
Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon.<eos>: 32.145904292006186
Lotty Clarke,
flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through illclosed curtains
with poor papa’s operaglasses: The wanton ate grass wildly.<eos>: 48.84895544267606
She rolled
downhill at Rialto bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits.
She climbed their crooked tree and I...<eos>: 127.81960891964692
A saint couldn’t resist it.<eos>: 25.433959161732307
The
demon possessed me.<eos>: 15.760978440293245
Besides, who saw?

_(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf, thrusts a ruminating head with
humid nostrils through the foliage.)_

STAGGERING BOB: (_Large teardrops rolling from his prominent eyes,
snivels._) Me.<eos>: 35.99616418410864
Me see.

BLOOM: Simply satisfying a need I...<eos>: 60.67400549754651
_(With pathos.)_ No girl would
when I went girling.<eos>: 36.05403759497852
Too ugly.<eos>: 21.44055564547132
They wouldn’t play...

_(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes,
plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping currants.)_

THE NANNYGOAT: _(Bleats.)_ Megeggaggegg!<eos>: 18.26401430102355
Nannannanny!

BLOOM: _(Hatless, flushed, covered with burrs of thistledown and
gorsespine.)_ Regularly engaged.<eos>: 13.779840033408858

of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls roteatingly from the Lion’s Head
cliff into the purple waiting waters.)_

THE DUMMYMUMMY: Bbbbblllllblblblblobschbg!

_(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the_ Erin’s King
_sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards
the land.)_

COUNCILLOR NANNETTI: _(Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellowkitefaced,
his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.)_ When my country takes
her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then, let
my epitaph be written.<eos>: 47.694023151907274
I have...

BLOOM: Done.<eos>: 25.009436464121965
Prff!

THE NYMPH: _(Loftily.)_ We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a
place and no hair there either.<eos>: 34.59053270734838
We are stonecold and pure.<eos>: 21.52363733421446
We eat

_(She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing
her forefinger in her mouth.)_ Spoke to me.<eos>: 33.05228160606624
Heard from behind.<eos>: 32.141048162226646
How then
could you...?

BLOOM: _(Pawing the heather abjectly.)_ O, I have been a perfect pig.
Enemas too I have administered.<eos>: 18.259321176714437
One third of a pint of quassia to which
add a tablespoonful of rocksalt.<eos>: 24.253721445668166

knee.)_ And the rest!

BLOOM: _(Dejected.)_ Yes.<eos>: 16.18806223393673
_Peccavi!_ I have paid homage on that living
altar where the back changes name.<eos>: 144.96641582977665
_(With sudden fervour.)_ For why
should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules...?

_(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the
treestems, cooeeing.)_

THE VOICE OF KITTY: _(In the thicket.)_ Show us one of them cushions.

THE VOICE OF FLORRY: Here.

_(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)_

THE VOICE OF LYNCH: _(In the thicket.)_ Whew!<eos>: 26.679564366253224
Piping hot!

panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over
beechmast and acorns.)_ Hot!<eos>: 22.2837522000872
Hot!<eos>: 15.639633658330059

BLOOM: It overpowers me.<eos>: 42.477253941108444
The warm impress of her warm form.<eos>: 36.9173948224922
Even to sit
where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to
grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted
white sateen coatpans.<eos>: 132.28398887000455
So womanly, full.<eos>: 82.90804974498188
It fills me full.

THE YEWS: Ssh!<eos>: 30.799642534257533

softly, with remote eyes.)_ Tranquilla convent.<eos>: 19.58463622535224

_(She
reclines her head, sighing.)_ Only the ethereal.<eos>: 15.582337543400387
Where dreamy creamy
gull waves o’er the waters dull.

_(Bloom half rises.<eos>: 75.49691624087876
His back trouserbutton snaps.)_

THE BUTTON: Bip!

_(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)_

THE SLUTS:

     O, Leopold lost the pin of his drawers
     He didn’t know what to do,
     To keep it up,
     To keep it up.

BLOOM: _(Coldly.)_ You have broken the spell.<eos>: 26.217872775870315
The last straw.<eos>: 28.730601212599563
If there
were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices?<eos>: 39.84935375072195
Shy
but willing like an ass pissing.

THE YEWS: _(Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms
aging and swaying.)_ Deciduously!

THE NYMPH: _(Her features hardening, gropes in the folds of her
habit.)_ Sacrilege!<eos>: 20.95707736139892
To attempt my virtue!<eos>: 89.08770387985291
_(A large moist stain appears
on her robe.)_ Sully my innocence!<eos>: 39.4026849232744
You are not fit to touch the garment
of a pure woman.<eos>: 41.92100369973549
_(She clutches again in her robe.)_ Wait.<eos>: 18.784296945946807

_(She draws a
poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine,
strikes at his loins.)_ Nekum!

BLOOM: _(Starts up, seizes her hand.)_ Hoy!<eos>: 18.150038826837772

What do you lack with your barbed wire?<eos>: 27.108783971593823
Crucifix not thick enough?
_(He clutches her veil.)_ A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame
gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier, or good mother
Alphonsus, eh Reynard?

THE NYMPH: _(With a cry flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast
cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.)_ Poli...!

BLOOM: _(Calls after her.)_ As if you didn’t get it on the double
yourselves.<eos>: 29.970633383468883
No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you.<eos>: 34.00137765086028
I tried it.
Your strength our weakness.<eos>: 69.8403524414773
What’s our studfee?<eos>: 7.076232785182114
What will you pay on
the nail?<eos>: 27.433777114351543
You fee mendancers on the Riviera, I read.<eos>: 20.042461654394376
_(The fleeing
nymph raises a keen.)_ Eh?<eos>: 29.63959763954507
I have sixteen years of black slave labour
behind me.<eos>: 78.84299443401541
And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow,

_(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)_

BELLA: You’ll know me the next time.

BLOOM: _(Composed, regards her.) Passée._ Mutton dressed as lamb.<eos>: 32.08715348636537
Long
in the tooth and superfluous hair.<eos>: 15.076283767259252
A raw onion the last thing at night
would benefit your complexion.<eos>: 70.45791714408715
And take some double chin drill.<eos>: 65.14535214750653
Your
eyes are as vapid as the glasseyes of your stuffed fox.<eos>: 48.56159061211188
They have the
dimensions of your other features, that’s all.<eos>: 28.375025377660318
I’m not a triple screw
propeller.

BELLA: _(Contemptuously.)_ You’re not game, in fact.<eos>: 11.377135024185295
_(Her sowcunt
barks.)_ Fbhracht!

BLOOM: _(Contemptuously.)_ Clean your nailless middle finger first,
your bully’s cold spunk is dripping from your cockscomb.<eos>: 28.85788252853738
Take a handful
of hay and wipe yourself.

BELLA: I know you, canvasser!<eos>: 42.60457669151816
Dead cod!

BLOOM: I saw him, kipkeeper!<eos>: 23.6554894388846
Pox and gleet vendor!

BELLA: _(Turns to the piano.)_ Which of you was playing the dead march
from _Saul?_

ZOE: Me.<eos>: 40.51928070332739
Mind your cornflowers.<eos>: 9.146498112815559
_(She darts to the piano and bangs
chords on it with crossed arms.)_ The cat’s ramble through the slag.
_(She glances back.)_ Eh?<eos>: 18.51598870868699
Who’s making love to my sweeties?<eos>: 22.033627917530225
_(She darts
back to the table.)_ What’s yours is mine and what’s mine is my own.

_(Kitty, disconcerted, coats her teeth with the silver paper.<eos>: 28.231849899039144
Bloom
approaches Zoe.)_

BLOOM: _(Gently.)_ Give me back that potato, will you?

ZOE: Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.

BLOOM: _(With feeling.)_ It is nothing, but still, a relic of poor
mamma.

ZOE:

     Give a thing and take it back
     God’ll ask you where is that
     You’ll say you don’t know
     God’ll send you down below.

BLOOM: There is a memory attached to it.<eos>: 40.772411514621
I should like to have it.

STEPHEN: To have or not to have that is the question.

ZOE: Here.<eos>: 45.69123261998533
_(She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh,
and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.)_ Those that hides
knows where to find.

BELLA: _(Frowns.)_ Here.<eos>: 36.97112426683635
This isn’t a musical peepshow.<eos>: 21.092683936537846
And don’t you
smash that piano.<eos>: 18.335328407441544
Who’s paying here?

_(She goes to the pianola.<eos>: 15.913664680217341
Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking
out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)_

STEPHEN: _(With exaggerated politeness.)_ This silken purse I made out
of the sow’s ear of the public.<eos>: 28.386392117988766
Madam, excuse me.<eos>: 14.984531787517811
If you allow me.<eos>: 10.94509539456809
_(He
indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.)_ We are all in the same sweepstake,
Kinch and Lynch.<eos>: 25.04584629041444
_Dans ce bordel où tenons nostre état_.

LYNCH: _(Calls from the hearth.)_ Dedalus!<eos>: 11.721649280263133
Give her your blessing for
me.

STEPHEN: _(Hands Bella a coin.)_ Gold.<eos>: 37.05719995570275
She has it.

BELLA: _(Looks at the money, then at Stephen, then at Zoe, Florry and
Kitty.)_ Do you want three girls?<eos>: 47.248827022078835
It’s ten shillings here.

STEPHEN: _(Delightedly.)_ A hundred thousand apologies.<eos>: 17.039984074137053
_(He fumbles
again and takes out and hands her two crowns.)_ Permit, _brevi manu_,
my sight is somewhat troubled.

_(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to
himself in monosyllables.<eos>: 41.509916236285484
Zoe bends over the table.<eos>: 34.46840176338079
Kitty leans over
Zoe’s neck.<eos>: 27.63878425892684
Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty’s waist,
adds his head to the group.)_

FLORRY: _(Strives heavily to rise.)_ Ow!<eos>: 29.43286148705788
My foot’s asleep.<eos>: 23.339316263763216
_(She limps
over to the table.<eos>: 14.596755030616805
Bloom approaches.)_

BELLA, ZOE, KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM: _(Chattering and squabbling.)_ The
gentleman...<eos>: 19.109335818667333
ten shillings...<eos>: 56.48437424661194
paying for the three...<eos>: 44.05649162219963

are you staying the night or a short
time?...<eos>: 38.3109793014731
who did?...<eos>: 27.15726082874915
you’re a liar, excuse me...<eos>: 22.35557305213939
the gentleman paid
down like a gentleman...<eos>: 114.49110853422413
drink...<eos>: 8.241904715602729
it’s long after eleven.

STEPHEN: _(At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.)_ No
bottles!<eos>: 28.505340025160685
What, eleven?<eos>: 21.301502676260185
A riddle!

ZOE: _(Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the
top of her stocking.)_ Hard earned on the flat of my back.

LYNCH: _(Lifting Kitty from the table.)_ Come!

KITTY: Wait.<eos>: 31.80284428664987
_(She clutches the two crowns.)_

FLORRY: And me?

LYNCH: Hoopla!

_(He lifts her, carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)_

STEPHEN:

     The fox crew, the cocks flew,
     The bells in heaven
     Were striking eleven.
     ’Tis time for her poor soul
     To get out of heaven.

BLOOM: _(Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and
Florry.)_ So.<eos>: 42.18800140016071
Allow me.<eos>: 4.228795542633381
_(He takes up the poundnote.)_ Three times ten.
We’re square.

BELLA: _(Admiringly.)_ You’re such a slyboots, old cocky.<eos>: 15.254727432722268
I could kiss
you.

ZOE: _(Points.)_ Him?<eos>: 16.400297069321073
Deep as a drawwell.<eos>: 12.359567792604643
_(Lynch bends Kitty back over
the sofa and kisses her.<eos>: 50.64495562046313
Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)_

BLOOM: This is yours.

STEPHEN: How is that?<eos>: 23.428468957415195
_Le distrait_ or absentminded beggar.<eos>: 30.568809305479363
_(He
fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins.<eos>: 20.30455376573395
An object
falls.)_ That fell.

BLOOM: _(Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.)_ This.

STEPHEN: Lucifer.<eos>: 35.14449881900374
Thanks.

BLOOM: _(Quietly.)_ You had better hand over that cash to me to take
care of.<eos>: 38.060693419826436
Why pay more?

STEPHEN: _(Hands him all his coins.)_ Be just before you are generous.

BLOOM: I will but is it wise?<eos>: 68.12746240178078
_(He counts.)_ One, seven, eleven, and
five.<eos>: 22.664732715558756
Six.<eos>: 10.919247846696173
Eleven.<eos>: 4.740407477538804
I don’t answer for what you may have lost.

STEPHEN: Why striking eleven?<eos>: 48.9222418375685
Proparoxyton.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Moment before the next
Lessing says.<eos>: 44.84993754650683
Thirsty fox.<eos>: 13.662117063978991
_(He laughs loudly.)_ Burying his
grandmother.<eos>: 21.315589055815305
Probably he killed her.

BLOOM: That is one pound six and eleven.<eos>: 48.120935786241134
One pound seven, say.

STEPHEN: Doesn’t matter a rambling damn.

BLOOM: No, but...

STEPHEN: _(Comes to the table.)_ Cigarette, please.<eos>: 40.162829291970574
_(Lynch tosses a
cigarette from the sofa to the table.)_ And so Georgina Johnson is dead
and married.<eos>: 31.634848580309836
_(A cigarette appears on the table.<eos>: 22.793126073396245
Stephen looks at it.)_
Wonder.<eos>: 49.68911417855745
Parlour magic.<eos>: 25.065010243244526
Married.<eos>: 3.02800298563631
Hm.<eos>: 1.4632443430456434
_(He strikes a match and proceeds
to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)_

LYNCH: _(Watching him.)_ You would have a better chance of lighting it
if you held the match nearer.

STEPHEN: _(Brings the match near his eye.)_ Lynx eye.<eos>: 31.55018582253314
Must get glasses.
Broke them yesterday.<eos>: 135.29115574615133
Sixteen years ago.<eos>: 48.973513054406425
Distance.<eos>: 2.0775249359599273
The eye sees all
flat.<eos>: 107.72700622635755
_(He draws the match away.<eos>: 26.76913838276209
It goes out.)_ Brain thinks.<eos>: 113.20200438639816
Near:
far.<eos>: 37.60116902455835
Ineluctable modality of the visible.<eos>: 7.612840141932915
_(He frowns mysteriously.)_
Hm.<eos>: 12.576988557436739
Sphinx.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
The beast that has two backs at midnight.<eos>: 54.884626820151375
Married.

ZOE: It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with
him.

FLORRY: _(Nods.)_ Mr Lambe from London.

STEPHEN: Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.

LYNCH: _(Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis
pacem._

_(The cigarette slips from Stephen’s fingers.<eos>: 37.383785044953996
Bloom picks it up and
throws it in the grate.)_

BLOOM: Don’t smoke.<eos>: 28.703532513885552
You ought to eat.<eos>: 18.287536469529215
Cursed dog I met.<eos>: 37.89355491956947
_(To Zoe.)_ You
have nothing?

ZOE: Is he hungry?

STEPHEN: _(Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the
bloodoath in the_ Dusk of the Gods.)

     Hangende Hunger,
     Fragende Frau,
     Macht uns alle kaputt.

ZOE: _(Tragically.)_ Hamlet, I am thy father’s gimlet!<eos>: 16.439770859846096
_(She takes his
hand.)_ Blue eyes beauty I’ll read your hand.<eos>: 35.36887205975225
_(She points to his
forehead.)_ No wit, no wrinkles.<eos>: 19.46931633475756
_(She counts.)_ Two, three, Mars,
that’s courage.<eos>: 17.571755661684175
_(Stephen shakes his head.)_ No kid.

LYNCH: Sheet lightning courage.<eos>: 37.450072600312886
The youth who could not shiver and
shake.<eos>: 41.36188482387683
_(To Zoe.)_ Who taught you palmistry?

ZOE: _(Turns.)_ Ask my ballocks that I haven’t got.<eos>: 17.816362060433793
_(To Stephen.)_ I
see it in your face.<eos>: 15.088478529784444
The eye, like that.<eos>: 29.238865653440406
_(She frowns with lowered
head.)_

LYNCH: _(Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.)_ Like that.<eos>: 30.767975128596948
Pandybat.

_(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open,
the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs
up.)_

FATHER DOLAN: Any boy want flogging?<eos>: 147.39139719032804
Broke his glasses?<eos>: 27.928973084709828
Lazy idle
little schemer.<eos>: 20.506704339967413
See it in your eye.

_(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises
from the pianola coffin.)_

DON JOHN CONMEE: Now, Father Dolan!<eos>: 42.34049821901608
Now.<eos>: 3.5580361490782746
I’m sure that Stephen is a
very good little boy!

ZOE: _(Examining Stephen’s palm.)_ Woman’s hand.

STEPHEN: _(Murmurs.)_ Continue.<eos>: 18.70156013986441
Lie.<eos>: 2.0486931603416445
Hold me.<eos>: 4.455292842787708
Caress.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
I never could
read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.

ZOE: What day were you born?

STEPHEN: Thursday.<eos>: 49.82914733981551
Today.

ZOE: Thursday’s child has far to go.<eos>: 38.99195131587252
_(She traces lines on his hand.)_
Line of fate.<eos>: 30.87319242958638
Influential friends.

FLORRY: _(Pointing.)_ Imagination.

ZOE: Mount of the moon.<eos>: 19.942392942742995
You’ll meet with a...<eos>: 18.08602777822877
_(She peers at his hands
abruptly.)_ I won’t tell you what’s not good for you.<eos>: 16.827675838887455
Or do you want to
know?

BLOOM: _(Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.)_ More harm than
good.<eos>: 21.45927919714451
Here.<eos>: 3.107997675956089
Read mine.

BELLA: Show.<eos>: 36.197915574874806
_(She turns up Bloom’s hand.)_ I thought so.<eos>: 17.704642989751463
Knobby
knuckles for the women.

ZOE: _(Peering at Bloom’s palm.)_ Gridiron.<eos>: 13.1104786222389
Travels beyond the sea and
marry money.

BLOOM: Wrong.

ZOE: _(Quickly.)_ O, I see.<eos>: 24.968370985109384
Short little finger.<eos>: 34.37369932763343
Henpecked husband.
That wrong?

_(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises,
stretches her wings and clucks.)_

BLACK LIZ: Gara.<eos>: 33.50995654749874
Klook.<eos>: 3.76498154674236
Klook.<eos>: 3.76498154674236
Klook.

_(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)_

BLOOM: _(Points to his hand.)_ That weal there is an accident.<eos>: 16.447761582484862
Fell and
cut it twentytwo years ago.<eos>: 29.59183988205816
I was sixteen.

ZOE: I see, says the blind man.<eos>: 34.932878362768896
Tell us news.

STEPHEN: See?<eos>: 45.34026188131195
Moves to one great goal.<eos>: 24.568432939391148
I am twentytwo.<eos>: 19.852627623958636
Sixteen years
ago he was twentytwo too.<eos>: 58.30937215009365
Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled.
Twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse.<eos>: 109.031317592837
_(He winces.)_
Hurt my hand somewhere.<eos>: 25.618062683132276
Must see a dentist.<eos>: 5.846819686388714
Money?

_(Zoe whispers to Florry.<eos>: 18.833403251723972
They giggle.<eos>: 4.725811313459158
Bloom releases his hand and
writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)_

FLORRY: What?

_(A hackneycar, number three hundred and twentyfour, with a
gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue,
Donnybrook, trots past.<eos>: 31.054525226892785

THE BOOTS: _(Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling
wormfingers.)_ Haw haw have you the horn?

_(Bronze by gold they whisper.)_

ZOE: _(To Florry.)_ Whisper.

_(They whisper again.)_

STEPHEN: _(Amiably.)_ Why not?<eos>: 11.64768111054593
The bold soldier boy.<eos>: 60.83414321769899
In my opinion
every lady for example...

PRIVATE CARR: _(His cap awry, advances to Stephen.)_ Say, how would it
be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?

STEPHEN: _(Looks up to the sky.)_ How?<eos>: 30.94522554765102
Very unpleasant.<eos>: 15.755699115722164
Noble art of
selfpretence.<eos>: 6.564061608885769
Personally, I detest action.<eos>: 20.516654370460294
_(He waves his hand.)_ Hand
hurts me slightly.<eos>: 42.33126215005684
_Enfin ce sont vos oignons._ _(To Cissy Caffrey.)_
Some trouble is on here.<eos>: 11.811602756257349
What is it precisely?

DOLLY GRAY: _(From her balcony waves her handkerchief, giving the sign
of the heroine of Jericho.)_ Rahab.<eos>: 24.881172666311038
Cook’s son, goodbye.<eos>: 9.818010060368039
Safe home to
Dolly.<eos>: 48.07117143105162
Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.

_(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)_

BLOOM: _(Elbowing through the crowd, plucks Stephen’s sleeve
vigorously.)_ Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.

STEPHEN: _(Turns.)_ Eh?<eos>: 26.893750694037124
_(He disengages himself.)_ Why should I not
speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate
orange?<eos>: 101.2601585728209
_(He points his finger.)_ I’m not afraid of what I can talk to
if I see his eye.<eos>: 24.962462967990547
Retaining the perpendicular.

_(He staggers a pace back.)_

BLOOM: _(Propping him.)_ Retain your own.

STEPHEN: _(Laughs emptily.)_ My centre of gravity is displaced.<eos>: 13.154064188926812
I have
forgotten the trick.<eos>: 19.592513319925427
Let us sit down somewhere and discuss.<eos>: 26.341306519365784
Struggle
for life is the law of existence but but human philirenists, notably
the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration.<eos>: 48.52534942662359
_(He taps
his brow.)_ But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.

BIDDY THE CLAP: Did you hear what the professor said?<eos>: 30.561576129996897
He’s a professor
out of the college.

CUNTY KATE: I did.<eos>: 27.749092666398017
I heard that.

BIDDY THE CLAP: He expresses himself with such marked refinement of
phraseology.

CUNTY KATE: Indeed, yes.<eos>: 28.04142743776538
And at the same time with such apposite
trenchancy.

PRIVATE CARR: _(Pulls himself free and comes forward.)_ What’s that
you’re saying about my king?

_(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway.<eos>: 30.29620166154751
He wears a white jersey on
which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched with the insignia of
Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinner’s and
Probyn’s horse, Lincoln’s Inn bencher and ancient and honourable
artillery company of Massachusetts.<eos>: 31.941468768265715
He sucks a red jujube.<eos>: 10.419066013753511
He is robed
as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron,
marked_ made in Germany.<eos>: 51.22223196005996
_In his left hand he holds a plasterer’s
bucket on which is printed_ Défense d’uriner.<eos>: 30.81787034255978
_A roar of welcome greets
him.)_

EDWARD THE SEVENTH: _(Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.)_ Peace,
perfect peace.<eos>: 51.345672297106596
For identification, bucket in my hand.<eos>: 29.984416207105802
Cheerio, boys.
_(He turns to his subjects.)_ We have come here to witness a clean
straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck.
Mahak makar a bak.

_(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom
and Lynch.<eos>: 42.47324778128911
General applause.<eos>: 15.287872104460277
Edward the Seventh lifts his bucket
graciously in acknowledgment.)_

PRIVATE CARR: _(To Stephen.)_ Say it again.

STEPHEN: _(Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.)_ I understand your
point of view though I have no king myself for the moment.<eos>: 36.40369266152347
This is the
age of patent medicines.<eos>: 30.056372098888
A discussion is difficult down here.<eos>: 39.64604461751899
But this
is the point.<eos>: 25.129355223171576
You die for your country.<eos>: 22.52019612362791
Suppose.<eos>: 3.594621334898257
_(He places his arm on
Private Carr’s sleeve.)_ Not that I wish it for you.<eos>: 21.306979604007726
But I say: Let my
country die for me.<eos>: 46.391014653657514
Up to the present it has done so.<eos>: 46.29764584152916
I didn’t want it
to die.<eos>: 10.392067316123132
Damn death.<eos>: 7.847824772929024
Long live life!

EDWARD THE SEVENTH: _(Levitates over heaps of slain, in the garb and
with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent
face.)_

     My methods are new and are causing surprise.
     To make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.

STEPHEN: Kings and unicorns!<eos>: 53.57904900915775
_(He falls back a pace.)_ Come somewhere
and we’ll...<eos>: 33.17677650098918
What was that girl saying?...

PRIVATE COMPTON: Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers.<eos>: 45.85384062090634
Stick one
into Jerry.

BLOOM: _(To the privates, softly.)_ He doesn’t know what he’s saying.
Taken a little more than is good for him.<eos>: 22.834920397928876
Absinthe.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Greeneyed monster.
I know him.<eos>: 54.07613618828404
He’s a gentleman, a poet.<eos>: 15.467253165477075
It’s all right.

STEPHEN: _(Nods, smiling and laughing.)_ Gentleman, patriot, scholar
and judge of impostors.

PRIVATE CARR: I don’t give a bugger who he is.

PRIVATE COMPTON: We don’t give a bugger who he is.

STEPHEN: I seem to annoy them.<eos>: 18.0328416658278
Green rag to a bull.

_(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o’-day
boy’s hat signs to Stephen.)_

KEVIN EGAN: H’lo!<eos>: 105.63072430701415
_Bonjour!_ The _vieille ogresse_ with the _dents
jaunes_.

_(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbitface nibbling a quince
leaf.)_

PATRICE: _Socialiste!_

DON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY: _(In medieval hauberk,
two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a
mailed hand against the privates.)_ Werf those eykes to footboden, big
grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!

BLOOM: _(To Stephen.)_ Come home.<eos>: 22.06441750036855
You’ll get into trouble.

STEPHEN: _(Swaying.)_ I don’t avoid it.<eos>: 10.998409487072937
He provokes my intelligence.

BIDDY THE CLAP: One immediately observes that he is of patrician
lineage.

THE VIRAGO: Green above the red, says he.<eos>: 47.1051311623979
Wolfe Tone.

THE BAWD: The red’s as good as the green.<eos>: 52.02261649149588
And better.<eos>: 17.20540341335894
Up the soldiers!
Up King Edward!

A ROUGH: _(Laughs.)_ Ay!<eos>: 43.62056362342628
Hands up to De Wet.

THE CITIZEN: _(With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)_

     May the God above
     Send down a dove
     With teeth as sharp as razors
     To slit the throats
     Of the English dogs
     That hanged our Irish leaders.

THE CROPPY BOY: _(The ropenoose round his neck, gripes in his issuing
bowels with both hands.)_

     I bear no hate to a living thing,
     But I love my country beyond the king.

RUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER: _(Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants,
advances with gladstone bag which he opens.)_ Ladies and gents, cleaver
purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg.<eos>: 55.81657190279954
Knife with which Voisin
dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the
cellar, the unfortunate female’s throat being cut from ear to ear.
Phial containing arsenic retrieved from body of Miss Barron which sent
Seddon to the gallows.

_(He jerks the rope.<eos>: 76.99199171959053
The assistants leap at the victim’s legs and drag
him downward, grunting: the croppy boy’s tongue protrudes violently.)_

THE CROPPY BOY:

     Horhot ho hray hor hother’s hest.

_(He gives up the ghost.<eos>: 29.810870014025426
A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts
of sperm spouting through his deathclothes on to the cobblestones.<eos>: 31.718209263043263

Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys
rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)_

RUMBOLD: I’m near it myself.<eos>: 35.67924005461051

draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.)_ My
painful duty has now been done.<eos>: 60.69055824920888
God save the king!

EDWARD THE SEVENTH: _(Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket, and
sings with soft contentment.)_

     On coronation day, on coronation day,
     O, won’t we have a merry time,
     Drinking whisky, beer and wine!

PRIVATE CARR: Here.<eos>: 41.26947327928324
What are you saying about my king?

STEPHEN: _(Throws up his hands.)_ O, this is too monotonous!<eos>: 24.479571151099314
Nothing.
He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some
brutish empire of his.<eos>: 102.06528324661998
Money I haven’t.<eos>: 11.7081500733792
_(He searches his pockets
vaguely.)_ Gave it to someone.

PRIVATE CARR: Who wants your bleeding money?

STEPHEN: _(Tries to move off.)_ Will someone tell me where I am least
likely to meet these necessary evils?<eos>: 41.30337234955943
_Ça se voit aussi à Paris._ Not
that I...<eos>: 38.25010603302708
But, by Saint Patrick...!

breast.)_

fucker says a word against my fucking king.

BLOOM: _(Terrified.)_ He said nothing.<eos>: 24.89680596471071
Not a word.<eos>: 9.42750748764769

misunderstanding.

THE CITIZEN: _Erin go bragh!_

Do him one in the eye.<eos>: 26.929824182034835
He’s a proboer.

MAJOR TWEEDY: _(Loudly.)_ Carbine in bucket!<eos>: 25.09004025256937
Cease fire!<eos>: 30.529186829792888
Salute!

THE RETRIEVER: _(Barking furiously.)_ Ute ute ute ute ute ute ute ute.

THE CROWD: Let him up!<eos>: 22.713394382402626
Don’t strike him when he’s down!<eos>: 14.471724714950424
Air!<eos>: 6.110479133242514
Who?<eos>: 5.212224325897694
The
soldier hit him.<eos>: 34.73062857188399
He’s a professor.<eos>: 15.311975627855658
Is he hurted?<eos>: 10.488238015759874
Don’t manhandle him!
He’s fainted!

A HAG: What call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under
the influence.<eos>: 37.233972875305476
Let them go and fight the Boers!

THE BAWD: Listen to who’s talking!<eos>: 67.52780723461699
Hasn’t the soldier a right to go
with his girl?<eos>: 54.24428146235907
He gave him the coward’s blow.

_(They grab at each other’s hair, claw at each other and spit.)_

THE RETRIEVER: _(Barking.)_ Wow wow wow.

BLOOM: _(Shoves them back, loudly.)_ Get back, stand back!

PRIVATE COMPTON: _(Tugging his comrade.)_ Here.<eos>: 16.782573946390134
Bugger off, Harry.
Here’s the cops!<eos>: 28.765224602502226
_(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group.)_

FIRST WATCH: What’s wrong here?

PRIVATE COMPTON: We were with this lady.<eos>: 37.19647292794445
And he insulted us.<eos>: 24.768921940695172
And
assaulted my chum.<eos>: 5.385940115821677
_(The retriever barks.)_ Who owns the bleeding tyke?

CISSY CAFFREY: _(With expectation.)_ Is he bleeding!

A MAN: _(Rising from his knees.)_ No.<eos>: 17.446122515254373
Gone off.<eos>: 9.938752949718443
He’ll come to all
right.

BLOOM: _(Glances sharply at the man.)_ Leave him to me.<eos>: 19.651064010873164
I can easily...

SECOND WATCH: Who are you?<eos>: 31.571864351490966
Do you know him?

PRIVATE CARR: _(Lurches towards the watch.)_ He insulted my lady
friend.

BLOOM: _(Angrily.)_ You hit him without provocation.<eos>: 15.70293241906104
I’m a witness.
Constable, take his regimental number.

SECOND WATCH: I don’t want your instructions in the discharge of my
duty.

PRIVATE COMPTON: _(Pulling his comrade.)_ Here, bugger off Harry.<eos>: 27.265413280339747
Or
Bennett’ll shove you in the lockup.

PRIVATE CARR: _(Staggering as he is pulled away.)_ God fuck old
Bennett.<eos>: 29.404880686555888
He’s a whitearsed bugger.<eos>: 10.6222190154299
I don’t give a shit for him.

FIRST WATCH: _(Takes out his notebook.)_ What’s his name?

BLOOM: _(Peering over the crowd.)_ I just see a car there.<eos>: 15.330147772898378
If you give
me a hand a second, sergeant...

FIRST WATCH: Name and address.

_(Corny Kelleher, weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand,
appears among the bystanders.)_

BLOOM: _(Quickly.)_ O, the very man!<eos>: 26.501398125119795
_(He whispers.)_ Simon Dedalus’
son.<eos>: 29.082685477213346
A bit sprung.<eos>: 8.87919804497928
Get those policemen to move those loafers back.

SECOND WATCH: Night, Mr Kelleher.

CORNY KELLEHER: _(To the watch, with drawling eye.)_ That’s all right.
I know him.<eos>: 31.672902060483757
Won a bit on the races.<eos>: 20.26232325544213
Gold cup.<eos>: 12.267982465029432
Throwaway.<eos>: 2.6036147177973716
_(He laughs.)_
Twenty to one.<eos>: 21.227485147105128
Do you follow me?

FIRST WATCH: _(Turns to the crowd.)_ Here, what are you all gaping at?
Move on out of that.

_(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)_

CORNY KELLEHER: Leave it to me, sergeant.<eos>: 24.84365303413033
That’ll be all right.<eos>: 8.615115608456374
_(He
laughs, shaking his head.)_ We were often as bad ourselves, ay or
worse.<eos>: 49.12821000583751
What?<eos>: 3.8546952873351206
Eh, what?

FIRST WATCH: _(Laughs.)_ I suppose so.

CORNY KELLEHER: _(Nudges the second watch.)_ Come and wipe your name
off the slate.<eos>: 20.396638568265857
_(He lilts, wagging his head.)_ With my tooraloom
tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom.<eos>: 14.511257554333344
What, eh, do you follow me?

SECOND WATCH: _(Genially.)_ Ah, sure we were too.

CORNY KELLEHER: _(Winking.)_ Boys will be boys.<eos>: 18.000739133277147
I’ve a car round there.

SECOND WATCH: All right, Mr Kelleher.<eos>: 30.953402589183366
Good night.

CORNY KELLEHER: I’ll see to that.

BLOOM: _(Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.)_ Thank you very
much, gentlemen.<eos>: 29.661085097995755
Thank you.<eos>: 3.1953277633113566
_(He mumbles confidentially.)_ We don’t
want any scandal, you understand.<eos>: 11.718481489671223
Father is a wellknown highly
respected citizen.<eos>: 45.61068960402067
Just a little wild oats, you understand.

FIRST WATCH: O.<eos>: 44.150461424919015
I understand, sir.

SECOND WATCH: That’s all right, sir.

FIRST WATCH: It was only in case of corporal injuries I’d have to
report it at the station.

BLOOM: _(Nods rapidly.)_ Naturally.<eos>: 29.404042496694903
Quite right.<eos>: 6.63811189864246
Only your bounden
duty.

SECOND WATCH: It’s our duty.

CORNY KELLEHER: Good night, men.

THE WATCH: _(Saluting together.)_ Night, gentlemen.<eos>: 26.08039539133468
_(They move off
with slow heavy tread.)_

BLOOM: _(Blows.)_ Providential you came on the scene.<eos>: 33.08156823809109
You have a
car?...

CORNY KELLEHER: _(Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to
the car brought up against the scaffolding.)_ Two commercials that were
standing fizz in Jammet’s.<eos>: 31.72549352239291
Like princes, faith.<eos>: 23.94835376306732
One of them lost two
quid on the race.<eos>: 49.78284970300073
Drowning his grief.<eos>: 25.25393947782857
And were on for a go with the
jolly girls.<eos>: 83.87018510275298
So I landed them up on Behan’s car and down to nighttown.

BLOOM: I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...

CORNY KELLEHER: _(Laughs.)_ Sure they wanted me to join in with the
mots.<eos>: 34.22568625698789
No, by God, says I.<eos>: 13.639481748995955
Not for old stagers like myself and yourself.
_(He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.)_ Thanks be to God we
have it in the house, what, eh, do you follow me?<eos>: 36.48148033427067
Hah, hah, hah!

BLOOM: _(Tries to laugh.)_ He, he, he!<eos>: 12.869762742828472
Yes.<eos>: 2.0880743848448278
Matter of fact I was just
visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don’t know him (poor
fellow, he’s laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together
and I was just making my way home...

_(The horse neighs.)_

THE HORSE: Hohohohohohoh!<eos>: 60.91514522572459
Hohohohome!

CORNY KELLEHER: Sure it was Behan our jarvey there that told me after
we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen’s and I told him to pull up
and got off to see.<eos>: 52.76926086737634
_(He laughs.)_ Sober hearsedrivers a speciality.
Will I give him a lift home?<eos>: 31.892837991269293
Where does he hang out?<eos>: 50.00619215082417
Somewhere in
Cabra, what?

BLOOM: No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.

_(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars.<eos>: 37.28431410908167
Corny Kelleher, asquint,
drawls at the horse.<eos>: 10.044931891288819
Bloom, in gloom, looms down.)_

CORNY KELLEHER: _(Scratches his nape.)_ Sandycove!<eos>: 16.068852971400617
_(He bends down and
calls to Stephen.)_ Eh!<eos>: 17.848723984127357
_(He calls again.)_ Eh!<eos>: 14.344457056958321
He’s covered with
shavings anyhow.<eos>: 30.17172019522626
Take care they didn’t lift anything off him.

BLOOM: No, no, no.<eos>: 29.325435857084553
I have his money and his hat here and stick.

CORNY KELLEHER: Ah, well, he’ll get over it.<eos>: 41.84877383375969
No bones broken.<eos>: 75.56026671793585
Well,
I’ll shove along.<eos>: 22.295213731076426
_(He laughs.)_ I’ve a rendezvous in the morning.
Burying the dead.<eos>: 14.76415796737642
Safe home!

THE HORSE: _(Neighs.)_ Hohohohohome.

BLOOM: Good night.<eos>: 12.690928299434617
I’ll just wait and take him along in a few...

_(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it.<eos>: 49.92371002081285
The horse
harness jingles.)_

CORNY KELLEHER: _(From the car, standing.)_ Night.

BLOOM: Night.

_(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly.<eos>: 24.836122507538963
The
car and horse back slowly, awkwardly, and turn.<eos>: 81.54207016930275
Corny Kelleher on the
sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Bloom’s plight.
The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the
farther seat.<eos>: 40.238996863765834
Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply.<eos>: 39.75581951252587
With thumb
and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the
sleep to continue for what else is to be done.<eos>: 84.52564991335421
With a slow nod Bloom
conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs.<eos>: 131.42606461665002
The car
jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane.<eos>: 80.03748973010129
Corny
Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand.<eos>: 15.428156539368036
Bloom with his hand
assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay.<eos>: 43.511223240020904
The tinkling
hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo
lay.<eos>: 80.19254596101526
Bloom, holding in his hand Stephen’s hat, festooned with shavings,
and ashplant, stands irresolute.<eos>: 23.030587430336695
Then he bends to him and shakes him by
the shoulder.)_

BLOOM: Eh!<eos>: 39.544128490655694
Ho!<eos>: 7.014603794331746
_(There is no answer; he bends again.)_ Mr Dedalus!
_(There is no answer.)_ The name if you call.<eos>: 42.568030780902276
Somnambulist.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
_(He bends
again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate
form.)_ Stephen!<eos>: 29.572482607774646
_(There is no answer.<eos>: 19.549709799475664
He calls again.)_ Stephen!

STEPHEN: _(Groans.)_ Who?<eos>: 11.720068032674371

— III —


[ 16 ]

Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of
the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up
generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed.<eos>: 76.10366519421108
His
(Stephen’s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a
bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr
Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry
water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit
upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the
cabman’s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt
bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk
and soda or a mineral.<eos>: 92.89120516092483
But how to get there was the rub.<eos>: 47.788558146856204
For the nonce
he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon
him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and
means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned.<eos>: 88.84233500934216
So far as he could see he
was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly
advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in
their then condition, both of them being e.d.ed, particularly Stephen,
always assuming that there was such a thing to be found.<eos>: 80.16429551043078
Accordingly
after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having
forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had
done yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together
along Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier’s and
the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of
Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence
debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin’s.<eos>: 82.1710204566842
But
as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for
hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some
fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was
no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was
anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by
emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head,
twice.

This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently
there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it
which they accordingly did.<eos>: 83.23412587072322
So, bevelling around by Mullett’s and the
Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the
direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped
by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had,
to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though,
entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made
light of the mischance.<eos>: 58.78927611249956
So as neither of them were particularly pressed
for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it
cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they
dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a
fare or a jarvey.<eos>: 85.1471691184305
As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company’s
sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his
companion _à propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of
some little while back.<eos>: 87.63203068166534
They passed the main entrance of the Great
Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of
course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the
backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say
gruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the
Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its
C division police station.<eos>: 123.49168863019672
Between this point and the high at present
unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen,
associated with Baird’s the stonecutter’s in his mind somehow in Talbot
place, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as
his _fidus Achates_ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of
James Rourke’s city bakery, situated quite close to where they were,
the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities
of the public the primary and most indispensable.<eos>: 74.6272532705435
Bread, the staff of
life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke’s the
baker’s it is said.

_En route_ to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not
yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in
complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact
disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution _re_ the dangers of
nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely
permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice, was of
the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age
particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence
of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as
even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if
you didn’t look out.<eos>: 100.17699155226144
Highly providential was the appearance on the
scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for
that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might
have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or,
failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day
before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant
to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got
bruited about.<eos>: 73.86155533905585
The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those
policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in
the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or
two in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole
through a ten gallon pot.<eos>: 79.69299392872922
Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet
parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law
were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to
protect the upper classes.<eos>: 91.88186605426772
Another thing he commented on was equipping
soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off
at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians
should by any chance they fall out over anything.<eos>: 88.06912054028615
You frittered away
your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character
besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the
_demimonde_ ran away with a lot of £.<eos>: 96.20930457598136
s.<eos>: 4.405906724215668
d.<eos>: 5.129374379987754
into the bargain and the
greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the
much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old
wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing
aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch
believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably
drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of
your being at the tender mercy of others practically.<eos>: 118.02236342948373
Most of all he
commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting
_confrères_ but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his
brother medicos under all the circs.

—And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing
whatsoever of any kind.

Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back
of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a
brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one
attracted their rather lagging footsteps.<eos>: 54.739222201804814
Stephen of his own accord
stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren
cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just
make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom
of the sentrybox.<eos>: 79.81648969963342
He began to remember that this had happened or had
been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small
effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a
_quondam_ friend of his father’s, Gumley.<eos>: 108.47331302040949
To avoid a meeting he drew
nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.

—Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.

A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches
saluted again, calling:

—Night!

Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the
compliment.<eos>: 65.731339592927
Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch
as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but
nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety
though not funkyish in the least.<eos>: 50.42071293822925
Though unusual in the Dublin area he
knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next
to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising
peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some
secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames
embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply
marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell
swoop at a moment’s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there
to point a moral, gagged and garrotted.

Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters,
though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley’s
breath redolent of rotten cornjuice.<eos>: 103.57754116449159
Lord John Corley some called him
and his genealogy came about in this wise.<eos>: 135.20244789490235
He was the eldest son of
inspector Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married a
certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer.<eos>: 59.927993390546355
His
grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of
a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.
Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of
the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably
fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or
some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had
enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen.<eos>: 129.15883515394526
This
therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though
dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with
facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.

Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.
Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings.<eos>: 122.48947223096216
His friends
had all deserted him.<eos>: 29.429981886612826
Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called
him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of
other uncalledfor expressions.<eos>: 63.853471818063795
He was out of a job and implored of
Stephen to tell him where on God’s earth he could get something,
anything at all, to do.<eos>: 49.45288473539125
No, it was the daughter of the mother in the
washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they
were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences
happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn’t a complete
fabrication from start to finish.<eos>: 54.282460639958266
Anyhow he was all in.

—I wouldn’t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows
I’m on the rocks.

—There’ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys’
school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher.<eos>: 53.314904454427236
Mr Garrett Deasy.<eos>: 10.104898686276766
Try it.<eos>: 5.750371599283686
You
may mention my name.

—Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn’t teach in a school, man.<eos>: 37.92447565068792
I was
never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh.<eos>: 45.0182660612186
I got stuck
twice in the junior at the christian brothers.

—I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.

Corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to
do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody
tart off the street.<eos>: 87.14201079519572
There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs
Maloney’s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but
M’Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over
in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person
addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob.<eos>: 60.405338071383085
He was starving too though he
hadn’t said a word about it.

Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it
still Stephen’s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he
knew that Corley’s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was
hardly deserving of much credence.<eos>: 89.25582844712788
However _haud ignarus malorum
miseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the Latin poet remarks especially
as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the
month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of
fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished.<eos>: 56.983405346142646
But the cream
of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley’s head that he was
living in affluence and hadn’t a thing to do but hand out the needful.
Whereas.<eos>: 62.18720931831761
He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of
finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a
bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get
sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his
chagrin, he found his cash missing.<eos>: 96.07126291659941
A few broken biscuits were all the
result of his investigation.<eos>: 39.802570571451774
He tried his hardest to recollect for the
moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in
that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse
in fact.<eos>: 55.14683868453656
He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough
search though he tried to recollect.<eos>: 40.61411026589178
About biscuits he dimly
remembered.<eos>: 53.86190694965302
Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did
he buy.<eos>: 148.74727638417616
However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in
the dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out.

—Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.

And so in point of fact they turned out to be.<eos>: 71.17386963120353
Stephen anyhow lent him
one of them.

—Thanks, Corley answered, you’re a gentleman.<eos>: 29.85999743955663
I’ll pay you back one
time.<eos>: 21.3196295698218
Who’s that with you?<eos>: 16.389801161536763
I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse
in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker.<eos>: 33.84460384669989
You might put in a good
word for us to get me taken on there.<eos>: 40.042815134841085
I’d carry a sandwichboard only
the girl in the office told me they’re full up for the next three
weeks, man.<eos>: 47.38547871128467
God, you’ve to book ahead, man, you’d think it was for the
Carl Rosa.<eos>: 25.79063934344171
I don’t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as
a crossing sweeper.

Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six
he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky
that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam’s, the shipchandler’s,
bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle’s back with
O’Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe.<eos>: 55.337982121862176
Anyhow he
was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and
disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.

Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the
cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation
watchman’s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him,
was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own
private account while Dublin slept.<eos>: 71.49898183921164
He threw an odd eye at the same
time now and then at Stephen’s anything but immaculately attired
interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though
where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the
remotest idea when.<eos>: 77.23134981700841
Being a levelheaded individual who could give
points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on
his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally
testifying to a chronic impecuniosity.<eos>: 84.98922836551493
Palpably he was one of his
hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one
preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put
it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street
chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the
option of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether.<eos>: 54.25760444917621
In any case he
had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that
hour of the night or morning.<eos>: 43.67114474146233
Pretty thick that was certainly.

The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his
practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the
blandiloquence of the other parasite.<eos>: 47.71329327495297
Alluding to the encounter he
said, laughingly, Stephen, that is:

—He is down on his luck.<eos>: 30.15239408565624
He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named
Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.

At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr
Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the
direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana,
moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair,
whereupon he observed evasively:

—Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say.<eos>: 49.187059603015236
Now you mention it
his face was familiar to me.<eos>: 48.11452141452086
But, leaving that for the moment, how much
did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?

—Half a crown, Stephen responded.<eos>: 45.869185272540776
I daresay he needs it to sleep
somewhere.

—Needs!<eos>: 78.19326601796035
Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the
intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he
invariably does.<eos>: 56.68625796358598
Everyone according to his needs or everyone according
to his deeds.<eos>: 75.27749537560962
But, talking about things in general, where, added he
with a smile, will you sleep yourself?<eos>: 80.84645045480211
Walking to Sandycove is out of
the question.<eos>: 38.93850045127224
And even supposing you did you won’t get in after what
occurred at Westland Row station.<eos>: 57.50371371855705
Simply fag out there for nothing.<eos>: 21.20288378702952
I
don’t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why
did you leave your father’s house?

—To seek misfortune, was Stephen’s answer.

—I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom
diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on
yesterday.<eos>: 53.52084074831594
Where does he live at present?<eos>: 54.88138825080564
I gathered in the course of
conversation that he had moved.

—I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.
Why?

—A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects
than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one.<eos>: 50.03629761838385
He takes great
pride, quite legitimate, out of you.<eos>: 55.455203775204694
You could go back perhaps, he
hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row
terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan,
that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred
their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally
station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion,
which they did.

There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it
was, Stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his
family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by
the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell
cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he
could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings
they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and
Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells
and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in
accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on
the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or
something like that.

—No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn’t personally repose much trust
in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element,
Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your
shoes.<eos>: 90.6886338447922
He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all
probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals.
Of course you didn’t notice as much as I did.<eos>: 79.88092058503585
But it wouldn’t occasion
me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic
was put in your drink for some ulterior object.

He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a
versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was
rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified,
bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future
as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services
in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from
certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid
at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an
exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that
frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be
at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or
jealousy, pure and simple.

—Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking
your brains, he ventured to throw out.

The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by
friendliness which he gave at Stephen’s at present morose expression of
features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the
problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge
by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about
saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to
himself allowed matters to more or less.<eos>: 112.77989354775708
Grinding poverty did have that
effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities
though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both
ends meet.

Adjacent to the men’s public urinal they perceived an icecream car
round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were
getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a
particularly animated way, there being some little differences between
the parties.

—_Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini!<eos>: 102.46951499082347
Ho ragione?<eos>: 10.877451615919414
Culo rotto!_

_—Intendiamoci.<eos>: 9.458533035103674
Mezzo sovrano più..._

_—Dice lui, però!_

_—Mezzo._

_—Farabutto!<eos>: 8.744186974171443
Mortacci sui!_

_—Ma ascolta!<eos>: 14.441078904857402
Cinque la testa più..._

Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman’s shelter, an unpretentious
wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been
before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few
hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat
Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual
facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in.<eos>: 62.16774884536001
A few
moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet
corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous
collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the
genus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified
by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked
curiosity.

—Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest
to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the
shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.

Accordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order
these commodities quietly.<eos>: 83.34293111904938
The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or
whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes
apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous
individual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still
stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention
to the floor.<eos>: 69.60782620762896
Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech,
he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute,
though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his
_protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in
the street which was still raging fast and furious:

—A beautiful language.<eos>: 71.17721069734044
I mean for singing purposes.<eos>: 78.71871793263587
Why do you not
write your poetry in that language?<eos>: 41.04902069493026
_Bella Poetria_!<eos>: 5.656895749079418
It is so melodious
and full.<eos>: 25.08628099694072
_Belladonna.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Voglio._

Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering
from lassitude generally, replied:

—To fill the ear of a cow elephant.<eos>: 111.74292994618314
They were haggling over money.

—Is that so?<eos>: 26.349265679288738
Mr Bloom asked.<eos>: 5.206655076411915
Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the
inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were
absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that
surrounds it.

The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tête-à-tête_ put a
boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the
table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed.
After which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to
have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to.<eos>: 91.8197305263261
For
which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he
did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was
temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.

—Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time,
like names.<eos>: 86.06578876452608
Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody.<eos>: 6.885282173004114
Jesus, Mr Doyle.
Shakespeares were as common as Murphies.<eos>: 45.0770294081625
What’s in a name?

—Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred.<eos>: 12.57088011892022
Of course.<eos>: 11.522910931874808
Our name
was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.

The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded
Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely
by asking:

—And what might your name be?

Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion’s boot but
Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected
quarter, answered:

—Dedalus.

The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes,
rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old
Hollands and water.

—You know Simon Dedalus?<eos>: 74.63142009332027
he asked at length.

—I’ve heard of him, Stephen said.

Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently
eavesdropping too.

—He’s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same
way and nodding.<eos>: 49.29073076977425
All Irish.

—All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.

As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole
business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when
the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the
shelter with the remark:

—I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his
shoulder.<eos>: 108.27261098468318
The lefthand dead shot.

Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his
gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.

—Bottles out there, say.<eos>: 94.93979950391753
Fifty yards measured.<eos>: 154.12982358440283
Eggs on the bottles.
Cocks his gun over his shoulder.<eos>: 21.309799876018214
Aims.

He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely.<eos>: 83.87401936571125
Then
he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the
night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.

—Pom!<eos>: 73.47224044130073
he then shouted once.

The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation,
there being still a further egg.

—Pom!<eos>: 97.84929180252344
he shouted twice.

Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding
bloodthirstily:

_—Buffalo Bill shoots to kill,

Never missed nor he never will._

A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness’ sake just felt like
asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the
Bisley.

—Beg pardon, the sailor said.

—Long ago?<eos>: 92.50428785969268
Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.

—Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic
influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years.<eos>: 44.901722233205284
He
toured the wide world with Hengler’s Royal Circus.<eos>: 31.43929116911318
I seen him do that
in Stockholm.

—Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.

—Murphy’s my name, the sailor continued.<eos>: 32.99582900702636
D.<eos>: 5.129374379987754
B.<eos>: 2.4980998021278107
Murphy of Carrigaloe.
Know where that is?

—Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.

—That’s right, the sailor said.<eos>: 20.126702838000906
Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle.<eos>: 27.077293437985247
That’s
where I hails from.<eos>: 22.69332291160945
I belongs there.<eos>: 24.11038705970892
That’s where I hails from.<eos>: 22.69332291160945
My
little woman’s down there.<eos>: 19.991904561862622
She’s waiting for me, I know.<eos>: 13.017410547130583
_For England,
home and beauty_.<eos>: 19.958305450435326
She’s my own true wife I haven’t seen for seven years
now, sailing about.

Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming
to the mariner’s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a
rainy night with a blind moon.<eos>: 63.15214901031418
Across the world for a wife.<eos>: 12.126412019245201
Quite a
number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic,
Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember
Caoc O’Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way
of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.
Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the
absentee.<eos>: 108.33953374053364
The face at the window!<eos>: 37.58814412075575
Judge of his astonishment when he
finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent
his better half, wrecked in his affections.<eos>: 46.39815461562772
You little expected me but
I’ve come to stay and make a fresh start.<eos>: 54.67854996706038
There she sits, a grasswidow,
at the selfsame fireside.<eos>: 14.736624541215646
Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the
deep.<eos>: 22.59490621143289
And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the
publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and
onions.<eos>: 45.89498524764176
No chair for father.<eos>: 39.254036385349224
Broo!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
The wind!<eos>: 21.23768234401337
Her brandnew arrival is on
her knee, _post mortem_ child.<eos>: 57.8335843180816
With a high ro!<eos>: 24.435864642018917
and a randy ro!<eos>: 9.97636049283472
and my
galloping tearing tandy, O!<eos>: 68.85711934891361
Bow to the inevitable.<eos>: 14.934779900123965
Grin and bear it.<eos>: 21.796835037768727

Murphy.

The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one
of the jarvies with the request:

—You don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?

The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die
of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object
was passed from hand to hand.

—Thank you, the sailor said.

He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow
stammers, proceeded:

—We come up this morning eleven o’clock.<eos>: 64.66287474093747

In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket
and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.

—You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked,
leaning on the counter.

—Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I’ve circumnavigated
a bit since I first joined on.<eos>: 64.37655144808642
I was in the Red Sea.<eos>: 14.908999206236537
I was in China and
North America and South America.<eos>: 71.00318656238363
We was chased by pirates one voyage.<eos>: 14.10432088361376
I
seen icebergs plenty, growlers.<eos>: 23.206523139920606
I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea,
the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever
scuttled a ship.<eos>: 39.134835477554994
I seen Russia.<eos>: 14.893559613208165
_Gospodi pomilyou_.<eos>: 2.842387380473868
That’s how the
Russians prays.

—You seen queer sights, don’t be talking, put in a jarvey.

—Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug.<eos>: 35.77620397406615
I seen queer
things too, ups and downs.<eos>: 34.193981734711784
I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an
anchor same as I chew that quid.

He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his
teeth, bit ferociously:

—Khaan!<eos>: 53.13263561329902
Like that.<eos>: 5.084438106028934
And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and
the livers of horses.<eos>: 39.93252515153784
Look here.<eos>: 9.00165704182621
Here they are.<eos>: 14.098050558187854
A friend of mine sent
me.

He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed
to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table.
The printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios.<eos>: 57.96588156669293
Beni, Bolivia._

All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage
women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning,
sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of
them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.

—Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added.<eos>: 42.65525494873867
Stomachs like
breadgraters.<eos>: 6.833278812838675
Cuts off their diddies when they can’t bear no more
children.

See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse’s liver
raw.

His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns
for several minutes if not more.

—Know how to keep them off?<eos>: 139.64493763754166
he inquired generally.

Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying:

—Glass.<eos>: 73.05369300320459
That boggles ’em.<eos>: 19.465318954676718
Glass.

Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the
card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark.<eos>: 43.61860619552881
It ran
as follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago,
Chile._ There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.
Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the
eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the
Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which
occasion the former’s ball passed through the latter’s hat) having
detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he
represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after
having boxed the compass on the strict q.t.<eos>: 71.17445118726651
somewhere) and the
fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some
suspicions of our friend’s _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in
a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some
Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say
that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was
at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had
consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead
which was his longest.<eos>: 81.07312135101218
Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work
a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up
with the net result that the scheme fell through.<eos>: 127.63351901968684
But even suppose it
did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd’s heart it was
not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering
the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there
and back.<eos>: 105.50502726792962
The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone
and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose
liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route,
Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive
tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern
Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower,
abbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with.<eos>: 87.67594058102574
Another thing
just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze
around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a
concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure
resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas,
Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the
Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly
remunerative.<eos>: 68.51631221827004
Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or
local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M’Coy type lend me your valise
and I’ll post you the ticket.<eos>: 161.68036737594963
No, something top notch, an all star
Irish caste, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with his own legal
consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes
and Moody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of
success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some
fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and
thus combine business with pleasure.<eos>: 106.03535084458412
But who?<eos>: 10.792757584885432
That was the rub.

Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was
to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with
the times _apropos_ of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was
mooted, was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments
with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete
fogeydom and dunderheads generally.<eos>: 53.295127783976774
A great opportunity there certainly
was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public
at large, the average man, i.e.<eos>: 80.53426634875058
Brown, Robinson and Co.

It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no
small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the
system really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry
pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead
of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took
me for a wife.<eos>: 111.07770270863384
After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more
humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the
grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at
her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.
There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home
island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora
of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around
Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there
was a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in
Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood
for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn’t come down, and in the wilds
of Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d’œil_ was exceedingly
grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that
the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering
the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic
associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O’Malley, George IV,
rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt
with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when
young men’s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off
the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their
left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour’s run from the
pillar.<eos>: 81.07903160994012
Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely
in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be
desired.<eos>: 66.78952864065128
Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of
curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created
the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact.<eos>: 66.57516267194585
He turned back the
other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.

—I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had
little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened
and every pill was something different.<eos>: 67.75405387944558
One was a ship, another was a
house, another was a flower.<eos>: 53.92383781582075
Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly
added, the chinks does.

Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the
globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.

—And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap.<eos>: 61.83524701777659
Knife in his
back.<eos>: 24.930684192669816
Knife like that.

Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in
keeping with his character and held it in the striking position.

—In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.
Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him.<eos>: 86.50862200029687
Like that.<eos>: 5.084438106028934
_Prepare to
meet your God_, says he.<eos>: 17.705599731502996
Chuk!<eos>: 6.847652203139855
It went into his back up to the butt.

His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further
questions even should they by any chance want to.

—That’s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable
_stiletto_.

After which harrowing _dénouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he
snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before
in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.

—They’re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in
the dark said for the benefit of them all.<eos>: 93.06865178466713
That was why they thought
the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account
of them using knives.

At this remark passed obviously in the spirit of _where ignorance is
bliss_ Mr B.<eos>: 74.6910584422334
and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both
instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the
strictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat,
_alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid
from his boiler affair.<eos>: 93.93866463905985
His inscrutable face which was really a work of
art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the
impression that he didn’t understand one jot of what was going on.
Funny, very!

There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause.<eos>: 83.6685291775551
One man was reading in fits and
starts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the
natives _choza de_, another the seaman’s discharge.<eos>: 80.18638417676367
Mr Bloom, so far as
he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood.<eos>: 43.583641909909915
He
vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well
as yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the
land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively
speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was
just turned fifteen.

—Ay, boss, the sailor broke in.<eos>: 73.41328812527298
Give us back them papers.

The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.

—Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar?<eos>: 54.611168798392804
Mr Bloom inquired.

The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or
no.

—Ah, you’ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he
had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences
but he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the
sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.

—What year would that be about?<eos>: 64.19504461067149
Mr B interrogated.<eos>: 13.2593108618862
Can you recall the
boats?

Our _soi-disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before
answering:

—I’m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.
Salt junk all the time.

Tired seemingly, he ceased.<eos>: 74.91759606915241
His questioner perceiving that he was not
likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer,
fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the
globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed,
it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly
what it meant to rule the waves.<eos>: 61.16603927558981
On more than one occasion, a dozen at
the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a
superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the
not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at
it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone
somewhere sings.<eos>: 123.99137036045906
And it left him wondering why.<eos>: 53.70289567454208
Possibly he had tried
to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the
antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not
exactly under, tempting the fates.<eos>: 66.3247117744371
And the odds were twenty to nil
there was really no secret about it at all.<eos>: 66.3120669376419
Nevertheless, without going
into the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained that
the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things
somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence
though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that
sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery
and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for
that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable
institution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland
or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like
that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and
coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid
the elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that
every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the
wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to
capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had
experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.

—There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_, the old seadog,
himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as
gentleman’s valet at six quid a month.<eos>: 92.55259594926937
Them are his trousers I’ve on me
and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife.<eos>: 34.08416600043259
I’m game for that job,
shaving and brushup.<eos>: 27.010928413688227
I hate roaming about.<eos>: 20.930025258078338
There’s my son now, Danny,
run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper’s in Cork where
he could be drawing easy money.

—What age is he?<eos>: 70.73063256657831
queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the
side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away
from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy
getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.

—Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?
He’d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.

The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow
shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was
to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent
an anchor.

—There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts.
I must get a wash tomorrow or next day.<eos>: 65.86210507702161
It’s them black lads I objects
to.<eos>: 62.44648450745868
I hate those buggers.<eos>: 18.03767114812073
Suck your blood dry, they does.

Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged
his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the
mariner’s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a
young man’s sideface looking frowningly rather.

—Tattoo, the exhibitor explained.<eos>: 81.38463337032044
That was done when we were lying
becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton.<eos>: 50.788417189464916
Fellow, the
name of Antonio, done that.<eos>: 33.522254961833625
There he is himself, a Greek.

—Did it hurt much doing it?<eos>: 50.27686818085287
one asked the sailor.

That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.
Someway in his.<eos>: 73.78460261427608
Squeezing or.

—See here, he said, showing Antonio.<eos>: 36.415552812831706
There he is cursing the mate.<eos>: 9.774174396760033
And
there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his
fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.

And in point of fact the young man named Antonio’s livid face did
actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the
unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this
time stretched over.

—Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest.<eos>: 84.1117497894687
He’s gone
too.<eos>: 10.51781189574525
Ate by sharks after.<eos>: 22.494347245798384
Ay, ay.

He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression
of before.

—Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.

—And what’s the number for?<eos>: 81.2937887354605
loafer number two queried.

—Eaten alive?<eos>: 172.85916175417333
a third asked the sailor.

—Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time
with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the
direction of the questioner about the number.<eos>: 62.87095700404243
Ate.<eos>: 3.6191745748928055
A Greek he was.

And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his
alleged end:

     —As bad as old Antonio,
     For he left me on my ownio.

The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat
peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on
her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill.<eos>: 72.29519266151507
Mr Bloom,
scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment
flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink
sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had
laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though
why pink.<eos>: 113.63690051299841
His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round
the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that
afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the
lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.)
and begged the chance of his washing.<eos>: 116.98338396295445
Also why washing which seemed
rather vague than not, your washing.<eos>: 238.09836974972873
Still candour compelled him to
admit he had washed his wife’s undergarments when soiled in Holles
street and women would and did too a man’s similar garments initialled
with Bewley and Draper’s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they
really loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt.<eos>: 67.08263867836756
Still
just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female’s room more than
her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a
rude sign to take herself off.<eos>: 124.10982820180827
Round the side of the _Evening
Telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side
of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was
not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of
gazers round skipper Murphy’s nautical chest and then there was no more
of her.

—The gunboat, the keeper said.

—It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking,
how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with
disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober
senses, if he values his health in the least.<eos>: 50.115675405219235
Unfortunate creature!<eos>: 27.88298479359619
Of
course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.
Still no matter what the cause is from...

Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely
remarking:

—In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a
roaring trade.<eos>: 103.97911526159096
Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to
buy the soul.<eos>: 112.11574650003229
She is a bad merchant.<eos>: 27.754034571586104
She buys dear and sells cheap.

The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a
prude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be
put a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart
from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil,
were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a
thing, he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a
stalwart advocate of from the very first start.<eos>: 88.33875559020836
Whoever embarked on a
policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would
confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.

—You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe
in the soul.<eos>: 52.99589071393815
Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such,
as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup.<eos>: 64.84776933657514
I
believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men
as the convolutions of the grey matter.<eos>: 58.18562553767652
Otherwise we would never have
such inventions as X rays, for instance.<eos>: 68.338218959
Do you?

Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try
and concentrate and remember before he could say:

—They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and
therefore incorruptible.<eos>: 66.95594457675996
It would be immortal, I understand, but for
the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I
can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other
practical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both
being excluded by court etiquette.

Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the
mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he
felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly
rejoining:

—Simple?<eos>: 72.94474829846305
I shouldn’t think that is the proper word.<eos>: 19.34291204534924
Of course, I grant
you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a
blue moon.<eos>: 83.30459500640102
But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for
instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison,
though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean,
and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural
phenomenon such as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour
to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.

—O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several
of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial
evidence.

On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they
were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference
in their respective ages, clashed.

—Has been?<eos>: 74.10198931720035
the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his
original point with a smile of unbelief.<eos>: 37.600697926360866
I’m not so sure about that.
That’s a matter for everyman’s opinion and, without dragging in the
sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you _in toto_
there.<eos>: 38.310404414262514
My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were
genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it’s the
big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them
like _Hamlet_ and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely
better than I, of course I needn’t tell you.<eos>: 130.87710853794982
Can’t you drink that
coffee, by the way?<eos>: 34.61935203202885
Let me stir it.<eos>: 26.13550920166261
And take a piece of that bun.<eos>: 27.04833459442034
It’s
like one of our skipper’s bricks disguised.<eos>: 14.24854918846568
Still no-one can give what
he hasn’t got.<eos>: 38.93584674062305
Try a bit.

—Couldn’t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the
moment refusing to dictate further.

Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir
or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with
something approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance
(and lucrative) work.<eos>: 76.2121579529593
To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond
yea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they
were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic
evenings and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the
lower orders.<eos>: 94.49639621788253
On the other hand he had a distinct and painful
recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been
prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration
indeed for her pianoplaying.<eos>: 52.10765901535521
The idea, he was strongly inclined to
believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to
speak of.<eos>: 101.52888726460345
Sulphate of copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas
he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he
couldn’t remember when it was or where.<eos>: 81.67208551132478
Anyhow inspection, medical
inspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary
which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble’s Vi-Cocoa on
account of the medical analysis involved.

—Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being
stirred.

Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug
from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and
took a sip of the offending beverage.

—Still it’s solid food, his good genius urged, I’m a stickler for solid
food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but
regular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work, mental
or manual.<eos>: 66.20426054020545
You ought to eat more solid food.<eos>: 58.861726456346666
You would feel a different
man.

—Liquids I can eat, Stephen said.<eos>: 26.996821766626372
But O, oblige me by taking away that
knife.<eos>: 55.91443333370726
I can’t look at the point of it.<eos>: 11.41699482107167
It reminds me of Roman history.

Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated
article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly
Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was
the least conspicuous point about it.

—Our mutual friend’s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom _apropos_ of
knives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_.<eos>: 84.37776204539999
Do you think they are
genuine?<eos>: 33.9344044710191
He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and
lie like old boots.<eos>: 124.3439296299394
Look at him.

Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was
full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it
was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire
fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent
probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly
accurate gospel.

He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and
Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him.<eos>: 104.5058636120177
Though a
wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness,
there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a
jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to
associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill
fraternity.<eos>: 42.44822795599642
He might even have done for his man supposing it was his
own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he
killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in
durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to
the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our
national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above
described.<eos>: 133.21276919580703
On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable
weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like
those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner
who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner
_Hesperus_ and etcetera.<eos>: 84.03058674504297
And when all was said and done the lies a
fellow told about himself couldn’t probably hold a proverbial candle to
the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.

—Mind you, I’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention, he resumed.
Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with.<eos>: 116.65168773571824
Giants,
though that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the
midget queen.<eos>: 59.95249298569644
In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some
Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn’t straighten
their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he
proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews
or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly
powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as
gods.<eos>: 88.06777467391824
There’s an example again of simple souls.

However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who
reminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied the
boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the
management in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host
of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him
though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually
fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically
incompatible about it, he conceded.<eos>: 63.49915521723714
On the contrary that stab in the
back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he
was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the
fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in
little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking
fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless
necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to
have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or
her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.

—Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like
that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own
hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they
carry in the abdomen.<eos>: 72.161432797659
It comes from the great heat, climate generally.
My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is.<eos>: 63.27830719165141
Point of fact she could
actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in
(technically) Spain, i.e.<eos>: 71.50554773664679
Gibraltar.<eos>: 2.979774831103741
She has the Spanish type.<eos>: 31.59989337785559
Quite
dark, regular brunette, black.<eos>: 34.78520722479813
I for one certainly believe climate
accounts for character.<eos>: 123.19555634455504
That’s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry
in Italian.

—The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very
passionate about ten shillings.<eos>: 58.38227690530101
_Roberto ruba roba sua_.

—Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.

—Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown
listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles
triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san
Tommaso Mastino.

—It’s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once.<eos>: 32.328170133660954
All are washed in the
blood of the sun.<eos>: 21.52190677653608
Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare
street museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it,
and I was just looking at those antique statues there.<eos>: 85.49246837373968
The splendid
proportions of hips, bosom.<eos>: 61.01315486776085
You simply don’t knock against those kind
of women here.<eos>: 39.21952349577467
An exception here and there.<eos>: 16.6388716659895
Handsome yes, pretty in a
way you find but what I’m talking about is the female form.<eos>: 90.47263503629176
Besides
they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly
enhances a woman’s natural beauty, no matter what you say.<eos>: 79.3165467111203
Rumpled
stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it’s a
thing I simply hate to see.

Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the
others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog,
collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing.<eos>: 88.40964288106625
Shipahoy of course
had his own say to say.<eos>: 42.0535531158937
He had doubled the cape a few odd times and
weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all
those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him
or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.

So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt’s rock, wreck
of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for
the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry
Campbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand.<eos>: 85.85189333153203
That was the talk
of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of
original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish
_Times_), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore
in commotion petrified with horror.<eos>: 50.18911974739189
Then someone said something about
the case of the s.<eos>: 53.4749519796465
s.<eos>: 4.405906724215668
_Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_
which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with
all hands on deck.<eos>: 79.64922134273888
No aid was given.<eos>: 58.63649300100294
Her master, the _Mona_’s, said he
was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way.<eos>: 61.52441980214208
She had no water, it
appears, in her hold.

At this stage an incident happened.<eos>: 130.425780567055
It having become necessary for him
to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.

—Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just
gently dropping off into a peaceful doze.

He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door,
stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore
due left.<eos>: 79.2422971091878
While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who
noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship’s
rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his
burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew
and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig
out of it with a gurgling noise.<eos>: 55.71341174125328
The irrepressible Bloom, who also had
a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the
counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared
to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when
duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and
girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was
all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved.<eos>: 62.55526528912307
Some
person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by
the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a
brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor,
evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the
noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the
ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank.<eos>: 82.69134464083994
A hoof scooped
anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled.<eos>: 151.09965735802334
Slightly
disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of
the corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking
up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now
practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin
in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before
shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again
in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its
most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and
familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a
cool £ 100 a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass
proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of.<eos>: 111.37534077981964
And there he was at the
end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink
without a beggarly stiver.<eos>: 56.167738556404814
He drank needless to be told and it pointed
only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of
business if—a big if, however—he had contrived to cure himself of his
particular partiality.

All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping,
coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the
same thing.<eos>: 115.89654851772039
A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra
basin, the only launch that year.<eos>: 81.33612459145624
Right enough the harbours were there
only no ships ever called.

There were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently _au
fait_.

What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only
rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr
Worthington or some name like that, eh?<eos>: 107.68678506689436
Ask the then captain, he
advised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that
day’s work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.

—Am I right, skipper?<eos>: 85.18240354508863
he queried of the sailor, now returning after his
private potation and the rest of his exertions.

That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words
growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or
other in seconds or thirds.<eos>: 57.36708171748743
Mr Bloom’s sharp ears heard him then
expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have
lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and
making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in
question.<eos>: 87.78046378656582
Anyhow in he rolled after his successful
libation-_cum_-potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the
_soirée_, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook:

     —The biscuits was as hard as brass
     And the beef as salt as Lot’s wife’s arse.
     O, Johnny Lever!
     Johnny Lever, O!

After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene
and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form
provided.<eos>: 82.3064689771717
Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to
grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent
the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he
described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none
on the face of God’s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal
in large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every
year, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained
out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through
the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot
more surplus steam in the same vein.<eos>: 75.51600284348459
Their conversation accordingly
became general and all agreed that that was a fact.<eos>: 126.42494589057675
You could grow any
mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel
Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco.<eos>: 62.76429455041852
Where would you find
anywhere the like of Irish bacon?<eos>: 90.03929329181439
But a day of reckoning, he stated
_crescendo_ with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the
conversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of
pelf on account of her crimes.<eos>: 60.00389067222249
There would be a fall and the greatest
fall in history.<eos>: 62.59072308825495
The Germans and the Japs were going to have their
little lookin, he affirmed.<eos>: 19.027232471292564
The Boers were the beginning of the end.
Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be
Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the
vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at
once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the
tendon referred to on his boot.<eos>: 80.39995341383242
His advice to every Irishman was: stay
in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland.
Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.

Silence all round marked the termination of his _finale_.<eos>: 84.77136042804133
The
impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.

—Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a
bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.

To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper
concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.

—Who’s the best troops in the army?<eos>: 52.11322376857227
the grizzled old veteran irately
interrogated.<eos>: 7.375805784215175
And the best jumpers and racers?<eos>: 14.300002239310764
And the best admirals
and generals we’ve got?<eos>: 30.929938182723376
Tell me that.

—The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial
blemishes apart.

—That’s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated.<eos>: 25.740796902565062
The Irish catholic
peasant.<eos>: 37.90456358438347
He’s the backbone of our empire.<eos>: 11.420212887980261
You know Jem Mullins?

While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added
he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no
Irishman worthy of his salt that served it.<eos>: 173.4636277185677
Then they began to have a
few irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say,
appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with
interest so long as they didn’t indulge in recriminations and come to
blows.

From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was
rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for,
pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he
was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the
channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for,
rather concealed their strength than the opposite.<eos>: 73.5735743201855
It was quite on a
par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred
million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out
and if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all
he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of
contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it
was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both
countries even though poles apart.<eos>: 102.51359730926559
Another little interesting point,
the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance,
reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against
her, more so, in fact.<eos>: 112.99068845822649
And now, why?<eos>: 22.425448141115954
So the scene between the pair of
them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris,
the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him
forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing,
that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human
soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game.<eos>: 52.46353333641033
And as for the
lessee or keeper, who probably wasn’t the other person at all, he (B.)
couldn’t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people
like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and
refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private
life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a
Dannyman coming forward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like
Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated.<eos>: 113.2697214331273
Quite apart from
that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle.
Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his
bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it
(while inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for
a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage
of his political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a
party to any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of
the south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently,
after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with
the other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted
fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative
postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just
struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for
the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was
reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of
fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on.<eos>: 97.53427736976795
In any case
that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo
Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome.<eos>: 61.40245878111275
He ought
to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high.<eos>: 68.46576385037255
Like actresses,
always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again.
Generous to a fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any
idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow.<eos>: 87.25471169510114
So
similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid
of some £.<eos>: 146.30166651096658
s.<eos>: 4.405906724215668
d.<eos>: 5.129374379987754
in the course of his perambulations round the docks in
the congenial atmosphere of the _Old Ireland_ tavern, come back to Erin
and so on.<eos>: 21.568895287486892
Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the
same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually
silenced the offender.

—He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the
whole eventempered person declared, I let slip.<eos>: 87.27658087637413
He called me a jew and
in a heated fashion offensively.<eos>: 27.695361026584493
So I without deviating from plain
facts in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and
all his family like me though in reality I’m not.<eos>: 73.37200915347572
That was one for him.
A soft answer turns away wrath.<eos>: 58.69962082780299
He hadn’t a word to say for himself as
everyone saw.<eos>: 38.254397880634365
Am I not right?

He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride
at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to
glean in a kind of a way that it wasn’t all exactly.

—_Ex quibus_, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or
four eyes conversing, _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any
other, _secundum carnem_.

—Of course, Mr B.<eos>: 73.24962221595818
proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides
of the question.<eos>: 47.59035038102064
It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to
right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is
though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the
government it deserves.<eos>: 194.0676464730907
But with a little goodwill all round.<eos>: 30.6051153023073
It’s all
very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual
equality.<eos>: 42.609824607081976
I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form.<eos>: 28.617372956452844
It
never reaches anything or stops anything.<eos>: 89.51141114621579
A revolution must come on the
due instalments plan.<eos>: 46.285788299201926
It’s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate
people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular,
in the next house so to speak.

—Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes’ war, Stephen
assented, between Skinner’s alley and Ormond market.

Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that
was overwhelmingly right.<eos>: 76.13644141255675
And the whole world was full of that sort of
thing.

—You just took the words out of my mouth, he said.<eos>: 36.664168008643955
A hocuspocus of
conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn’t remotely...

All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad
blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind,
erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were
very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of
everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.

—They accuse, remarked he audibly.<eos>: 72.37590696359025
He turned away from the others, who
probably… and spoke nearer to, so as the others… in case they…

—Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen’s ear, are accused of
ruining.<eos>: 78.84106686457088
Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say.<eos>: 25.537438375677283
History, would
you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the
inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell,
an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer
for, imported them.<eos>: 74.37603300137492
Why?<eos>: 4.396144867849921
Because they are imbued with the proper
spirit.<eos>: 24.07927688161749
They are practical and are proved to be so.<eos>: 38.458603512179955
I don’t want to
indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and
then orthodox as you are.<eos>: 37.83637017098542
But in the economic, not touching religion,
domain the priest spells poverty.<eos>: 60.00225989726031
Spain again, you saw in the war,

Turks.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
It’s in the dogma.<eos>: 5.1059107524588825
Because if
they didn’t believe they’d go straight to heaven when they die they’d
try to live better, at least so I think.<eos>: 47.032100305090076
That’s the juggle on which the
p.p.’s raise the wind on false pretences.<eos>: 37.36328637848152
I’m, he resumed with dramatic
force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the
outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes
_pro rata_ having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion
either, something in the neighbourhood of £ 300 per annum.<eos>: 46.573159326738285
That’s the
vital issue at stake and it’s feasible and would be provocative of
friendlier intercourse between man and man.<eos>: 43.93380500470782
At least that’s my idea for
what it’s worth.<eos>: 30.805233463790152
I call that patriotism.<eos>: 10.74800948696336
_Ubi patria_, as we learned a
smattering of in our classical days in _Alma Mater, vita bene_.<eos>: 34.490265197457354
Where
you can live well, the sense is, if you work.

Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this
synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.
He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those
crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours
of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere
beneath or seemed to.<eos>: 95.70171875443452
Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or
didn’t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.

—Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.

The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person
who owned them pro tem.<eos>: 91.91002810450645
observed or rather his voice speaking did, all
must work, have to, together.

—I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest
possible sense.<eos>: 89.21216344736796
Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the
thing.<eos>: 43.8234782589927
Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel
nowadays.<eos>: 18.184834472516417
That’s work too.<eos>: 11.159755032958056
Important work.<eos>: 11.251684624536608
After all, from the little I
know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are
entitled to recoup yourself and command your price.<eos>: 73.87677232451105
You have every bit
as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the
peasant has.<eos>: 62.462555221363225
What?<eos>: 3.8546952873351206
You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.
Each is equally important.

—You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may
be important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called
Ireland for short.

—I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.

—But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important
because it belongs to me.

—What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under
some misapprehension.<eos>: 59.46056560531644
Excuse me.<eos>: 3.6002080795518188
Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the
latter portion.<eos>: 17.028296119767504
What was it you...?

Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of
coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding:

—We can’t change the country.<eos>: 62.1919041351163
Let us change the subject.

At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked
down but in a quandary, as he couldn’t tell exactly what construction
to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry.<eos>: 72.68501095087059
The rebuke of some
kind was clearer than the other part.<eos>: 30.50169319405891
Needless to say the fumes of his
recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way
foreign to his sober state.<eos>: 97.29456117192916
Probably the homelife to which Mr B
attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he
hadn’t been familiarised with the right sort of people.<eos>: 56.02085356025631
With a touch of
fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an
air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris,
the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister,
failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind
instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in
the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves.<eos>: 77.02767392599382
For
instance there was the case of O’Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy
faddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad
vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a
nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously
sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact).<eos>: 84.0944554099969
And then the usual
_dénouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed
into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a
strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so
as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law
amendment act, certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not
divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains.
Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly
turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and
the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in
the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne,
then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high
personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state,
he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running
counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before
under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good
Mrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the
reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women
chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being
largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it.<eos>: 105.70908143838817
Ladies who like
distinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must,
trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of
a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned
his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the
cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a
continental.<eos>: 78.09992469775457
However, reverting to the original, there were on the
other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest
rung by the aid of their bootstraps.<eos>: 44.07922841170042
Sheer force of natural genius,
that.<eos>: 80.76357959031616
With brains, sir.

For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even
to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could
not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad
having in fact let himself in for it.<eos>: 142.47767035531805
Still to cultivate the
acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food
for reflection would amply repay any small.<eos>: 114.9347869375672
Intellectual stimulation,
as such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the
mind.<eos>: 43.78267189939065
Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance,
row, old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers,
the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of
the world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth,
viz.<eos>: 95.24490743624953
coalminers, divers, scavengers etc., were very much under the
microscope lately.<eos>: 103.12673529020698
To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he
might meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy
if taken down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the
common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea
per column.<eos>: 154.4080459851924

Guesswork it
reduced itself to eventually.

—There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.

—Who?<eos>: 55.8134068704251
the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.

One morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read:

no-one to point a finger at him.<eos>: 135.35141342062929
Then they would all to a man have gone

senses.<eos>: 47.75191435192726
Dead he wasn’t.<eos>: 12.388182311402986

brought over was full of stones.<eos>: 125.75455520740994

He made a mistake to fight the priests.<eos>: 35.62203496289957
And so forth and
so on.

All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their
memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and
not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it
was twenty odd years.<eos>: 149.31317310778576
Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow
of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly
inadvisable, all things considered.<eos>: 67.3545427983633
Something evidently riled them in
his death.<eos>: 25.814936292002738
Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just
when his various different political arrangements were nearing
completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having
neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold
resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his
room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a
fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find
the job was taken out of their hands.<eos>: 88.18382534078546
Of course nobody being acquainted
with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his
whereabouts which were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order
even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and
Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within
the bounds of possibility.<eos>: 121.55378432408989
Naturally then it would prey on his mind as
a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure,
a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged
feet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren’t even a patch on
the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were
very few and far between.<eos>: 109.59921881625279
It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with
feet of clay, and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on
him with mutual mudslinging.<eos>: 53.67473705609008

understudy in the title _rôle_ how to.<eos>: 41.47891704253728
He saw him once on the
auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the _Insuppressible_
or was it _United Ireland_, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in
point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he
said _Thank you_, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid
exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the
cup and the lip: what’s bred in the bone.<eos>: 52.16386228512209
Still as regards return.<eos>: 85.1459711168254
You
were a lucky dog if they didn’t set the terrier at you directly you got
back.<eos>: 85.27711580565308
Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and
Harry against.<eos>: 140.7372851016176
And then, number one, you came up against the man in
possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the
Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, _Bella_ was the boat’s name to
the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence
went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew
was it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some
pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description
given, introduce himself with: _Excuse me, my name is So and So_ or
some such commonplace remark.<eos>: 74.91635996225959
A more prudent course, as Bloom said to
the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under
discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land
first.

—That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor
commented.<eos>: 106.8353674730738
She put the first nail in his coffin.

—Fine lump of a woman all the same, the _soi-disant_ townclerk Henry
Campbell remarked, and plenty of her.<eos>: 55.76437071970559
She loosened many a man’s thighs.
I seen her picture in a barber’s.<eos>: 37.28639007361335
The husband was a captain or an
officer.

—Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.

This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair
amount of laughter among his _entourage_.<eos>: 51.90141835977528
As regards Bloom he, without
the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the
door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused
extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters
worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed
between them full of sweet nothings.<eos>: 96.29928690189918
First it was strictly Platonic
till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till
bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of
the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not
a few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his
downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to
anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed
into.<eos>: 121.60672265764386
Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared
favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the
rank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared
her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went
through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape
of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a
particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment
with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained
admittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the
lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of.<eos>: 64.74598256601497
Whereas the
simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not
being up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the
name, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of
weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home
ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one’s smiles.<eos>: 81.05156806432335
The eternal
question of the life connubial, needless to say, cropped up.<eos>: 29.09287655868208
Can real
love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist
between married folk?<eos>: 121.40605435659714
Poser.<eos>: 2.6619012489209615
Though it was no concern of theirs
absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of
folly.<eos>: 67.55212391926972
A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented
obviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military
supernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday _farewell, my
gallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the 18th
hussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader,
that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course,
woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame
which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the
gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved
evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts
of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that
exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his
matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in
the same way as the fabled ass’s kick.<eos>: 60.862926738033
Looking back now in a
retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream.<eos>: 135.43005987905576
And then
coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without
saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the
times.<eos>: 166.60123956767418
Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not
been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as
it happened, he went to reside on the north side.<eos>: 71.58188342765595
North or south,
however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and
simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the
very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that
wouldn’t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting
every shred of decency to the winds.

—Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to
Stephen, about blood and the sun.<eos>: 79.97812972017839
And, if I don’t greatly mistake she
was Spanish too.

—The king of Spain’s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or
other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and
the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and
so many.

—Was she?<eos>: 62.64408581890193
Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any
means, I never heard that rumour before.<eos>: 74.32377391379117
Possible, especially there, it
was as she lived there.<eos>: 50.859213851762966
So, Spain.

Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him
by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out
his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained
rapidly finally he.

—Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded
photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?

Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large
sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she
was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously
low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than
vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth,
standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which
was _In Old Madrid_, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all
the vogue.<eos>: 108.61743493217563
Her (the lady’s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about
to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland
street, Dublin’s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the
esthetic execution.

—Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom
indicated.<eos>: 51.00713417719841
Taken a few years since.<eos>: 40.92021854053705
In or about ninety six.<eos>: 54.437086200046664
Very like
her then.

Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his
legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major
Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a
singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered
barely sweet sixteen.<eos>: 114.79832395931608
As for the face it was a speaking likeness in
expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a
lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage
in that getup.<eos>: 104.10074999837865
She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for
the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the.<eos>: 49.23134967671058
He dwelt,
being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in
general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that
afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as
works of art, in the National Museum.<eos>: 90.30910140762406
Marble could give the original,
shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest.<eos>: 60.72978197072852
Yes, puritanisme, it
does though, Saint Joseph’s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne
toi trop.<eos>: 26.238002186364312
Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn’t art in a
word.

The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar’s
good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to
speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the
beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in
itself which the camera could not at all do justice to.<eos>: 158.51818880161866
But it was
scarcely professional etiquette so.<eos>: 91.47132573413343
Though it was a warm pleasant sort
of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for
sunshine after storm.<eos>: 103.22864796996204
And he did feel a kind of need there and then to
follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by
moving a motion.<eos>: 147.16674870914275
Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly
soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear
however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further
increasing the other’s possible embarrassment while gauging her
symmetry of heaving _embonpoint_.<eos>: 183.02495911159386
In fact the slight soiling was only
an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new,
much better in fact with the starch out.<eos>: 171.26048303048762
Suppose she was gone when he?
I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely
as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning
littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses
(_sic_) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately
beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.

The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated,
_distingué_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of
the bunch though you wouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would.
Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it
was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter.<eos>: 88.2139750542891
And why not?<eos>: 28.6931210586178
An
awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a
lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same
old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or
the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about
the whole business.<eos>: 55.93707846723593
How they were fated to meet and an attachment
sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the
public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy
and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they
openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside
hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in
due course intimate.<eos>: 119.67018426062488
Then the decree _nisi_ and the King’s proctor
tries to show cause why and, he failing to quash it, _nisi_ was made
absolute.<eos>: 42.23611561428461
But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they
largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they
very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor
who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course.<eos>: 69.57095322310262
He, B,
enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin’s uncrowned king in the
flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen
leader’s, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when
clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader’s) trusty henchmen to the
number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated
into the printing works of the _Insuppressible_ or no it was _United
Ireland_ (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up
the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of
some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O’Brienite
scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile
tribune’s private morals.<eos>: 49.06209775446613
Though palpably a radically altered man he
was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with
that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the
shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that
their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which
she, however, was the first to perceive.<eos>: 106.93720750415767
As those were particularly hot
times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a
nasty prod of some chap’s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated
lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a
grave character.<eos>: 73.72303097019865
His hat (Parnell’s) a silk one was inadvertently
knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who
picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to
return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity)
who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat
at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the
country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos
of the thing than anything else, what’s bred in the bone instilled into
him in infancy at his mother’s knee in the shape of knowing what good
form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and
thanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you, sir_, though in
a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal
profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the
course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after
the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory
after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.

On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes
of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing
immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the
wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case
for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate
husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter
from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the
crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms,
drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a
domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord
and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not
receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would
overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes
though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as
quite possibly there were several others.<eos>: 86.07347019200758
He personally, being of a
sceptical bias, believed and didn’t make the smallest bones about
saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging
around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the
best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the
sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of
wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to
press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being
that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_
between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty
and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine
infatuation proved up to the hilt.

It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of
brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time
with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last
him his lifetime.<eos>: 101.45505850708187
In the nature of single blessedness he would one day
take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the
interim ladies’ society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the
gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump
Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular
lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as
to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl
courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to
their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of
complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers’ ways and
flowers and chocs.<eos>: 75.37664353293407
To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some
landlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age.<eos>: 50.81263674700297
The
queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who
was several years the other’s senior or like his father but something
substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made
on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty
Dumpty boiled.

—At what o’clock did you dine?<eos>: 96.98760188698142
he questioned of the slim form and tired
though unwrinkled face.

—Some time yesterday, Stephen said.

—Yesterday!<eos>: 54.43770825955439
exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow
Friday.<eos>: 72.03808783155763
Ah, you mean it’s after twelve!

—The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.

Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.
Though they didn’t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there
somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the
one train of thought.<eos>: 92.73762954574839
At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some
score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to
parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in
retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a
sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas.<eos>: 52.15939554046666
For instance when the
evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely
in people’s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a
copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which
wouldn’t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all
events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the
trend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his
mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted
with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he
at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he
strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion
by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan’s so that
he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of
mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him
(metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics
themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties
invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity
and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on
fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.

Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it
was, it was high time to be retiring for the night.<eos>: 83.48966396829866
The crux was it was
a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue
(somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash
altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed
unknown) with a lame paw (not that the cases were either identical or
the reverse though he had hurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he
very distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak.<eos>: 106.09458046352434
On the
other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount
or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which
of the two alternatives.<eos>: 88.18355122358781
Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved
him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things
considered.<eos>: 43.26742430376508
His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or
not over effusive but it grew on him someway.<eos>: 68.84840595827539
For one thing he mightn’t
what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried
him was he didn’t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly,
supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very
great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in
his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable.<eos>: 86.78111773932105
At all events he wound up
by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of
Epps’s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two
and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands
and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast
amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort
was kicked up.<eos>: 72.90237662756337
A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the
grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn’t
appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly
beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger’s bawdyhouse
of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would
be the best clue to that equivocal character’s whereabouts for a few
days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids’) with
sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to
freeze the marrow of anybody’s bones and mauling their largesized
charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment
of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for
as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as
Mr Algebra remarks _passim_.<eos>: 68.24855387866658
At the same time he inwardly chuckled over
his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being
a jew.<eos>: 44.761658176874064
People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what
properly riled them was a bite from a sheep.<eos>: 73.08255218089832
The most vulnerable point
too of tender Achilles.<eos>: 82.83890921833424
Your god was a jew.<eos>: 11.815382037986264
Because mostly they
appeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts
in the county Sligo.

—I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while
prudently pocketing her photo, as it’s rather stuffy here you just come
home with me and talk things over.<eos>: 91.26731005882336
My diggings are quite close in the
vicinity.<eos>: 28.090806508589484
You can’t drink that stuff.<eos>: 24.02812122168148
Do you like cocoa?<eos>: 32.244946497493395
Wait.<eos>: 2.366011761982759
I’ll
just pay this lot.

The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain
sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the
keeper of the shanty who didn’t seem to.

—Yes, that’s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of
that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.

All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (B’s) busy brain,
education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits,
up to date billing, concert tours in English watering resorts packed
with hydros and seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian
with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other
things, no necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from
the housetops about it, and a slice of luck.<eos>: 73.15267153656599
An opening was all was
wanted.<eos>: 189.03007066886767
Because he more than suspected he had his father’s voice to
bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be
just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the
direction of that particular red herring just to.

The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former
viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers’ association
dinner in London somewhere.<eos>: 70.74319752987591
Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this
thrilling announcement.<eos>: 48.22742131131497
Then the old specimen in the corner who
appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony
MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary’s lodge or words to
that effect.<eos>: 104.84493237375663
To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered
why.

—Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner
put in, manifesting some natural impatience.

—And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.

The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles
which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.

—Are you bad in the eyes?<eos>: 94.95009627277778
the sympathetic personage like the townclerk
queried.

—Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a
bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen
portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.
Sand in the Red Sea done that.<eos>: 71.19847807234451
One time I could read a book in the
dark, manner of speaking.<eos>: 53.36747254437902
_The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my
favourite and _Red as a Rose is She._

Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what,
found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a
hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which
time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied
loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched
him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were
sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions,
that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial
remark.

To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first
to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first
and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for
the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine
host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were
not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a
grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four
coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously
spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him
in unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well
worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.

—Come, he counselled to close the _séance_.

Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the
shelter or shanty together and the _élite_ society of oilskin and
company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their
_dolce far niente_.<eos>: 108.78095613267052
Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and
fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.

—One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of
the moment.<eos>: 49.123327157903006
Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs
upside down, on the tables in cafés.<eos>: 72.93687384194777
To which impromptu the
neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment’s hesitation, saying
straight off:

—To sweep the floor in the morning.

So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same
time apologetic to get on his companion’s right, a habit of his, by the
bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles.<eos>: 67.11688865776003
The
night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit
weak on his pins.

—It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a
moment.<eos>: 105.9568316200744
The only thing is to walk then you’ll feel a different man.
Come.<eos>: 71.38949669732868
It’s not far.<eos>: 11.382707562500963
Lean on me.

Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen’s right and led him on
accordingly.

—Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange
kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and
all that.

Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc.<eos>: 70.2471037709861
where the
municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and
purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming
of fresh fields and pastures new.<eos>: 60.22814624536161
And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the
analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the
part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the
time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the
selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.

So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which
Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made
tracks arm in arm across Beresford place.<eos>: 70.0486393633813
Wagnerian music, though
confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to
follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante’s _Huguenots_,
Meyerbeer’s _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart’s _Twelfth Mass_
he simply revelled in, the _Gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the
acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else
into a cocked hat.<eos>: 67.50661015540435
He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the
catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line
such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and I will live
thy protestant to be_.<eos>: 123.25008342467856
He also yielded to none in his admiration of
Rossini’s _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers,
in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable
sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and
putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers’ church
in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the
doors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather.<eos>: 66.16740404436676
There was the
unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it
to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was
a generally voiced desire for an encore.<eos>: 70.16076629903438
On the whole though favouring
preferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_,
a gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface
knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn.<eos>: 75.95952388569583
And
talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old
favourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel’s air in _Martha,
M’appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be
more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from
the lips of Stephen’s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of
the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat.
Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn’t sing it but
launched out into praises of Shakespeare’s songs, at least of in or
about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near
Gerard the herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an
instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch,
whom B.<eos>: 51.23065032010092
did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded
familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_
and _comes_ conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he
said, in the Queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one
Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.

On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond
the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground,
brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not
perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to
sixtyfive guineas and John Bull.<eos>: 81.8908367375496
He inquired if it was John Bull the
political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical
names, as a striking coincidence.

By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving,
Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other’s
sleeve gently, jocosely remarking:

—Our lives are in peril tonight.<eos>: 77.99890054347857
Beware of the steamroller.

They thereupon stopped.<eos>: 15.588671745777775
Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth
anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite
near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even
flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a
blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot
foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with
his thoughts.<eos>: 79.74367270082719
But such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn’t a lump
of sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared
for every emergency that might crop up.<eos>: 86.4505438856297
He was just a big nervous
foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world.<eos>: 48.320589337787816
But
even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan’s, of the
same size, would be a holy horror to face.<eos>: 67.89677918330423
But it was no animal’s fault
in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the
desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump.<eos>: 41.6246662931641
Nine tenths of them
all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring
the bees.<eos>: 63.76766313415619
Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of
his back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my
eagle eye.<eos>: 38.48628171795074
These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field
occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen’s words while the
ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly
interesting old.

—What’s this I was saying?<eos>: 69.16694396232499
Ah, yes!<eos>: 7.215819910660313
My wife, he intimated, plunging _in
medias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your
acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.

He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen,
image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome
blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after
as he was perhaps not that way built.

Still, supposing he had his father’s gift as he more than suspected, it
opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall’s Irish
industries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in
general.

Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has
End_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows
come from.<eos>: 66.09139946118016
Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_
about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men,
which boggled Bloom a bit:

     Von der Sirenen Listigkeit
     Tun die Poeten dichten.

These opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_.<eos>: 60.82263069865426
Bloom, nodding,
said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which
he did.

A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons,
which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could
easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice
production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the
bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and
procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into
fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial
magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his
university degree of B.<eos>: 104.88902862527122
A.<eos>: 10.782071472302787
(a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly
bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would
infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which
also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his
clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into
their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society’s sartorial
niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate
against you.<eos>: 118.63038817601345
It was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily
foresee him participating in their musical and artistic
_conversaziones_ during the festivities of the Christmas season, for
choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and
being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he
happened to know, were on record—in fact, without giving the show away,
he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have.<eos>: 86.65856589613543
Added
to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be
sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees.<eos>: 64.6049911983001
Not, he
parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily
embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of
time.<eos>: 52.15228398683343
But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and
both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity
in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a
cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped.<eos>: 121.31082879769828
Besides, though
taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that,
different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue
as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin’s musical world after the
usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public
by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_.<eos>: 65.32112816920359
Yes,
beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and
he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high
place in the city’s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and,
booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street
house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs,
so to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort
to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too
much fêted prince of good fellows.<eos>: 69.84379273031976
And it need not detract from the
other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time
to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing
without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything
derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone.<eos>: 72.07556383477926
In fact, he
had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other,
possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort,
hung on to him at all.

The horse was just then.<eos>: 87.4204156803828
And later on at a propitious opportunity he
purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on
the _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his
connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was
prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious
pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call
it which in Bloom’s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side
of a person’s character, no pun intended.

The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted
and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting
fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three
smoking globes of turds.<eos>: 74.12196153822428
Slowly three times, one after another, from a
full crupper he mired.<eos>: 59.8456300189676
And humanely his driver waited till he (or she)
had ended, patient in his scythed car.

Side by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed
through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping
over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower,
Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.

     Und alle Schiffe brücken.

The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely
watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black,
one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by
Father Maher_.<eos>: 97.80233549875535
As they walked they at times stopped and walked again
continuing their _tête à tête_ (which, of course, he was utterly out
of) about sirens, enemies of man’s reason, mingled with a number of
other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the
kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in
the sleeper car who in any case couldn’t possibly hear because they
were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner
street _and looked after their lowbacked car_.




[ 17 ]


What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?

Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they
followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and
Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left,
Gardiner’s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of
Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt,
bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place.
Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the
circus before George’s church diametrically, the chord in any circle
being less than the arc which it subtends.

Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?

Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman,
prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and
glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed
corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church,
ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers,
the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the
presabbath, Stephen’s collapse.

Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their
respective like and unlike reactions to experience?

Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to
plastic or pictorial.<eos>: 78.10973077139072
Both preferred a continental to an insular manner
of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence.<eos>: 34.90923966920443
Both
indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of
heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox
religious, national, social and ethical doctrines.<eos>: 33.75852507160926
Both admitted the
alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual
magnetism.

Were their views on some points divergent?

Stephen dissented openly from Bloom’s views on the importance of
dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen’s
views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature.
Bloom assented covertly to Stephen’s rectification of the anachronism
involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to
christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus,
son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign
of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt
(† 266 A.D.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty
and interred at Rossnaree.<eos>: 31.722596226088577
The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric
inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of
adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and
the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen
attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both
from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first
no bigger than a woman’s hand.

Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?

The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining
paraheliotropic trees.

Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in
the past?

In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public
thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard’s corner and
Leonard’s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield
avenue.<eos>: 55.650484717112434
In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the
wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of
Uppercross.<eos>: 43.46535095133404
In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and
prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class
railway carriages of suburban lines.<eos>: 68.79020634899565
In 1888 frequently with major
Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and
separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon’s house in Roundtown.<eos>: 64.06304242140469
Once
in 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both
occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom’s) house in Lombard street,
west.

What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885,
1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at
their destination?

He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual
development and experience was regressively accompanied by a
restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.

As in what ways?

From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received:
existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from
existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.

What act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?

At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers,
number 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back
pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.

Was it there?

It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on
the day but one preceding.

Why was he doubly irritated?

Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded
himself twice not to forget.

What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly
(respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?

To enter or not to enter.<eos>: 73.00151593043846
To knock or not to knock.

Bloom’s decision?

A stratagem.<eos>: 30.908749635336594
Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the
area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at
the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its
length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten
inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in
space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in
preparation for the impact of the fall.

Did he fall?

By his body’s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in
avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for
periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman,
pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast
of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year
one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era
five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand
three hundred and twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9,
dominical letters C B, Roman indiction 2, Julian period 6617, MCMIV.

Did he rise uninjured by concussion?

Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by
the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force
at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied
at its fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the
subadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free
inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame
which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit
finally a portable candle.

What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?

Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent
kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a
candle of 1 CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man
leaving the kitchen holding a candle.

Did the man reappear elsewhere?

After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible
through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the
halldoor.<eos>: 79.87091458104432
The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges.<eos>: 72.58447415740062
In the open
space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his
candle.

Did Stephen obey his sign?

Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and
followed softly along the hallway the man’s back and listed feet and
lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and
carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the
kitchen of Bloom’s house.

What did Bloom do?

He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its
flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for
Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when
necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid
resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons
of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs
Flower and M’Donald of 14 D’Olier street, kindled it at three
projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby
releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its
carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen
of the air.

Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?

Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two,
had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the
college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the
county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room
of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of
his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss
Julia Morkan at 15 Usher’s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie
(Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62 Clanbrassil
street: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of
number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of
Saint Francis Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the
physics’ theatre of university College, 16 Stephen’s Green, north: of
his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father’s house in Cabra.

What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from
the fire towards the opposite wall?

Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope,
stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the
chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs
folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of
ladies’ grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual
position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer
extremities and the third at their point of junction.

What did Bloom see on the range?

On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left
(larger) hob a black iron kettle.

What did Bloom do at the range?

He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron
kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to
let it flow.

Did it flow?

Yes.<eos>: 84.19102419977798
From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of
2400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of
filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial
plant cost of £ 5 per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen
of the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a
distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving
tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace
bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and
daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the
sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and
waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.<eos>: 45.31971459812821
E., on the instructions of
the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for
purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of
recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals
as in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding
their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch
meter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a
reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the
corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the
detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers,
solvent, sound.

What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier,
returning to the range, admire?

Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature
in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator’s
projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the
Pacific exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and
surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the
independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its
hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and
spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the
circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial
significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the
globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all
the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the
multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its
capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances
including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow
erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of
homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its
alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its
imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of
colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular
ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent
oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents,
gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in
seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies,
freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers,
cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts:
its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs
and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric
instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at
Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of
its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent
part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the
Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies,
inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing,
quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as
paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain,
sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms
in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls
and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries
and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its
docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric
power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in
canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its
potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling
from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic,
photophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the
globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90
% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine
% marshes,
pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning
moon.

Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he
return to the stillflowing tap?

To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of
Barrington’s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought
thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh
cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in
a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.

What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom’s offer?

That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by
submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the
month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous
substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and
language.

What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and
prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a
preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with
rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region
in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most
sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?

The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.

What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?

Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric
energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the
lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.

Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?

Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and
recuperation.

What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the
agency of fire?

The phenomenon of ebullition.<eos>: 33.5265665990428
Fanned by a constant updraught of
ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was
communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral
masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the
foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn
derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat
(radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous
ether.<eos>: 25.1077091958543
Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion,
was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of
calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated
through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part
reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the
temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in
temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal
units needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50° to 212° Fahrenheit.

What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?

A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at
both sides simultaneously.

For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?

To shave himself.

What advantages attended shaving by night?

A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from
shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if
unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at
incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a
cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal
noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a
postman’s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering,
relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he
sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving
and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected
and applied adhered: which was to be done.

Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?

Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine
feminine passive active hand.

What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting
influence?

The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human
blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their
natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic
surgery.

What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the
kitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?

On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal
breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a
moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white
goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly
copper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits.<eos>: 74.36344841739785
On the middle shelf a
chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four
conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of
Plumtree’s potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and
containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and
Co’s white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink
tissue paper, a packet of Epps’s soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne
Lynch’s choice tea at 2/- per lb in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a
cylindrical canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two
onions, one, the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish,
bisected with augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model
Dairy’s cream, a jug of brown crockery containing a naggin and a
quarter of soured adulterated milk, converted by heat into water,
acidulous serum and semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity
subtracted for Mr Bloom’s and Mrs Fleming’s breakfasts, made one
imperial pint, the total quantity originally delivered, two cloves, a
halfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak.<eos>: 66.14609927991174
On the
upper shelf a battery of jamjars (empty) of various sizes and
proveniences.

What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?

Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets,
numbered 8 87, 88 6.

What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?

Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction,
preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official
and definitive result of which he had read in the _Evening Telegraph_,
late pink edition, in the cabman’s shelter, at Butt bridge.

Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected,
been received by him?

In Bernard Kiernan’s licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 little Britain
street: in David Byrne’s licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in
O’Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon’s when a dark man had
placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising
Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the
premises of F.<eos>: 69.53869367327725
W.<eos>: 1.343769496026818
Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when,
when Frederick M.<eos>: 59.862112186375285
(Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively
requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the
_Freeman’s Journal_ and _National Press_ which he had been about to
throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the
oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street,
with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in
his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.

What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?

The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event
followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the
electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by
failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding
originally from a successful interpretation.

His mood?

He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he
was satisfied.

What satisfied him?

To have sustained no positive loss.<eos>: 57.411429257209036
To have brought a positive gain to
others.<eos>: 48.36981311424876
Light to the gentiles.

How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?

He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps’s
soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed
on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the
prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity
prescribed.

What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his
guest?

Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation
Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly),
he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served
extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the
viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion
(Molly).

Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of
hospitality?

His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he
accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps’s
massproduct, the creature cocoa.

Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed,
reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to
complete the act begun?

The reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right
side of his guest’s jacket.<eos>: 81.48402962034453
A gift to his guest of one of the four
lady’s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable
condition.

Who drank more quickly?

Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and
taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a
steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent’s one,
six to two, nine to three.

What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?

Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was
engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived
from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself
had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the
solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.

Had he found their solution?

In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages,
aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text,
the answers not bearing in all points.

What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him,
potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the
offering of three prizes of 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively for
competition by the _Shamrock_, a weekly newspaper?

     An ambition to squint
     At my verses in print
     Makes me hope that for these you’ll find room.
     If you so condescend
     Then please place at the end
     The name of yours truly, L.<eos>: 101.17051057076651
Bloom.

Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?

Name, age, race, creed.

What anagrams had he made on his name in youth?

Leopold Bloom
Ellpodbomool
Molldopeloob
Bollopedoom
Old Ollebo, M.<eos>: 87.00110771812004
P.

What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic
poet) sent to Miss Marion (Molly) Tweedy on the 14 February 1888?

     Poets oft have sung in rhyme
     Of music sweet their praise divine.
     Let them hymn it nine times nine.
     Dearer far than song or wine.
     You are mine.<eos>: 181.68890824245045
The world is mine.

What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R.<eos>: 75.24512867696126
G.
Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years,
entitled _If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now_,
commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48,
49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the
valley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the
grand annual Christmas pantomime _Sinbad the Sailor_ (produced by R.
Shelton 26 December 1892, written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by
George A.<eos>: 54.348084996910714
Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan
under the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie
Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist,
principal girl?

Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest,
the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded
1837) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market:
secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the
questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the duke
and duchess of York (real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru
(imaginary): thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and
professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand
Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street:
fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist’s
non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical expression of countenance
and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist’s revelations of white
articles of non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing
while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the
difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous
allusions from _Everybody’s Book of Jokes_ (1000 pages and a laugh in
every one): sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous,
associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new
high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket
Barton.

What relation existed between their ages?

16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen’s present age Stephen
was 6.<eos>: 53.27258247174542
16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom’s present
age Bloom would be 54.<eos>: 64.84981123996842
In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54
their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13
1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according
as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in
1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then
1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen
would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when
Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom,
being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have
surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of
Methusalah, 969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until
he would attain that age in the year 3072 A.D., Bloom would have been
obliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have
been born in the year 81,396 B.C.

What events might nullify these calculations?

The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new
era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent
extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.

How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?

Two.<eos>: 62.94450848326445
The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon’s house, Medina
Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen’s
mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his
hand in salutation.<eos>: 34.84171521609847
The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin’s hotel on
a rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen’s
father and Stephen’s granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older.

Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and
afterwards seconded by the father?

Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative
gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.

Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a
third connecting link between them?

Mrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the
house of Stephen’s parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891
and had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City
Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O’Dowd of 54 Prussia street where, during
parts of the years 1893 and 1894, she had been a constant informant of
Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in
the employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence
of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular
road.

Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?

He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow
of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with
slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North
Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low’s place of business where she had
remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular
fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles
equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems,
private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from
the city to the Phoenix Park and _vice versa_.

Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?

Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of
bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with
continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds,
velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round
and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.

What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years
deceased?

The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her
suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient
catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the
statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for
Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.

Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation
which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the
more desirable?

The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently
abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow’s _Physical Strength and How to
Obtain It_ which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in
sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in
front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of
muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant
relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.

Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?

Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full
circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had
excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever
movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally
developed abdominal muscles.

Did either openly allude to their racial difference?

Neither.

What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom’s thoughts
about Stephen’s thoughts about Bloom and about Stephen’s thoughts about
Bloom’s thoughts about Stephen?

He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he
knew that he knew that he was not.

What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective
parentages?

Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag
(subsequently Rudolph Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan,
London and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius
Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty).<eos>: 57.726398892518404
Stephen, eldest
surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin
and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).

Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or
layman?

Bloom (three times), by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M.<eos>: 72.53918949844747
A., alone,
in the protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe, by James
O’Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump
in the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C.<eos>: 58.914351834576436
C., in
the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.<eos>: 24.782537562176064
Stephen (once) by the
reverend Charles Malone C.<eos>: 42.78423087970033
C., alone, in the church of the Three
Patrons, Rathgar.

Did they find their educational careers similar?

Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively
through a dame’s school and the high school.<eos>: 67.96098366146312
Substituting Bloom for
Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory,
junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the
matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the
royal university.

Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the
university of life?

Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation
had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to
him.

What two temperaments did they individually represent?

The scientific.<eos>: 64.883879967912
The artistic.

What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards
applied, rather than towards pure, science?

Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in
a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his
appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once
revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting
telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water
siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.

Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of
kindergarten?

Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard,
catapults.<eos>: 47.989603579037684
They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the
twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature
mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to
correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls,
historically costumed dolls.

What also stimulated him in his cogitations?

The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A.<eos>: 26.302947393898982
James,
the former by his 1d bazaar at 42 George’s street, south, the latter at
his 6 1/2d shop and world’s fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30
Henry street, admission 2d, children 1d: and the infinite possibilities
hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in
triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility
(divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of
magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to
convince, to decide.

Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that
originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably
conduce to success?

His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn
by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be
seated engaged in writing.

Queen’s Ho...

What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?

The Queen’s Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf
Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated,
in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered
in the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of 2 parts of aconite
liniment to 1 of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m.<eos>: 62.171471900382755
on
the morning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17
Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of
having, purchased at 3.15 p.m.<eos>: 85.01005065879276
on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new
boater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence
of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin
aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main
street, Ennis.

Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or
intuition?

Coincidence.

Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?

He preferred himself to see another’s face and listen to another’s
words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament
relieved.

Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to
him, described by the narrator as _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The
Parable of the Plums_?

It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by
implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms
(e.g.<eos>: 68.8566969291985
_My Favourite Hero_ or _Procrastination is the Thief of Time_)
composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in
conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of
financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially
collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent
merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or
contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy
or Doctor Dick or Heblon’s _Studies in Blue_, to a publication of
certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual
stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of
successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful
achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following
the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday,
21 June (S.<eos>: 70.20889809974312
Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise 3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m.

Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other
frequently engaged his mind?

What to do with our wives.

What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?

Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball,
nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts,
chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the
policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar,
piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope
addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial
activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress
proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine
satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state
inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular
infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive
superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised
respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction
specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.

What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him
in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?

In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper
with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and
Hebrew characters.<eos>: 78.81168612336656
She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals
as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of
a city in Canada, Quebec.<eos>: 75.64639104834569
She understood little of political
complications, internal, or balance of power, external.<eos>: 98.10483797549222
In calculating
the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid.<eos>: 33.799964335120045
After
completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the
implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the
corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall.<eos>: 17.819227931005052
Unusual
polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by
false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), _alias_
(a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).

What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and
such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?

The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all
balances, proved true by construction.<eos>: 85.04699592765047
The counterbalance of her
proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by
experiment.

How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?

Variously.<eos>: 46.57062214762477
By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a
certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent
knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other’s
ignorant lapse.

With what success had he attempted direct instruction?

She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest
comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty
remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated
with error.

What system had proved more effective?

Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest.

Example?

She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she
disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new
hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.

Accepting the analogy implied in his guest’s parable which examples of
postexilic eminence did he adduce?

Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides,
author of _More Nebukim_ (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn
of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn)
there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).

What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth
seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by
Stephen?

That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher,
name uncertain.

Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a
selected or rejected race mentioned?

Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher),
Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).

What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish
languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts
by guest to host and by host to guest?

By Stephen: _suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin_
(walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).

By Bloom: _Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m’baad l’zamatejch_ (thy temple
amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).

How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages
made in substantiation of the oral comparison?

By juxtaposition.<eos>: 80.18588885862401
On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior
literary style, entituled _Sweets of Sin_ (produced by Bloom and so
manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of
the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish
characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn
wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence
of mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as
ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1, 4, and 100.

Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the
extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?

Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence
and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.

What points of contact existed between these languages and between the
peoples who spoke them?

The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and
servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been
taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the
seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor
of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland:
their archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical,
homiletic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures
comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and
Ghemara), Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote,
Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival
and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical
rites in ghetto (S.<eos>: 34.208288967160016
Mary’s Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve’s
tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and
jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the
possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.

What anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple,
ethnically irreducible consummation?

     Kolod balejwaw pnimah
     Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.

Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?

In consequence of defective mnemotechnic.

How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?

By a periphrastic version of the general text.

In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?

The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic
hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of
modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions
(Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).

Did the guest comply with his host’s request?

Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.

What was Stephen’s auditive sensation?

He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation
of the past.

What was Bloom’s visual sensation?

He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a
future.

What were Stephen’s and Bloom’s quasisimultaneous volitional
quasisensations of concealed identities?

Visually, Stephen’s: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by
Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as
leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.

Auditively, Bloom’s: The traditional accent of the ecstasy of
catastrophe.

What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with
what exemplars?

In the church, Roman, Anglican or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very
reverend John Conmee S.<eos>: 37.99847440543826
J., the reverend T.<eos>: 34.36716054575633

On the stage,

Osmond Tearle († 1901), exponent of Shakespeare.

Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a
strange legend on an allied theme?

Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being
secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid
residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream
plus cocoa, having been consumed.

Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.

     Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all
     Went out for to play ball.
     And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played
     He drove it o’er the jew’s garden wall.
     And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played
     He broke the jew’s windows all.

[Illustration]

How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?

With unmixed feeling.<eos>: 87.76781132476317
Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw
the unbroken kitchen window.

Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.

     Then out there came the jew’s daughter
     And she all dressed in green.
     “Come back, come back, you pretty little boy,
     And play your ball again.”
     
     I can’t come back and I won’t come back
     Without my schoolfellows all.
     For if my master he did hear
     He’d make it a sorry ball.”

     She took him by the lilywhite hand
     And led him along the hall
     Until she led him to a room
     Where none could hear him call.

     She took a penknife out of her pocket
     And cut off his little head.
     And now he’ll play his ball no more
     For he lies among the dead.

[Illustration]

How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?

With mixed feelings.<eos>: 91.66199349901835
Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew’s
daughter, all dressed in green.

Condense Stephen’s commentary.

One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined.<eos>: 45.33823250672501
Once by
inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny.<eos>: 65.75371069598069
It comes when
he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of
hope and youth, holds him unresisting.<eos>: 97.21721301539742
It leads him to a strange
habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable,
immolates him, consenting.

Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?

He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him
should by him not be told.

Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?

In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.

Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?

He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the
incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the
propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of
opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of
atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism,
hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.

From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not
totally immune?

From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his
sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an
indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds.<eos>: 65.69662730932777
From
somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled
in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its
destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain,
sleeping.

Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member
of his family?

Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent
(Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an
exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two
figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.

What other infantile memories had he of her?

15 June 1889.<eos>: 68.36829548708461
A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and
lessen congestion.<eos>: 55.53913661090243
A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks
her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo,
tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark,
she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau,
Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British
navy.

What endemic characteristics were present?

Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line
of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant
intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.

What memories had he of her adolescence?

She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess.<eos>: 61.42507687430577
On the duke’s
lawn, entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to
make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated).<eos>: 63.314074341038655
On
the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an
individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and
turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated).<eos>: 113.88055285807557
On the vigil of the
15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county
Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year
not stated).

Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?

Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.

What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly,
if differently?

A temporary departure of his cat.

Why similarly, why differently?

Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male
(Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian).<eos>: 104.47140793417313
Differently,
because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the
habitation.

In other respects were their differences similar?

In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in
unexpectedness.

As?

Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it
for her (cf neckarching cat).<eos>: 100.65603967324239
Moreover, on the free surface of the lake
in Stephen’s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented
spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the
constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf
mousewatching cat).<eos>: 43.27451433654013
Again, in order to remember the date, combatants,
issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a
plait of her hair (cf earwashing cat).<eos>: 54.58830827983209
Furthermore, silly Milly, she
dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a
horse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a
tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf
hearthdreaming cat).<eos>: 91.91697422210503
Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct
of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.

In what way had he utilised gifts (1) an owl, 2) a clock, given as
matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?

As object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous
animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of
vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the
pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation
in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of
clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of
the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and
the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination,
_videlicet_, 5 5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical
progression.

In what manners did she reciprocate?

She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to
him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware.
She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had
been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his
necessities, anticipating his desires.<eos>: 48.99790531086714
She admired: a natural
phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the
immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of
his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.

What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist,
make to Stephen, noctambulist?

To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and
Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately
above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of
his host and hostess.

What various advantages would or might have resulted from a
prolongation of such an extemporisation?

For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study.<eos>: 87.6556494495845
For the
host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction.<eos>: 34.269222791832206
For the
hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian
pronunciation.

Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a
hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent
eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew’s
daughter?

Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother
through daughter.

To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest
return a monosyllabic negative answer?

If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at
Sydney Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.

What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the
host?

A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment
of Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), 26 June 1903, vigil of the
anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).

Was the proposal of asylum accepted?

Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.

What exchange of money took place between host and guest?

The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (£
1-7-0), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to
the former.

What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified,
declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?

To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the
residence of the instructed.<eos>: 65.957819688353
To inaugurate a course of vocal
instruction, place the residence of the instructress.<eos>: 32.006974808197185
To inaugurate a
series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues,
places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident
in the same place), the _Ship_ hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street
(W.<eos>: 45.173167024408066
and E.<eos>: 12.854379014689021
Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10
Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles
street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a
conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection
of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were
resident in different places, fuck everyone who is reading this shit).

What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually
selfexcluding propositions?

The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert
Hengler’s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive
particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring
to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had
publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his
(the clown’s) papa.<eos>: 58.99881557518279
The imprevidibility of the future: once in the
summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches
on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and
received by J.<eos>: 67.17094296971553
and T.<eos>: 10.296821649816481
Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand
Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible,
circuitous or direct, return.

Was the clown Bloom’s son?

No.

Had Bloom’s coin returned?

Never.

Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?

Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to
amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and
international animosity.

He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible,
eliminating these conditions?

There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct
from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of
destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of
the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and
death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human
females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable
accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies
and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital
criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make
terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres
of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital
growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through
maturity to decay.

Why did he desist from speculation?

Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other
more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena
to be removed.

Did Stephen participate in his dejection?

He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding
syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational
reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon
the incertitude of the void.

Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?

Not verbally.<eos>: 48.129208919628425
Substantially.

What comforted his misapprehension?

That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from
the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.

In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the
exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation
effected?

Lighted Candle in Stick borne by
BLOOM
Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by
STEPHEN

With what intonation _secreto_ of what commemorative psalm?

The 113th, _modus peregrinus: In exitu Israël de Egypto: domus Jacob de
populo barbaro_.

What did each do at the door of egress?

Bloom set the candlestick on the floor.<eos>: 81.20151359414066
Stephen put the hat on his
head.

For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?

For a cat.

What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the
guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from
the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?

The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.

With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his
companion of various constellations?

Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in
incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous
scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an
observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000
ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of
Sirius (alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles)
distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of
Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and
sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could
be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in
1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of
the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality
evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote
futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of
allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.

Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?

Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of
the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences
concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives
and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the
incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible
molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single
pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white
bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other
bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies
of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component
bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division
till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never
reached.

Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?

Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of
the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a
number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such
magnitude and of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power
of 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes
of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would
have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its
printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of
thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds
of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of
every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to
the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.

Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their
satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and
moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?

Of a different order of difficulty.<eos>: 51.76748667688268
Conscious that the human organism,
normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when
elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere
suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the
line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was
approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo,
when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a
working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more
adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might
subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian,
Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an
apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite
differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would
probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to
vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.

And the problem of possible redemption?

The minor was proved by the major.

Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?

The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white,
yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy:
their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions:
the waggoner’s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular
cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the
interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous
discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel,
Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of
distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite
compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive
and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin
of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the
birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric
showers about the period of the feast of S.<eos>: 37.29112060910927
Lawrence (martyr, 10
August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon
in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the
appearance of a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating
by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and
amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the
period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent
neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude)
of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and
disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about
the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of
(presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably)
appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about
the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the
constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph
Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before
or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena
of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of
wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of
nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light,
obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.

His (Bloom’s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and
allowing for possible error?

That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not
a heavenman.<eos>: 60.265004968754454
That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the
known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the
suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and
of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in
space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as
a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present
existence.

Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?

Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the
delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection
invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the
satellite of their planet.

Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological
influences upon sublunary disasters?

It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the
nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to
verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the
sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.

What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and
woman?

Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian
generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her
luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and
setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced
invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to
inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent
waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to
render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil
inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant
implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm:
the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the
admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour,
when visible: her attraction, when invisible.

What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom’s, who attracted Stephen’s,
gaze?

In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom’s) house the light of a
paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller
blind supplied by Frank O’Hara, window blind, curtain pole and
revolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street.

How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his
wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?

With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued
affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with
suggestion.

Both then were silent?

Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal
flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.

Were they indefinitely inactive?

At Stephen’s suggestion, at Bloom’s instigation both, first Stephen,
then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs
of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual
circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom’s, then Stephen’s, elevated to
the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.

Similarly?

The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations
were dissimilar: Bloom’s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form
of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate
year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of
greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the
institution, 210 scholars: Stephen’s higher, more sibilant, who in the
ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic
consumption an insistent vesical pressure.

What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the
invisible audible collateral organ of the other?

To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity,
reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.

To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus
circumcised (1 January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain
from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine
prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic
church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of
the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine
excrescences as hair and toenails.

What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?

A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament
from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the
Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.

How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal
departer?

By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an
unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and
turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its
staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and
revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.

How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?

Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its
base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and
forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.

What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of
their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?

The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the
bells in the church of Saint George.

What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?

By Stephen:

     Liliata rutilantium.<eos>: 48.24775594441547
Turma circumdet.
     Iubilantium te virginum.<eos>: 5.118364508302143
Chorus excipiat.

By Bloom:

     Heigho, heigho,
     Heigho, heigho.

Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day
at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south
to Glasnevin in the north?

Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in
bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed),
John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in
bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).

Alone, what did Bloom hear?

The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth,
the double vibration of a jew’s harp in the resonant lane.

Alone, what did Bloom feel?

The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing
point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the
incipient intimations of proximate dawn.

Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind
him?

Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy
Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis,
Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F.<eos>: 56.99721320702992
Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin
Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart
(phthisis, Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy,
Sandymount).

What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?

The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the
apparition of a new solar disk.

Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?

Once, in 1887, after a protracted performance of charades in the house
of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of
the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the
direction of Mizrach, the east.

He remembered the initial paraphenomena?

More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at
various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer,
the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the
first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.

Did he remain?

With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering
the passage, reclosing the door.<eos>: 55.66607005404272
With brief suspiration he reassumed
the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front
room, hallfloor, and reentered.

What suddenly arrested his ingress?

The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into
contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible
fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in
consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.

Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of
furniture.

A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite
the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an
alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and
white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the
door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard
(a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had
been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but
more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved
from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally
occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.

Describe them.

One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back
slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an
irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply
upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing
discolouration.<eos>: 58.46716613353835
The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane
curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat
and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a
bright circle of white plaited rush.

What significances attached to these two chairs?

Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of
circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.

What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?

A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin
supporting a pair of long yellow ladies’ gloves and an emerald ashtray
containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two
discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in
the key of G natural for voice and piano of _Love’s Old Sweet Song_
(words by G.<eos>: 132.94573768241904
Clifton Bingham, composed by J.<eos>: 20.27729253928721
L.<eos>: 1.7901774154014805
Molloy, sung by Madam
Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications
_ad libitum, forte_, pedal, _animato_, sustained pedal, _ritirando_,
close.

With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?

With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right
temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a
large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation,
bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement,
remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan’s scheme of colour containing the
gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent
act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the
consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual
discolouration.

His next proceeding?

From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black
diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on
a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the
mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus
(illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it
superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the
candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the
latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin
of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to
facilitate total combustion.

What followed this operation?

The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a
vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.

What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the
mantelpiece?

A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46
a.m.<eos>: 69.71937432076348
on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf
tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial
gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of
Alderman John Hooper.

What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and
Bloom?

In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the
dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl.<eos>: 71.97730017500768
Before the
mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear
melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom
while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated
gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.

What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his
attention?

The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.

Why solitary (ipsorelative)?

     Brothers and sisters had he none.
     Yet that man’s father was his grandfather’s son.

Why mutable (aliorelative)?

From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix.
From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal
procreator.

What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?

The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged
and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles
on the two bookshelves opposite.

What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of
the inverted volumes?

The necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its
place: the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females:
the incongruity of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella
inclined in a closestool: the insecurity of hiding any secret document
behind, beneath or between the pages of a book.

Which volume was the largest in bulk?

Hozier’s _History of the Russo-Turkish War._

What among other data did the second volume of the work in question
contain?

The name of a decisive battle (forgotten), frequently remembered by a
decisive officer, major Brian Cooper Tweedy (remembered).

Why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question?

Firstly, in order to exercise mnemotechnic: secondly, because after an
interval of amnesia, when, seated at the central table, about to
consult the work in question, he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of
the military engagement, Plevna.

What caused him consolation in his sitting posture?

The candour, nudity, pose, tranquility, youth, grace, sex, counsel of a
statue erect in the centre of the table, an image of Narcissus
purchased by auction from P.<eos>: 52.48676033072296
A.<eos>: 10.782071472302787
Wren, 9 Bachelor’s Walk.

What caused him irritation in his sitting posture?

Inhibitory pressure of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two
articles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and
inelastic to alterations of mass by expansion.

How was the irritation allayed?

He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible
stud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table.<eos>: 57.18600261523143
He
unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers,
shirt and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black
hairs extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over
the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the
medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral
vertebrae, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in
circles described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the
summits of the mammary prominences.<eos>: 37.66034502098456
He unbraced successively each of
six minus one braced trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one
incomplete.

What involuntary actions followed?

He compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice
in the left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a
sting inflicted 2 weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee.
He scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of
prurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly
abluted skin.<eos>: 97.40397549610692
He inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of
his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (1 shilling),
placed there (presumably) on the occasion (17 October 1903) of the
interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.

Did the process of divestiture continue?

Did the process of divestiture continue?

Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended
his foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and
salient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking
repeatedly in several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded
the laceknots, unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his
two boots for the second time, detached the partially moistened right
sock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again
effracted, raised his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic
sock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right
foot on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently
lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part
lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick, then,
with satisfaction, threw away the lacerated ungual fragment.

Why with satisfaction?

Because the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other
ungual fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs
Ellis’s juvenile school, patiently each night in the act of brief
genuflection and nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation.

In what ultimate ambition had all concurrent and consecutive ambitions
now coalesced?

Not to inherit by right of primogeniture, gavelkind or borough English,
or possess in perpetuity an extensive demesne of a sufficient number of
acres, roods and perches, statute land measure (valuation £ 42), of

gable, rising, if possible, upon a gentle eminence with agreeable
prospect from balcony with stone pillar parapet over unoccupied and
unoccupyable interjacent pastures and standing in 5 or 6 acres of its
own ground, at such a distance from the nearest public thoroughfare as
to render its houselights visible at night above and through a quickset
hornbeam hedge of topiary cutting, situate at a given point not less
than 1 statute mile from the periphery of the metropolis, within a time
limit of not more than 15 minutes from tram or train line (e.g.,

Saint Leopold’s.<eos>: 8.413424059271076
Flowerville.

Could Bloom of 7 Eccles street foresee Bloom of Flowerville?

In loose allwool garments with Harris tweed cap, price 8/6, and useful
garden boots with elastic gussets and wateringcan, planting aligned
young firtrees, syringing, pruning, staking, sowing hayseed, trundling
a weedladen wheelbarrow without excessive fatigue at sunset amid the
scent of newmown hay, ameliorating the soil, multiplying wisdom,
achieving longevity.

What syllabus of intellectual pursuits was simultaneously possible?

Snapshot photography, comparative study of religions, folklore relative
to various amatory and superstitious practices, contemplation of the
celestial constellations.

What lighter recreations?

Outdoor: garden and fieldwork, cycling on level macadamised causeways,

unmolested river boating in secure wherry or light curricle with kedge
anchor on reaches free from weirs and rapids (period of estivation),
vespertinal perambulation or equestrian circumprocession with
inspection of sterile landscape and contrastingly agreeable cottagers’
fires of smoking peat turves (period of hibernation).<eos>: 35.68470043184986
Indoor:
discussion in tepid security of unsolved historical and criminal
problems: lecture of unexpurgated exotic erotic masterpieces: house
carpentry with toolbox containing hammer, awl, nails, screws, tintacks,
gimlet, tweezers, bullnose plane and turnscrew.

Might he become a gentleman farmer of field produce and live stock?

Not impossibly, with 1 or 2 stripper cows, 1 pike of upland hay and
requisite farming implements, e.g., an end-to-end churn, a turnip
pulper etc.

What would be his civic functions and social status among the county
families and landed gentry?

Arranged successively in ascending powers of hierarchical order, that
of gardener, groundsman, cultivator, breeder, and at the zenith of his
career, resident magistrate or justice of the peace with a family crest
and coat of arms and appropriate classical motto _(Semper paratus_),
duly recorded in the court directory (Bloom, Leopold P., M.<eos>: 57.91871268981982

in court and fashionable intelligence (Mr and Mrs Leopold Bloom have
left Kingstown for England).

What course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity?

A course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour: the
dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes,
incessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social
inequality, of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice, tempered
with mitigants of the widest possible latitude but exactable to the
uttermost farthing with confiscation of estate, real and personal, to
the crown.<eos>: 51.34928411184395
Loyal to the highest constituted power in the land, actuated
by an innate love of rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance
of public order, the repression of many abuses though not of all
simultaneously (every measure of reform or retrenchment being a
preliminary solution to be contained by fluxion in the final solution),
the upholding of the letter of the law (common, statute and law
merchant) against all traversers in covin and trespassers acting in
contravention of bylaws and regulations, all resuscitators (by trespass
and petty larceny of kindlings) of venville rights, obsolete by
desuetude, all orotund instigators of international persecution, all
perpetuators of international animosities, all menial molestors of
domestic conviviality, all recalcitrant violators of domestic
connubiality.

Prove that he had loved rectitude from his earliest youth.

To Master Percy Apjohn at High School in 1880 he had divulged his
disbelief in the tenets of the Irish (protestant) church (to which his
father Rudolf Virag (later Rudolph Bloom) had been converted from the
Israelitic faith and communion in 1865 by the Society for promoting
Christianity among the jews) subsequently abjured by him in favour of
Roman catholicism at the epoch of and with a view to his matrimony in
1888.<eos>: 42.22105913457517
To Daniel Magrane and Francis Wade in 1882 during a juvenile
friendship (terminated by the premature emigration of the former) he
had advocated during nocturnal perambulations the political theory of
colonial (e.g.<eos>: 50.460365337119875
Canadian) expansion and the evolutionary theories of
Charles Darwin, expounded in _The Descent of Man_ and _The Origin of
Species_.<eos>: 16.50952807890655
In 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence to the
collective and national economic programme advocated by James Fintan
Lalor, John Fisher Murray, John Mitchel, J.<eos>: 31.749276733560855

B.) and, in support of his political convictions, had
climbed up into a secure position amid the ramifications of a tree on
Northumberland road to see the entrance (2 February 1888) into the
capital of a demonstrative torchlight procession of 20,000
torchbearers, divided into 120 trade corporations, bearing 2000 torches
in escort of the marquess of Ripon and (honest) John Morley.

How much and how did he propose to pay for this country residence?

As per prospectus of the Industrious Foreign Acclimatised Nationalised
Friendly Stateaided Building Society (incorporated 1874), a maximum of
£ 60 per annum, being 1/6 of an assured income, derived from giltedged
securities, representing at 5 % simple interest on capital of £ 1200
(estimate of price at 20 years’ purchase), of which 1/3 to be paid on
acquisition and the balance in the form of annual rent, viz.<eos>: 72.61408830205738
£ 800 plus
2 1/2 % interest on the same, repayable quarterly in equal annual
instalments until extinction by amortisation of loan advanced for
purchase within a period of 20 years, amounting to an annual rental of
£ 64, headrent included, the titledeeds to remain in possession of the
lender or lenders with a saving clause envisaging forced sale,
foreclosure and mutual compensation in the event of protracted failure
to pay the terms assigned, otherwise the messuage to become the
absolute property of the tenant occupier upon expiry of the period of
years stipulated.

What rapid but insecure means to opulence might facilitate immediate
purchase?

system the result of a national equine handicap (flat or steeplechase)

population of Ireland according to census returns of 1901.

Were there schemes of wider scope?

A scheme to be formulated and submitted for approval to the harbour
commissioners for the exploitation of white coal (hydraulic power),
obtained by hydroelectric plant at peak of tide at Dublin bar or at
head of water at Poulaphouca or Powerscourt or catchment basins of main
streams for the economic production of 500,000 W.<eos>: 49.74884562338446

Liffey junction, and terminus of Midland Great Western Railway 43 to 45
North Wall, in proximity to the terminal stations or Dublin branches of
Great Central Railway, Midland Railway of England, City of Dublin Steam
Packet Company, Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, Dublin and
Glasgow Steam Packet Company, Glasgow, Dublin and Londonderry Steam

Palgrave, Murphy and Company, steamship owners, agents for steamers
from Mediterranean, Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium and Holland and
for Liverpool Underwriters’ Association, the cost of acquired rolling
stock for animal transport and of additional mileage operated by the
Dublin United Tramways Company, limited, to be covered by graziers’
fees.

Positing what protasis would the contraction for such several schemes
become a natural and necessary apodosis?

Given a guarantee equal to the sum sought, the support, by deed of gift
and transfer vouchers during donor’s lifetime or by bequest after
donor’s painless extinction, of eminent financiers (Blum Pasha,
Rothschild, Guggenheim, Hirsch, Montefiore, Morgan, Rockefeller)
possessing fortunes in 6 figures, amassed during a successful life, and
joining capital with opportunity the thing required was done.

What eventuality would render him independent of such wealth?

The independent discovery of a goldseam of inexhaustible ore.

For what reason did he meditate on schemes so difficult of realisation?

It was one of his axioms that similar meditations or the automatic
relation to himself of a narrative concerning himself or tranquil
recollection of the past when practised habitually before retiring for
the night alleviated fatigue and produced as a result sound repose and
renovated vitality.

His justifications?

As a physicist he had learned that of the 70 years of complete human
life at least 2/7, viz.<eos>: 61.89006276520008
20 years are passed in sleep.<eos>: 65.88670810625295
As a philosopher
he knew that at the termination of any allotted life only an
infinitesimal part of any person’s desires has been realised.<eos>: 46.558724279902684
As a
physiologist he believed in the artificial placation of malignant
agencies chiefly operative during somnolence.

What did he fear?

The committal of homicide or suicide during sleep by an aberration of
the light of reason, the incommensurable categorical intelligence
situated in the cerebral convolutions.

What were habitually his final meditations?

Of some one sole unique advertisement to cause passers to stop in
wonder, a poster novelty, with all extraneous accretions excluded,
reduced to its simplest and most efficient terms not exceeding the span
of casual vision and congruous with the velocity of modern life.

What did the first drawer unlocked contain?

from Martha Clifford (find M.<eos>: 200.4743219901982

What pleasant reflection accompanied this action?

The reflection that, apart from the letter in question, his magnetic
face, form and address had been favourably received during the course
of the preceding day by a wife (Mrs Josephine Breen, born Josie
Powell), a nurse, Miss Callan (Christian name unknown), a maid,
Gertrude (Gerty, family name unknown).

What possibility suggested itself?

The possibility of exercising virile power of fascination in the not
immediate future after an expensive repast in a private apartment in
the company of an elegant courtesan, of corporal beauty, moderately
mercenary, variously instructed, a lady by origin.

What did the 2nd drawer contain?

Documents: the birth certificate of Leopold Paula Bloom: an endowment
assurance policy of £ 500 in the Scottish Widows’ Assurance Society,
intestated Millicent (Milly) Bloom, coming into force at 25 years as

I, Rudolph Virag, now resident at no 52 Clanbrassil street, Dublin,
formerly of Szombathely in the kingdom of Hungary, hereby give notice
that I have assumed and intend henceforth upon all occasions and at all
times to be known by the name of Rudolph Bloom.

What other objects relative to Rudolph Bloom (born Virag) were in the
2nd drawer?

An indistinct daguerreotype of Rudolf Virag and his father Leopold
Virag executed in the year 1852 in the portrait atelier of their
(respectively) 1st and 2nd cousin, Stefan Virag of Szesfehervar,
Hungary.<eos>: 91.99492491735519

What reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive
melancholia did these objects evoke in Bloom?

An old man, widower, unkempt of hair, in bed, with head covered,
sighing: an infirm dog, Athos: aconite, resorted to by increasing doses
of grains and scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia: the
face in death of a septuagenarian, suicide by poison.

Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?

Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain
beliefs and practices.

As?

The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal: the
hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete
mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male
infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the
ineffability of the tetragrammaton: the sanctity of the sabbath.

How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?

Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than
other beliefs and practices now appeared.

What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?

Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a
retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between
Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely with
statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresia,
empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having
taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves).
Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant
consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by
suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in
the various centres mentioned.

Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these
migrations in narrator and listener?

In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of
narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence
of the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.

What idiosyncracies of the narrator were concomitant products of
amnesia?

Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat.
Occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an
inclined plate.<eos>: 51.89470756044396
Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of
food by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of
paper.

What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?

The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon
repletion.

What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?

The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the
possession of scrip.

Reduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which
these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values
to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity.

Successively, in descending helotic order: Poverty: that of the outdoor
hawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of bad and
doubtful debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector.<eos>: 65.42845971493419
Mendicancy:
that of the fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying 1/4d in
the £, sandwichman, distributor of throwaways, nocturnal vagrant,
insinuating sycophant, maimed sailor, blind stripling, superannuated
bailiff’s man, marfeast, lickplate, spoilsport, pickthank, eccentric
public laughingstock seated on bench of public park under discarded
perforated umbrella.<eos>: 23.326384670726156
Destitution: the inmate of Old Man’s House (Royal
Hospital), Kilmainham, the inmate of Simpson’s Hospital for reduced but
respectable men permanently disabled by gout or want of sight.<eos>: 49.997319082919866
Nadir of
misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic
pauper.

With which attendant indignities?

The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the
contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the
simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of
illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of
decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less
than nothing.

By what could such a situation be precluded?

By decease (change of state): by departure (change of place).

Which preferably?

The latter, by the line of least resistance.

What considerations rendered departure not entirely undesirable?

Constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects.
The habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated.<eos>: 61.95176445290635
The
necessity to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of
arrest.

What considerations rendered departure not irrational?

The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which
being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if
not disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication,
which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting
parties, which was impossible.

What considerations rendered departure desirable?

The attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad,
as represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or in
special ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and
hachures.

In Ireland?

The cliffs of Moher, the windy wilds of Connemara, lough Neagh with
submerged petrified city, the Giant’s Causeway, Fort Camden and Fort
Carlisle, the Golden Vale of Tipperary, the islands of Aran, the
pastures of royal Meath, Brigid’s elm in Kildare, the Queen’s Island
shipyard in Belfast, the Salmon Leap, the lakes of Killarney.

Abroad?

Ceylon (with spicegardens supplying tea to Thomas Kernan, agent for
Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 2 Mincing Lane, London, E.<eos>: 36.47310208874276
C., 5 Dame
street, Dublin), Jerusalem, the holy city (with mosque of Omar and gate
of Damascus, goal of aspiration), the straits of Gibraltar (the unique
birthplace of Marion Tweedy), the Parthenon (containing statues of nude
Grecian divinities), the Wall street money market (which controlled
international finance), the Plaza de Toros at La Linea, Spain (where
O’Hara of the Camerons had slain the bull), Niagara (over which no
human being had passed with impunity), the land of the Eskimos (eaters
of soap), the forbidden country of Thibet (from which no traveller
returns), the bay of Naples (to see which was to die), the Dead Sea.

Under what guidance, following what signs?

At sea, septentrional, by night the polestar, located at the point of
intersection of the right line from beta to alpha in Ursa Maior
produced and divided externally at omega and the hypotenuse of the
rightangled triangle formed by the line alpha omega so produced and the
line alpha delta of Ursa Maior.<eos>: 70.7999696566946
On land, meridional, a bispherical
moon, revealed in imperfect varying phases of lunation through the
posterior interstice of the imperfectly occluded skirt of a carnose
negligent perambulating female, a pillar of the cloud by day.

What public advertisement would divulge the occultation of the
departed?

£ 5 reward, lost, stolen or strayed from his residence 7 Eccles street,
missing gent about 40, answering to the name of Bloom, Leopold (Poldy),
height 5 ft 9 1/2 inches, full build, olive complexion, may have since
grown a beard, when last seen was wearing a black suit.<eos>: 82.06268442497694
Above sum will
be paid for information leading to his discovery.

What universal binomial denominations would be his as entity and
nonentity?

Assumed by any or known to none.<eos>: 114.50686787264989
Everyman or Noman.

What tributes his?

Honour and gifts of strangers, the friends of Everyman.<eos>: 46.69518779240972
A nymph
immortal, beauty, the bride of Noman.

Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?

Ever he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his
cometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic
planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of
space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events.<eos>: 62.28717589464164
Somewhere
imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey
the summons of recall.<eos>: 25.439191522541297
Whence, disappearing from the constellation of
the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the
constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of
peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on
malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial
resources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or the silver
king.

What would render such return irrational?

An unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through
reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible
time.

What play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?

The lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of
the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares,
rendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the
proximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of
warmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and
rendering desirable: the statue of Narcissus, sound without echo,
desired desire.

What advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an
unoccupied bed?

The removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human
(mature female) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation
of matutinal contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in
the case of trousers accurately folded and placed lengthwise between
the spring mattress (striped) and the woollen mattress (biscuit
section).

What past consecutive causes, before rising preapprehended, of
accumulated fatigue did Bloom, before rising, silently recapitulate?

The preparation of breakfast (burnt offering): intestinal congestion
and premeditative defecation (holy of holies): the bath (rite of John):
the funeral (rite of Samuel): the advertisement of Alexander Keyes
(Urim and Thummim): the unsubstantial lunch (rite of Melchisedek): the
visit to museum and national library (holy place): the bookhunt along
Bedford row, Merchants’ Arch, Wellington Quay (Simchath Torah): the
music in the Ormond Hotel (Shira Shirim): the altercation with a
truculent troglodyte in Bernard Kiernan’s premises (holocaust): a blank
period of time including a cardrive, a visit to a house of mourning, a
leavetaking (wilderness): the eroticism produced by feminine
exhibitionism (rite of Onan): the prolonged delivery of Mrs Mina
Purefoy (heave offering): the visit to the disorderly house of Mrs
Bella Cohen, 82 Tyrone street, lower, and subsequent brawl and chance
medley in Beaver street (Armageddon): nocturnal perambulation to and
from the cabman’s shelter, Butt Bridge (atonement).

What selfimposed enigma did Bloom about to rise in order to go so as to
conclude lest he should not conclude involuntarily apprehend?

The cause of a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted by
the insentient material of a strainveined timber table.

What selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering
multicoloured multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily
apprehending, not comprehend?

Who was M’Intosh?

What selfevident enigma pondered with desultory constancy during 30
years did Bloom now, having effected natural obscurity by the
extinction of artificial light, silently suddenly comprehend?

Where was Moses when the candle went out?

What imperfections in a perfect day did Bloom, walking, charged with
collected articles of recently disvested male wearing apparel,
silently, successively, enumerate?

A provisional failure to obtain renewal of an advertisement: to obtain
a certain quantity of tea from Thomas Kernan (agent for Pulbrook,
Robertson and Co, 5 Dame Street, Dublin, and 2 Mincing Lane, London E.
C.): to certify the presence or absence of posterior rectal orifice in
the case of Hellenic female divinities: to obtain admission (gratuitous
or paid) to the performance of _Leah_ by Mrs Bandmann Palmer at the
Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street.

What impression of an absent face did Bloom, arrested, silently recall?

The face of her father, the late Major Brian Cooper Tweedy, Royal
Dublin Fusiliers, of Gibraltar and Rehoboth, Dolphin’s Barn.

What recurrent impressions of the same were possible by hypothesis?

Retreating, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens
street, with constant uniform acceleration, along parallel lines
meeting at infinity, if produced: along parallel lines, reproduced from
infinity, with constant uniform retardation, at the terminus of the
Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, returning.

What miscellaneous effects of female personal wearing apparel were
perceived by him?

A pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies’ hose, a pair of new
violet garters, a pair of outsize ladies’ drawers of India mull, cut on
generous lines, redolent of opoponax, jessamine and Muratti’s Turkish
cigarettes and containing a long bright steel safety pin, folded
curvilinear, a camisole of batiste with thin lace border, an accordion
underskirt of blue silk moirette, all these objects being disposed
irregularly on the top of a rectangular trunk, quadruple battened,
having capped corners, with multicoloured labels, initialled on its
fore side in white lettering B.<eos>: 53.05947945914274
C.<eos>: 3.246585668467089
T.<eos>: 3.737471984495714
(Brian Cooper Tweedy).

What impersonal objects were perceived?

A commode, one leg fractured, totally covered by square cretonne
cutting, apple design, on which rested a lady’s black straw hat.
Orangekeyed ware, bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware
and ironmongery manufacturer, 21, 22, 23 Moore street, disposed
irregularly on the washstand and floor and consisting of basin,
soapdish and brushtray (on the washstand, together), pitcher and night
article (on the floor, separate).

Bloom’s acts?

He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining
articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the
bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the
proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to
the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the
bed.

How?

With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or
not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress
being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous
under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of
lust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of
conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of
marriage, of sleep and of death.

What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?

New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form,
female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs,
some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.

If he had smiled why would he have smiled?

To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to
enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if
the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first,
last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor
alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.

What preceding series?

Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell
d’Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father
Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society’s Horse Show,
Maggot O’Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of
Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an
unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon
Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman
John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a
bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E.<eos>: 72.46730061409227
(Blazes) Boylan and so
each and so on to no last term.

What were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and
late occupant of the bed?

Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a
billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a
boaster).

Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal
proportion and commercial ability?

Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding
members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably
transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with
desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene
comprehension and apprehension.

With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections
affected?

Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.

Envy?

Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the
superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic
piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of
a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental
female organism, passive but not obtuse.

Jealousy?

Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately
the agent and reagent of attraction.<eos>: 65.95093949153812
Because attraction between
agent(s) and reagent(s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion
of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial
reentrance.<eos>: 71.3880056876349
Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of
attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.

Abnegation?

In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the
establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden
Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and
reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of
ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d)
extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial
prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current
expenses, net proceeds divided.

Equanimity?

As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or
understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in
accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar
similarity.<eos>: 80.2110234058591
As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the
planet in consequence of a collision with a dark sun.<eos>: 32.77344959540083
As less
reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and
animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement,
misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust,
malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail,
contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas,
trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion
from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence
with the king’s enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter,
wilful and premeditated murder.<eos>: 13.292744188514218
As not more abnormal than all other
parallel processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence,
resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and
its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits,
indulged inclinations, significant disease.<eos>: 42.04257029066861
As more than inevitable,
irreparable.

Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?

From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but
outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially
violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the
adulterously violated.

What retribution, if any?

Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right.<eos>: 67.59554116083336
Duel by
combat, no.<eos>: 13.883155483231855
Divorce, not now.<eos>: 13.241545604850305
Exposure by mechanical artifice
(automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses),
not yet.<eos>: 105.58487108384253
Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault
with evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly.
Hushmoney by moral influence, possibly.<eos>: 97.38126757513372
If any, positively, connivance,
introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of
publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation,
alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from
the other, protecting the separator from both.

By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of
incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?

The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed
intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion
between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and
the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously
inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the
variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by
inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite
proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic
transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into
its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine
subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past
participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice:
the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual
production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest
or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of
nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.

In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and
reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?

Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial
hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored
(the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of
Greece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female
hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and
seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude,
insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression,
expressive of mute immutable mature animality.

The visible signs of antesatisfaction?

An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a
tentative revelation: a silent contemplation.

Then?

He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each
plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure
prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.

The visible signs of postsatisfaction?

A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a
solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.

What followed this silent action?

Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation,
catechetical interrogation.

With what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?

Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between
Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in
the vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co,
Limited, 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and
response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty),
surname unknown.<eos>: 35.64112156493112
Positive: he included mention of a performance by Mrs
Bandmann Palmer of _Leah_ at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South
King street, an invitation to supper at Wynn’s (Murphy’s) Hotel, 35, 36
and 37 Lower Abbey street, a volume of peccaminous pornographical
tendency entituled _Sweets of Sin_, anonymous author a gentleman of
fashion, a temporary concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement
in the course of a postcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since
completely recovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author,
eldest surviving son of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an
aeronautical feat executed by him (narrator) in the presence of a
witness, the professor and author aforesaid, with promptitude of
decision and gymnastic flexibility.

Was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?

Absolutely.

Which event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?

Stephen Dedalus, professor and author.

What limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were
perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the
course of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?

By the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been
celebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8
September 1870), viz.<eos>: 54.81393209613944
8 October, and consummated on the same date with
female issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated
on the 10 September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse,
with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last
taken place 5 weeks previous, viz.<eos>: 94.68948554362261
27 November 1893, to the birth on 29
December 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894,
aged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days
during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without
ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ.<eos>: 115.83574418835353
By the narrator a
limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete
mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place
since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage,
of the female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there
remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which, in consequence of
a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the
consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of
action had been circumscribed.

How?

By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine
destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration
for which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences,
projected or effected.

What moved visibly above the listener’s and the narrator’s invisible
thoughts?

The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of
concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.

In what directions did listener and narrator lie?

Listener, S.<eos>: 79.06332993160548
E.<eos>: 1.5381861561152315
by E.: Narrator, N.<eos>: 50.173490653793905
W.<eos>: 1.343769496026818
by W.: on the 53rd parallel of
latitude, N., and 6th meridian of longitude, W.: at an angle of 45° to
the terrestrial equator.

In what state of rest or motion?

At rest relatively to themselves and to each other.<eos>: 61.09460491427314
In motion being
each and both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by
the proper perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of
neverchanging space.

In what posture?

Listener: reclined semilaterally, left, left hand under head, right leg
extended in a straight line and resting on left leg, flexed, in the
attitude of Gea-Tellus, fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed.<eos>: 89.90884638677493
Narrator:
reclined laterally, left, with right and left legs flexed, the index
finger and thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose,
in the attitude depicted in a snapshot photograph made by Percy Apjohn,
the childman weary, the manchild in the womb.

Womb?<eos>: 66.71514739425443
Weary?

He rests.<eos>: 20.653495172035566
He has travelled.

With?

Sinbad the Sailor and Tinbad the Tailor and Jinbad the Jailer and
Whinbad the Whaler and Ninbad the Nailer and Finbad the Failer and
Binbad the Bailer and Pinbad the Pailer and Minbad the Mailer and
Hinbad the Hailer and Rinbad the Railer and Dinbad the Kailer and
Vinbad the Quailer and Linbad the Yailer and Xinbad the Phthailer.

auk’s egg in the night of the bed of all the auks of the rocs of
Darkinbad the Brightdayler.

Where?

[ 18 ]


Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his
breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel when
he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his
highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan
that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing
all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was
actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all
her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and
earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God
help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and
lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was
pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like
her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a
welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here
and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her
dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats
especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that
and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always
if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much
better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I
suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have
a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till
they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as
much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre
sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was
O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he
sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day
I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones
she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into
a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying
on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more
like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same
besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor
paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I
was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it
not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by
his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her
so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was
really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it
planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember
Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he
not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and
turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what
harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to
him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever
met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle
in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in
with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as
I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a
letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the
paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the
blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably
that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all
men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is
now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old
fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I
care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though
Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my
nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace
padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell
of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by
getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat
without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was
drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of
course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table
on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing
my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see her aunt if
you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on
with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you
have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters
but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be
alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I
found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a
little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave
her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do
out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out
the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I
couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar
and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the
place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because
he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere
and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan
gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there
steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb
to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he
has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out
and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the
satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be
always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking
boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id
confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my
garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I
know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging
drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this
that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would
because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in
the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a
stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and
he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he
is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it
tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine
Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what
he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply
ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it
till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your
lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the
world about it people make its only the first time after that its just
the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man
without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when
you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish
some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in
his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul
almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to
Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and
I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my
child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where
you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done
with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put
it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he
want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat
hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he
Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in
the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never
turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost
for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them
Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense
off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre
married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the
pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt
like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though
I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of
his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it
who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of
drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they
stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking
green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with
the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American
that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do
to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took
the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt
lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I
popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful
to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when
I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in
Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and
tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing
about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that
evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it
brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to
church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only
grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I
lit the lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that
tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or
whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is
not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my
hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a
thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think
a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life
felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must
have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with
a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into
you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious
look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a
tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on
me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt
washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice
invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if
someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went
through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina
Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up
with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a
smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like
a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the
last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and
bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied
till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what
supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was
married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has
more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting
Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him
off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I
know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing
and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming
and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not
liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over
politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a
carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive
about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for
I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he
annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot
of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often
wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family
physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was
crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with
her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever
he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me
the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that
finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I
know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out
to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know
plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch
him with my veil and gloves on going out 1 kiss then would send them
all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of
course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him
that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love
him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might
imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of
a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it
out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and
wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the
night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I
want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper
with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too
much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know
more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie
whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I
said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash
possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick
when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the
indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what
spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at
that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was
too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged
afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of
laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling
out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great
humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it
meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us
not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault
she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes
got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her
face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she
must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment
she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk
about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes
he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him
just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might
murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes
mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when
he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he
always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and
now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ 10000 for a postcard
U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff
to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what
could you make of a man like that Id rather die 20 times over than
marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like
me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and
he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick
that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man
yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and
do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating
drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask
us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because
they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off
flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say
its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have
been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being
hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do
besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they

theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he
noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C
with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both
ordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his
two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it
was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed
breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting
all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long
one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got
after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish
times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to
Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the
turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea
2 days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him
because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he
meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that
if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill
stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still
I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of
a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to
mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my
stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another
time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I
could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world
that I what did he say I could give 9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and
beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because
the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in
the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere
I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell
DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on
the choir stairs after I sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting
for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown
part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was
always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his
mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a
place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him
about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there
and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it
or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an
idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got
me so cheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself anyhow begging me
to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming
along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had
to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape
of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me
when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject
of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced
things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels
even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one
in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see
every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain
I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the
Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the
Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking
slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they
can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on
it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were
you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me
his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it
was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he
pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he
said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an
excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time
till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his
waistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in
the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them
and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the
sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet
if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you
never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it
if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers
outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him
from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he
circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do
everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting
all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the
butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me
that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to
any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we
met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw
I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was
always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky
man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake
dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it
used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in
Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children
seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice
a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman
when he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote
the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it
simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to
embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the
same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you
think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the
door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface
Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after
dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me
professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in
his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out
you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I
thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches
first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was
trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he
must have been a bit late because it was 1/4 after 3 when I saw the 2
Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch
he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after
when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty
when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even
put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week
were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers
anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms
at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new
bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next
room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the
wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all
very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we
never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes
going where he is besides something always happens with him the time
going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for
the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with
the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and
the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion
for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two
gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was
too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a
good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd
have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him
O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I
wonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the
train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots
of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly
be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone
in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something
about him 1 or 2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the
window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what
would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last
concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall
Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen
Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my
singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts
when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him
managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to
sing in the _Stabat Mater_ by going around saying he was putting Lead
Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out
he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some
old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein
lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and
nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very
intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats
all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I
hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and
Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd
East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and
just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was
lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty
he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the
road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could
have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of
the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of
dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their
fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love
to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish
cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from
Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham
battles on the 15 acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the
march past the 10th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O
the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made
his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me
a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen
up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like
I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going
round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave
this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the
knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or
tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go
and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money
and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I
could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when
I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the
expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with
his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat
always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from
behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the
dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so
quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the
way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish
tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly
welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he
was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the
stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20
quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for
me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that
sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming
back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor
looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first
noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I
wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my
fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for
I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers
were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have
slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always
hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down
your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a
great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case
if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one
thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I
think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them
either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she
didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of
silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought
them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one
change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into
him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id
want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips
he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a
delightful figure line 11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance
across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill
have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it
the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his
money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a
cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret
that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die
of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that
antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the
fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats
all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was
the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like
new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place
and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to
him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to
wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax
and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the
skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger
after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry
handkerchiefs about 6/- in all sure you cant get on in this world
without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it
around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea
into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues
itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all
the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners
3 whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the
other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because
they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every
day for the 4 years more I have of life up to 35 no Im what am I at all
Ill be 33 in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith
shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys
on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down
to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham
street 1st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it
as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the
day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of
Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads
only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black
mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny
story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster
knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and
the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing
like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master
Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her
ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and
her a—e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that
pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody
can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that
twice I remember when I came to page 50 the part about where she hangs
him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a
woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out
of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the
crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have
a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of
her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and
she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar
the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted
the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me
too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to
chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it
and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank
where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day
of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with
him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe
like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching
about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still
only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could
have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada
once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly
Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I
lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming
into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no
good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as
I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot
of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me
altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and
cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I
went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes
take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles
off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my
backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in
Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as
insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were
giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of
her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second
time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see
him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for
me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs
Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him
being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled
I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely
sorry and Im sure you were

yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he
made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one
anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep
that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out
for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2
the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up
there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide
it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a
man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down
out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it
with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat
market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the
statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was
pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one
side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved
them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed
outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to
try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was 1 of the 7
wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night
coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade
to make you feel nice and watery I went into 1 of them it was so biting
cold I couldnt keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was
a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see
me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it
before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not
afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the
woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for
a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the
job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee
palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes
only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish
photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her
and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some
jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply
the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of
the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his
teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent
they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly
enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a
pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate
looking student that stopped in no 28 with the Citrons Penrose nearly
caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to
my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till
he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get
him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker
than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond
everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only
could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it
the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an
hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant
I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those
men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch
myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come
again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when
he made me spend the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was
coming for about 5 minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him
after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or
anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain
who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man
theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice
about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my
eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue
between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday
two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday

frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those
engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and
out of them all sides like the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor
men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in
those roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half
of those old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying
about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the W
C I’ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there
for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres
last Januarys paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the
hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and
refreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get
like Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on
black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big
giant compared with their 3 Rock mountain they think is so great with
the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and
the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time
weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs
Stanhope sent me from the B Marche paris what a shame my dearest
Doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other name
was just a p c to tell you I sent the little present have just had a
jolly warm bath and feel a very clean dog now enjoyed it wogger she
called him wogger wd give anything to be back in Gib and hear you sing
Waiting and in old Madrid Concone is the name of those exercises he
bought me one of those new some word I couldnt make out shawls amusing
things but tear for the least thing still there lovely I think dont you
will always think of the lovely teas we had together scrumptious
currant scones and raspberry wafers I adore well now dearest Doggerina
be sure and write soon kind she left out regards to your father also
Captain Grove with love yrs affly Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit
married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was
awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to
step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was
given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them
expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic
all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or
jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious
old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the 2
things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the
women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole
insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all
my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking
in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose
theyre dead long ago the 2 of them its like all through a mist makes
you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to
myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker
than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up
and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we
were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in
her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning
with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an
opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father
and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the
windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like
all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at
myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was
attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent
looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the
shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the
excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been
nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me
the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East
Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by
that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as
he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave
me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a
Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a
whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards
of it O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one
decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and
his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my
shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the
chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on
the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them
at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago
it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her
address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were
always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and
the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those
Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything
he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was
blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I
did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a
Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage
made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it
got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run
away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or
aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me
waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and
booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing
everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when
general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great
fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there
from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the
son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums
rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with
messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their
jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men
to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the
gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about
Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum
lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil
with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his
nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner
but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room
on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky
talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along
I suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a
letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with
bits of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails
listening to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an
instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your
hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me
looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the
opposite house that medical in Holles street the nurse was after when I
put on my gloves and hat at the window to show I was going out not a
notion what I meant arent they thick never understand what you say even
youd want to print it up on a big poster for them not even if you shake
hands twice with the left he didnt recognise me either when I half
frowned at him outside Westland row chapel where does their great
intelligence come in Id like to know grey matter they have it all in
their tail if you ask me those country gougers up in the City Arms
intelligence they had a damn sight less than the bulls and cows they
were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to
swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of
paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a
poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some
advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed dear Madam
only his letter and the card from Milly this morning see she wrote a
letter to him who did I get the last letter from O Mrs Dwenn now what
possessed her to write from Canada after so many years to know the
recipe I had for pisto madrileno Floey Dillon since she wrote to say
she was married to a very rich architect if Im to believe all I hear
with a villa and eight rooms her father was an awfully nice man he was
near seventy always goodhumoured well now Miss Tweedy or Miss Gillespie
theres the piannyer that was a solid silver coffee service he had too
on the mahogany sideboard then dying so far away I hate people that
have always their poor story to tell everybody has their own troubles
that poor Nancy Blake died a month ago of acute neumonia well I didnt
know her so well as all that she was Floeys friend more than mine poor
Nancy its a bother having to answer he always tells me the wrong things
and no stops to say like making a speech your sad bereavement
symph̸athy I always make that mistake and new̸phew with 2 double yous
in I hope hell write me a longer letter the next time if its a thing he
really likes me O thanks be to the great God I got somebody to give me
what I badly wanted to put some heart up into me youve no chances at
all in this place like you used long ago I wish somebody would write me
a loveletter his wasnt much and I told him he could write what he liked
yours ever Hugh Boylan in old Madrid stuff silly women believe love is
sighing I am dying still if he wrote it I suppose thered be some truth
in it true or no it fills up your whole day and life always something
to think about every moment and see it all round you like a new world I
could write the answer in bed to let him imagine me short just a few
words not those long crossed letters Atty Dillon used to write to the
fellow that was something in the four courts that jilted her after out
of the ladies letterwriter when I told her to say a few simple words he
could twist how he liked not acting with precipat precipitancy with
equal candour the greatest earthly happiness answer to a gentlemans
proposal affirmatively my goodness theres nothing else its all very
fine for them but as for being a woman as soon as youre old they might
as well throw you out in the bottom of the ashpit.

Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio
brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her
to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin
to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her
in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her
appearance ugly as she was near 80 or a 100 her face a mass of wrinkles
with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the
Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack
flying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken English sailors took
all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough
in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there
was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black
blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on
Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell
bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an
admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him
up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window
then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making
an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it
up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill
instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps
singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the
old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under
the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what
kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was
sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way
what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish
nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to
be married to him in 3 years time theres many a true word spoken in
jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about
myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I
suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all
the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and
the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the
black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it
was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in
the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the
rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all
about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail
careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was
a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and
throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that
white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could
without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was
tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be
the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those
frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever
they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots
Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when
they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing
yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever
he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I
was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness
out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last
day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he
wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was
awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me
with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop
even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was
afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once
took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered
with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of
youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with
you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling
there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I
pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I
opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I
had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first
tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt
awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the
same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got
over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back
the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the
middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was
his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was
rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the
whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed
come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed
do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now
flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly 20
years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put
his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young
still about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is
quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has
she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever
dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you
might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I
was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in
from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and
pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle
hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to
read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he
hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he
always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso
swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long
preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle
and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and
me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that
would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it
looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M
Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well
its better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with
bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I
wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my
mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows
after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along
Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other
side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like
Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down
at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars
pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was
to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world
and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while
they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up
Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that
was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from
on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral
necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay
of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits
like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the
sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at
the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow
for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that
Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on
you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me
that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south
Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they
were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it
like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure 18 carrot gold
because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that
the sandfrog shower from Africa and that derelict ship that came up to
the harbour Marie the Marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that
was Gardner yes I can see his face cleanshaven
Frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong that train again weeping tone once in the

bootmakers and publicans I beg your pardon coach I thought you were a
wheelbarrow theyd die down dead off their feet if ever they got a
chance of walking down the Alameda on an officers arm like me on the
bandnight my eyes flash my bust that they havent passion God help their
poor head I knew more about men and life when I was 15 than theyll all
know at 50 they dont know how to sing a song like that Gardner said no
man could look at my mouth and teeth smiling like that and not think of
it I was afraid he mightnt like my accent first he so English all

anyhow he always said theyre so snotty about themselves some of those
cads he wasnt a bit like that he was dead gone on my lips let them get
a husband first thats fit to be looked at and a daughter like mine or

least thing better yes hold them like that a bit on my side piano
quietly sweeeee theres that train far away pianissimo eeeee one more

that was a relief wherever you be let your wind go free who knows if
that pork chop I took with my cup of tea after was quite good with the
heat I couldnt smell anything off it Im sure that queerlooking man in
the porkbutchers is a great rogue I hope that lamp is not smoking fill
my nose up with smuts better than having him leaving the gas on all
night I couldnt rest easy in my bed in Gibraltar even getting up to see
why am I so damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter
its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was
only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes
dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those
mountains the something Nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with
the little bit of a short shift I had up to heat myself I loved dancing
about in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite
used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the
summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then
stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the
chamber performance I put out the light too so then there were 2 of us
goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow I hope hes not going to get
in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again
coming in at 4 in the morning it must be if not more still he had the
manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night
squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink
water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon
haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like
the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down
in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling
up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then
play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has
she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate
their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like
that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I
wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice I bought I think
Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with
some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those 2 lb
pots of mixed plum and apple from the London and Newcastle Williams and
Woods goes twice as far only for the bones I hate those eels cod yes
Ill get a nice piece of cod Im always getting enough for 3 forgetting
anyway Im sick of that everlasting butchers meat from Buckleys loin
chops and leg beef and rib steak and scrag of mutton and calfs pluck
the very name is enough or a picnic suppose we all gave 5/- each and or
let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who Mrs Fleming and
drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him
examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters
no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed
sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks
there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday
anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit
Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the
seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after
him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked
could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it
came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all
down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the
tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping
out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of
course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his
flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all
the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was
black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed
chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City
Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he
wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was
no love lost between us thats 1 consolation I wonder what kind is that
book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other
Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with
his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white
shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather
all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell
of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan
bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the
fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa
and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to
climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago
besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at
night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of
salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was
going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or
Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the
way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he
was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely
places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the
gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of
and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was
going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry
my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the
plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old
beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and
put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of
that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news 20 years in
jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine
his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles
away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows
to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a
madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute
like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed
Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better
than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and
he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was
looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits
making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit
there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling
especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl
down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather
instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not
like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the
same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way
he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the
place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming
in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as
I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then
doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to
look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack
statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got
that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for 2
shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right
not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at
the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to
understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant
say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and
helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its
me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on
the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now
shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me
whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly
come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her
round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well
he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to
go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I
smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I
sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I
tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a
parting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out
no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your
blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle
blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on
show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at
her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you
then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the
Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me
afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that
touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always
trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for
Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed
like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me
there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to
get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same
little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but
he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the
Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance
on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands
swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything
deep yet I never came properly till I was what 22 or so it went into
the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that
Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with
sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he
looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and
supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man
gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a
few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it
really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love
in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each
other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit
foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and
poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes
always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to
put her hair up at 15 my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time
enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes
pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too
but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a
fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we
met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to
see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough
till I gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that
now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me
that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because
how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night
before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to
leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as
she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was
the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself
they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the
two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever
going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming
Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that
old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the
things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course
shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly
dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something
and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends
to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you
please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father
such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the
cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at
the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won
them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody
saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand
funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody
hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head
I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been
hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the
ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was
something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and
now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband
getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they
have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats
her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres
some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead
in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if
Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt
that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he
had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that
pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows
theres always something wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4 weeks usual
monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like
that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him
to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about
insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt
give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his
glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul
thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could
all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it
out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry
supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery
hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a
woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up
for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is
better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience
above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me
pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just
put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn
it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a
virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you
could be a widow or divorced 40 times over a daub of red ink would do
or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this
pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what
between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too
jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the
other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor
with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think
it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I
might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next
time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face
wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me
after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I
made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse
and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be
he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits
easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling
like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for
a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning
dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look
how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit
here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get
up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey
lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore

who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I
something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when
was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about 3 weeks I ought to go to
the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that
white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick
Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called
it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting
round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every
little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of
course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last
man in the world besides theres something queer about their children
always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what
I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one
thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly
old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and
could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the
rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by
the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I
can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and
needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by
Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the
same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and
asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all
the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked
sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows
what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out
frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you
lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever
enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad
crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious
Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and
of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he
had me always at myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and I said I
hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him
up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited
me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in
Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about 10 minutes
as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking
after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half
sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand
for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his
blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool
of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O
beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and
rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy
anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st
opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom
pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk
and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I
laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight
sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so
that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose
there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at
the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard
bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth
breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to
show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a
pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out
that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put
together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody
I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big
square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway
wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt
creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere
still she must have given him great value for his money of course he
has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll
have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God
help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always
reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often
enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to
admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like
my bed God here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses
were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard
street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on
the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the
men with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse
and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always
somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always
know who was in there last every time were just getting on right
something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr
Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old
lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives
impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the
Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the
freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along
in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much
consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed
judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres
Georges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour wait two oclock well
thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody
climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that
little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if
he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I
dont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their
lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont
believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats
Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in
real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is
disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads
and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about
with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow
poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both
sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let
him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the
one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews
used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast
or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough
for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his
own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that
wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and
lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder
was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too
no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants
me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that
forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some
little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the
College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his
nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at
those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no
use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr
Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in
the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd
be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind
in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that
bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or
other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys
husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye
trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old
green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way
like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call
that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with
their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping
that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be
sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still
though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of
them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches
if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well
when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to
squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after
his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im
sorry in a way for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do
unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some
pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come
home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully
becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at
the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he
borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and
squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a
wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough
that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the
preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and
Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the
second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly
sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying
too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had
a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart
_sweet_heart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet _tart_
goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in
it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we
sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even
transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed
say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I
wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a
university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he
driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have
got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look
young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and
me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge
station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats 11 years ago
now yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into mourning for
what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for
me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted
hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time
he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord
Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw
him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God
yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out
the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met
before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either
besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after
that the 10 of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on
its way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise
in society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look
at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about
poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or
standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only
getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry
when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not
an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I
wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15
yesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose
hes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not
that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting
down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of
course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was
out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not
a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson
they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont
find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where
poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully
coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point
the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back
there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that
for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly
bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young
star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to
talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts
ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in
their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like
to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young
those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace
from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or
something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men
like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely
little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and
his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and
poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his
lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth
if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and
white he looks with his boyish face I would too in 1/2 a minute even if
some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no
danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I
suppose never dream of washing it from 1 years end to the other the
most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure
itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age
Ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard
comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out
Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew
who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the
same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him
till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and
mistress publicly too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he
becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though

no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no
nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because
I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a
cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place
pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so
barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar
way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a
butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course
hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might
as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something
better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its
because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he
couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the
amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white
for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with
that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so
soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those
cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has
a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it
didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts
his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be
you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick
and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl
for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street
no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me
up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands
jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling
her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if
he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he
going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course
the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either
its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all
those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can
I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with
him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the
wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a
womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything
unnatural where we havent 1 atom of any kind of expression in us all of
us the same 2 lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the
dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita
theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a
madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a
woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young
no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the
fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking
would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd
know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not
care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of
those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near
the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only
sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back
over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow
with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me
up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do
themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up
somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us
the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course
it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and
when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after
coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his
wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten
again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the
love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well
he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he
knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to
sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for
Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around
down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled
up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like
to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I
dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be
governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one
another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around
drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on
horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop
sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know
what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they
all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I
never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away
from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the
usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a
fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to
make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two
dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that
disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in
that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some
poor child but I knew well Id never have another our 1st death too it
was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into
the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I
felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of
roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and
pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining
himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to
love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends
they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some
woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder
they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I
suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like
that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I
suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the
next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I
wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had
the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave
me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and
Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown
myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the
bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and
Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am
a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day
older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish
como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all
I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person
place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs
Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the
two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the
Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant
what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and
wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in
bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad
luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and
something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might
like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the
criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you
see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself
not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend
we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is
dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head
sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres
the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his
writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he
does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes
making the breakfast for 1 he can make it for 2 Im sure Im not going to
take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house
like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated
person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with
the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown
that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long
ago in Walpoles only 8/6 or 18/6 Ill just give him one more chance Ill
get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I
might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and
tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in

ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no
God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why
dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or
whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves

seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes 16 years ago
my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a
flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that
was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today
yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a
woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the
pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I
wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was
thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and
Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all
birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the
pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing
round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls
laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the
morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who
else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market
all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half
asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the
steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle
thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and
turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop
and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice
hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night
and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the
watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown
torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the
glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all
the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and
the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and
Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put
the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a
red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well
as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again
yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and
first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could
feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and
yes I said yes I will Yes.
