Avg perplexity: 45.68998435017711

<eos>: 22.560406422524053
Good bye.<eos>: 13.952879750846993
I thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes.<eos>: 45.977779691108054
Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr.<eos>: 45.2410927727902
The loo table, however, did not appear. Mr.<eos>: 17.609933556352484
He placed himself by her. Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.<eos>: 25.934415968943483
Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.<eos>: 35.578803843528
It was
generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to
_her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
suspicions of the impertinent.<eos>: 48.66825609270322
"I would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from any one but myself.<eos>: 92.81520636046896
The country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is not it, Mr.<eos>: 34.59874552052515
I am impatient to see him."

"In point of composition," said Mary, "his letter does not seem
defective.<eos>: 22.535257899255228
Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.

"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a
vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper I ever met with.<eos>: 30.152443603090354
He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up
and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air
gloomy.<eos>: 51.255119220500546
She had even
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,
an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.<eos>: 39.027753592022016
They are gone down to
Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to
stay, I do not know how long.<eos>: 38.290725889270924
How could I
     be so silly as to wish it!<eos>: 38.960985006984934
no.--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings."

"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions."

"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else."

"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?" said he,
with a look of doubt.

"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr.<eos>: 57.495239687995955
Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her
poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their
charms.

At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.<eos>: 39.44756379291337
_I_ should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."




CHAPTER XVIII.


The first week of their return was soon gone.<eos>: 49.63659233654755
His pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter
him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by.<eos>: 51.4263188090504
Darcy, who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,

"Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.--I entreat you
not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."

Mr.<eos>: 44.06466074244662
As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she
considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it
known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go.<eos>: 58.9669179916815
And then when we came away it was such fun!<eos>: 73.31316521344624
But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew.<eos>: 42.48999865763298
Not that I am afraid
of _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks."

Elizabeth did not know what to make of it.<eos>: 32.10308679883003
She had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.

"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs.<eos>: 56.53516366827597
Brighton, and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton."

"Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down to
table.<eos>: 49.885944413526126
You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous.<eos>: 43.51249864795415
That she should receive an offer of
marriage from Mr.<eos>: 23.71877098258208
"Do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense?<eos>: 34.64560513051809
She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_,
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched
reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr.<eos>: 44.028132108166055
She could
think of nothing but of Mr.<eos>: 31.315454468211318
An union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
family.

How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,
she could not imagine.<eos>: 28.42897715895882
Having never even fancied herself in
love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from
her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often
boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to
every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the
feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those
regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their
tranquillity.

"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs.<eos>: 50.33378464811966
If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my
     impertinence.<eos>: 29.00158873257831
When Mr.<eos>: 2.820923248578635
Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"

"Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for
himself."

"You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but
which I have never acknowledged.<eos>: 72.69975477490026
Robinson; did not
I mention it to you?<eos>: 39.101903966893985
It is a nice long walk, and Mr.<eos>: 23.739694093285554
It is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland."

"But why all this secrecy?<eos>: 57.20131594850994
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.

The possibility of Mr.<eos>: 48.67859373432683
_that_ abominable Mr.<eos>: 13.27523802697956
Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?"

She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her
former prejudices had been removed.

"I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary.<eos>: 56.90105291030196
Indeed, Mr.<eos>: 5.532018664879167
I shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be."

Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
Mrs.<eos>: 32.97009269826073
Wickham's being among them.

Mrs.<eos>: 15.082573517579927
it cannot be.<eos>: 12.747896622761338
His consenting to marry
her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking.<eos>: 48.55879192980264
Such a disappointment!<eos>: 41.11415486295949
But it is of small importance."

"I might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of
offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?
Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil?<eos>: 67.38448900703492
One day's delay she observed,
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite
so obstinate as usual.<eos>: 37.61446201417495
my dear Mr.<eos>: 6.659460244440013
Bingley urged Mr.<eos>: 11.434719321552432
Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his
friend to join it.

"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance.<eos>: 23.124984481147283
Is not he a charming man?<eos>: 62.54063183591191
I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction."

"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at
Pemberley.<eos>: 53.035005254228494
Darcy's
objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend.

But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from Mrs.<eos>: 38.41442211423557
If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
at all."

       *       *       *       *       *

The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same
kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs.<eos>: 38.269026249438795
Collins
very gravely--"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you.<eos>: 35.55708331702282
But before she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her.

"My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else!<eos>: 25.184015639505652
Collins's wife by this time, had not it
been for her own perverseness.<eos>: 29.378471272439604
It does not often happen
that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before."

"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.<eos>: 64.41819668510709
Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial.<eos>: 26.957490550013567
Bingley--is not he?<eos>: 65.44839806150893
Her face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.<eos>: 65.43299435821906
Bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend.

Mr.<eos>: 47.78849843302776
Amazed at the
alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he
uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few
minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most
uncomfortable of her life.<eos>: 67.38005911225153
I will not encourage
the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn."

A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr.<eos>: 39.56109348157454
But it has been the study of
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule."

"Such as vanity and pride."

"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.<eos>: 62.022810044436916
Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
dependence?<eos>: 58.291205290086005
Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit
him, if you do not."

"You are over scrupulous surely.<eos>: 28.239493000514443
Philips.--The usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter.<eos>: 61.39212600273883
I know not in what manner, under what form of
     falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to
     be wondered at.<eos>: 90.52989538584504
Lord, how ashamed I should be of not
being married before three and twenty!<eos>: 95.60263770475943
After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour.<eos>: 54.700125416780104
What will Wickham say?<eos>: 54.166272495868064
Bennet with civil
self-command to Miss Lucas.<eos>: 52.46448687707659
How is half such a sum to be
repaid?"

Mr.<eos>: 25.466343724883902
It would be dreadful!<eos>: 23.083070700100055
"She
looks sickly and cross.--Yes, she will do for him very well.<eos>: 33.899657221735254
Have not you always hated him?"

How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate!<eos>: 83.84529875088366
You have employed your
time much better.<eos>: 72.34358244623566

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE:

A Novel.

In Three Volumes.

By the Author of "Sense and Sensibility."

VOL.<eos>: 46.44201624777334
As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him
come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done."

"Oh!<eos>: 34.56622075152512
Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.
Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.--The
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be
otherwise explained.

"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or
other, of which we can form no idea.<eos>: 46.429467824579966
I would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion
for any thing more.<eos>: 48.747850481938116
Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball.<eos>: 38.48103875314389
You refuse, then, to oblige me.<eos>: 26.354234180136196
Collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear.<eos>: 74.20524795542383
Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,

"You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may
prove so; for else they will be destitute enough.<eos>: 48.74009466424575
When those dances
were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr.<eos>: 49.09882072343175
The visit
was returned in due form.<eos>: 96.10098770174021
Darcy--that Mr.<eos>: 8.75967343066589
And when I returned home, the ----shire
was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time.<eos>: 53.00476084358612
her liveliness had been never worse timed.<eos>: 40.65087986624972
Bingley
was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.

In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!
how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a
like manner.<eos>: 70.53388751484805
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when Mr.<eos>: 65.21068931139492
Every thing nourishes what is
strong already.<eos>: 75.38121342308773
Elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
dinner time.<eos>: 60.903338168892006
I do assure you that I am not
one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time.<eos>: 72.03744439209754
He then handed her
in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when
he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.

"But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here."

Elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off.

"Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but
a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have
happened!"

"A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.

"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there
twice!--How much I shall have to tell!"

Elizabeth privately added, "And how much I shall have to conceal."

Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr.<eos>: 62.764887425541765
Nothing occurred between
them that could justify the hopes of his sister.<eos>: 48.34017505870824
my dear," said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady
Catherine.<eos>: 33.799101827921426
But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine
here, I am determined.<eos>: 35.84985516280958
You are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."

"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any
possible claim on me, in the present instance.<eos>: 49.81826796791381
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement
took place?<eos>: 80.90602855468124
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
But I hope you will not mind it: it is
all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
him, except just now and then.<eos>: 41.83043621246362
She was very
equal therefore to address Mr.<eos>: 62.73889141206369
He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,
     and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
     be a very insufficient support therein.<eos>: 42.82844201333603
If I may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud."

"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_."

"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, "is a very common failing I believe.<eos>: 35.5057254135767
He will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before."

Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.

"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no
reason.<eos>: 34.86487471253909
But there
are two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am
ever to pay him."

"Money!<eos>: 75.08680116095965
She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.

The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary.<eos>: 54.89255721496892
Mr.
Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn
family; Jane heard them with horror.<eos>: 57.21996732888888
Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
     of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache
     there is not much the matter with me.

     "Yours, &c."

"Well, my dear," said Mr.<eos>: 35.30465520284891
On entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
decided.<eos>: 52.73524749835142
It was possible, however,
that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more
information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the
application was a something to look forward to.

Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected.<eos>: 48.57422220574126
The party then gathered
round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow.<eos>: 106.62340692235011
You supposed more than
     really existed.<eos>: 40.69539527314089
The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.

The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next
morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.<eos>: 82.70523830920804
Things are settled so
oddly."

"You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate."

"Ah!<eos>: 26.82176365587347
Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs.<eos>: 13.786335073388729
Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs.<eos>: 14.231145026079897
He was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.<eos>: 32.98624628217992
The
wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions,
may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a
joke."

"Certainly," replied Elizabeth--"there are such people, but I hope I am
not one of _them_.<eos>: 56.0134252711948
That among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of
his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling.<eos>: 84.60337615536592
Darcy may
perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would
hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr.<eos>: 39.96913772288466
Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my
     sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot
     help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a
     strong inducement.<eos>: 44.83472239785367
Bromley, of course.--If you mention my name at the Bell,
you will be attended to."

Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,
which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so
occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.<eos>: 63.59587761686955
She was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before.<eos>: 41.03981953497942
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were
     all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was
     gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,
     with Wickham!--Imagine our surprise.<eos>: 103.30753867710551
Wickham has created, a
     suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his
     real character.<eos>: 66.4641742709191
Darcy then
was.<eos>: 22.16000546016449
Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.<eos>: 20.560681418951145
Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.

"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever
lived.<eos>: 50.82784584566272
When
     she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;
     she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said
     not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so
     altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly
     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.<eos>: 62.582543014258405
That such a
consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far
enough from my thoughts."

"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I
suppose, to believe them fond of each other."

"Not the slightest.<eos>: 49.39724529281949
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert.<eos>: 52.939246322171876
They are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?<eos>: 23.918329281845963
Bennet, and, therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before,

"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.<eos>: 31.959949797352664
But above all, above respect and esteem,
there was a motive within her of good will which could not be
overlooked.<eos>: 90.27074348639565
Collins
was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.
Sir William did not say much.<eos>: 58.64788341635057
He is not at all liked in
Hertfordshire.<eos>: 42.732144232854715
Next to
being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.
It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among
her companions.<eos>: 81.9471363570642
how I laughed!<eos>: 45.705171631420434
She is
a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but
I will _make_ her know it."

"Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam," cried Mr.<eos>: 30.58627889429112
Elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr.<eos>: 55.712961075168984
The separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.<eos>: 41.981577030460336
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn
on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
Thursday with me.<eos>: 51.35330097137379
Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of
his uncle, Lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when
Mr.<eos>: 66.27415797252006
Kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and Mrs.<eos>: 29.265371781516958
Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,

"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn.<eos>: 40.966496910327315
Collins could be
forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by
Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten.

She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.<eos>: 44.652017826831106
But still he would be her husband.--Without thinking highly
either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it
was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small
fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their
pleasantest preservative from want.<eos>: 120.76945617847845
They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve.<eos>: 47.852852719884986
dear Lizzy, only
consider what he must have suffered.<eos>: 32.83942904753775
I rather wished, than
     believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to
     accede to his proposal.<eos>: 45.289442867644105
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life."

"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.<eos>: 57.26127227319215
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
They
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.

Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view.<eos>: 57.64521714346754
had I known what
I ought, what I dared, to do!<eos>: 51.47180213094932
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.

Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.
This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part.

His plan did not vary on seeing them.--Miss Bennet's lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
choice.<eos>: 59.712259872455036
Elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,

"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.<eos>: 37.358769950263984
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
After discharging
his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many
rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither
he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,
he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men.

Mr.<eos>: 51.00432222241215
Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma?<eos>: 48.382697786179804
Bennet's curiosity; and
Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.

The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.

"Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room."

She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell
her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held.<eos>: 34.72367202165671
You refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.<eos>: 53.370368453107034
For, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof.<eos>: 33.75324450006293
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
She likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved."

While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--Such formidable accounts of
her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,
who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her
introduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had
done to his presentation at St.<eos>: 72.50811848716091
Colonel
Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of
love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself
seriously to work to find it out.--She watched him whenever they were at
Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success.<eos>: 54.949065871925264
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said
how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his
other engagements might allow him to visit them.

"My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you
may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible."

They were all astonished; and Mr.<eos>: 37.14294267608856
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,
merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new
comers.<eos>: 102.42310783679429
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
She lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.

On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined
with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some
enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she
mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr.<eos>: 73.08285839690551
shocking!" cried Miss Bingley.<eos>: 15.440534685063293
I roused, and
interested you, because I was so unlike _them_.<eos>: 42.04702908213508
"You forget that I have made no
answer.<eos>: 21.205117998859002
It would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the
day."

"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be
near so much like a ball."

Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room.<eos>: 54.827157488824916
Bingley and Jane!" was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs.<eos>: 65.00403174417582
It is Mr.<eos>: 8.675459021808681
By all that I have
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary.<eos>: 50.390360334979945
Bennet replied that he had not.

"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs.<eos>: 21.30594164585212
While Sir William was with them, Mr.<eos>: 16.867421585329986
Bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought
only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin.<eos>: 79.11573848898206
There is nothing extravagant in _their_
housekeeping, I dare say."

"No, nothing at all."

"A great deal of good management, depend upon it.<eos>: 24.807573933300244
Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed
how really happy he was.

Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter and said,

"Jane, I congratulate you.<eos>: 65.63061318301504
Poor little Lizzy!<eos>: 31.24618227558416
If this be the case, he deserves you.<eos>: 38.04934756913854
But we are all liable to
error.<eos>: 23.31173128949875
Collins made his
declaration in form.<eos>: 47.95267473327538
Elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made.

Mrs.<eos>: 29.31492587646757
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him!<eos>: 85.36114759428419
Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures,
over the mantle-piece.<eos>: 38.42778963743032
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably
well, when she came into the room this morning.<eos>: 58.476416884858835
No, never.<eos>: 45.36954566873003
Smiles decked the face of Mrs.<eos>: 12.718542377545829
Bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of
this sad business of Jane's?<eos>: 53.15300638564262
You know my mother's ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends.<eos>: 36.18588677052758
Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at
Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him.<eos>: 58.18148573499816
He answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,
that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.<eos>: 41.485073616320484
She
had ventured only one glance at Darcy.<eos>: 98.08989289368807
His temptation is
not adequate to the risk."

"Do you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.

"Upon my word," said Mrs.<eos>: 27.38675642618747
But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter, depended on the will of the parents.<eos>: 44.45637781090747
There was no help
for it however.<eos>: 52.61158808967207
It was first broken by Mrs.<eos>: 25.498905763504386
Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and
Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who she observed to Mrs.<eos>: 50.36926094703156
If she heard me,
     it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen.<eos>: 21.235329654164435
In short,
I will do my best."

"Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very
often.<eos>: 35.167013153213006
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents.<eos>: 68.05074002746271
He has the
     promise of an ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in
     the North.<eos>: 50.37699325694442
Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend.<eos>: 27.898480988561175
You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here
with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be
dissuaded from it.<eos>: 45.36809081327537
His regiment is there; for I suppose you
have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the
regulars.<eos>: 31.319891616990255
It is highly improper.<eos>: 13.78385038699599
I hardly know how Mr.<eos>: 12.621583093842604
And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater
beauty.<eos>: 29.599775548167496
I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of
his constancy.<eos>: 48.551502162599654
When the first
transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were
over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.<eos>: 38.347329630688925
When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."

"That is to say, you had given your permission.<eos>: 30.5441373518225
Bingley met them with hopes
that Mrs.<eos>: 28.240860234565837
Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had
no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an
intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.

The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
but think, and think with wonder, of Mr.<eos>: 55.033618375592916
The supposition did not pain her.<eos>: 31.957234678765822
He still loves me, and we are
engaged."

Jane looked at her doubtingly.<eos>: 33.88013802080473
Believe her to be deceived by all means.
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."

"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere?"

"You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth, "and if upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by
all means to refuse him."

"How can you talk so?"--said Jane faintly smiling,--"You must know that
though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
not hesitate."

"I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider
your situation with much compassion."

"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required.<eos>: 50.65273600627163
I am no
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous
elopement.<eos>: 27.25417574221893
They must all go to Brighton.<eos>: 18.50116688729822
The general prejudice against Mr.<eos>: 37.96738894237493
Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with
some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing
at one end of the room.

Mr.<eos>: 68.78996185360111
You ought certainly to forgive them as
a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names
to be mentioned in your hearing." "_That_ is his notion of christian
forgiveness!<eos>: 60.810768003095
He has not an ill-natured
look.<eos>: 33.55582878930578
A regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it.<eos>: 111.39682424805682
Collins were once silent.<eos>: 30.588166222512363
The turn of your countenance I shall never
forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible
way, that would induce you to accept me."

"Oh!<eos>: 41.501322858004016
Lady Catherine had been rendered so
exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that
Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over.<eos>: 35.989734460104394
The note was immediately dispatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with.<eos>: 59.46996195560439
You must write again very
     soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.<eos>: 61.169511754906175
It was
the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in
the neighbourhood were drooping apace.<eos>: 23.73138526605831
my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.
Pray do not talk of that odious man.<eos>: 33.884012793446885
Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.--If it
be not so, let Mr.<eos>: 64.17735434580491
I am sincerely grieved for him and
     Mrs.<eos>: 31.373417277830892
Bingley's being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon
cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.

"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country.<eos>: 28.08740185565186
But I will endeavour to banish every painful
     thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,
     and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.<eos>: 54.324567317635086
This is the last time I shall ever
remember it myself."

Miss Bennet still looked all amazement.<eos>: 80.74339738785812
Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention
all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me
leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,
and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear."

"I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.

"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried Colonel
Fitzwilliam.<eos>: 43.94016693245633
You may imagine what I felt
     and how I acted.<eos>: 46.349281968162934
She had very little notice from any but him.<eos>: 75.58858893933707
I am
afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr.<eos>: 33.29345301923723
She had been graciously pleased to
approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her.<eos>: 26.75366635761382
I am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline
them."

"I am not now to learn," replied Mr.<eos>: 24.51372620813151
Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more
effectually to what they related?<eos>: 54.1819248548857
On the contrary she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband.--It was very strange that he should come
to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome.--She hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable.<eos>: 62.772960110653806
The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs.<eos>: 37.64685375463503
Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as
she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
take it on myself."

The girls stared at their father.<eos>: 64.98825755869521
His air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal.<eos>: 34.14563152201489
A lively imagination soon settled it all.

About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up
stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.<eos>: 68.01941857375724
Much as I abominate
writing, I would not give up Mr.<eos>: 28.61108121631572
no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr.<eos>: 26.422549579868072
Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at
Netherfield long enough.<eos>: 70.51861152878872
And is it really true?<eos>: 96.03428889997788
Oh, Lydia!"

"I comfort myself with thinking," replied Jane, "that he certainly would
not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her.<eos>: 34.26593679869036
But
her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means
satisfy Mr.<eos>: 76.49654453144824
Philips,
appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use
to the late Mr.<eos>: 43.99563875413716
Collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr.<eos>: 28.1405557962529
"The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved
in civility."

"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.<eos>: 36.2153025943783
Her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,

"I can guess the subject of your reverie."

"I should imagine not."

"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.
I was never more annoyed!<eos>: 41.0300236797182
But
I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."

From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr.<eos>: 60.63987991903311
Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection.<eos>: 39.29664133211708
On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her
for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.<eos>: 32.52243576932121
The second began.<eos>: 43.36921389577756
With his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.

If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity
unblemished could make him.<eos>: 66.32242187569292
"Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in
my dressing-room."

Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawing-room.

Mrs.<eos>: 37.01086082384466
You must contrive to send
somebody.<eos>: 25.350616434981603
Bennet had been down stairs, but on this
happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high.<eos>: 47.239973100667235
And
what do you think she said besides?<eos>: 39.10690527929042
To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs.<eos>: 32.234238981078455
He has heartily forgiven me
now."

Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr.<eos>: 37.89997961551755
And so, you like this man's sisters too,
do you?<eos>: 68.34950489994786
"What do you think?<eos>: 12.610494263671827
She had only to say in
reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
knowledge.<eos>: 33.82471899810806
It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind.

She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.

In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
Colonel Fitzwilliam.<eos>: 62.44001954831359
Perhaps he had been civil, only because he
felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was
not like ease.<eos>: 60.679081762678294
More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please
than when they last met, were plainly expressed.<eos>: 71.13567780802204
A clergyman like you must marry.--Chuse properly, chuse a
gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way.<eos>: 120.20837111297234
She had
gained her point, and had time to consider of it.<eos>: 32.8067540249283
Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an
interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them.<eos>: 46.73987364426951
Collins, you
must marry.<eos>: 16.987835491894263
They could
not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known,
would not have recognised it for Mr.<eos>: 40.32574439644378
What could your ladyship propose by it?"

"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."

"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth,
coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report
is in existence."

"If!<eos>: 41.57523782145863
She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said,

"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
Netherfield?--I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not
some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure."

"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses,
before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and
as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my
cards."

"I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.<eos>: 52.83022863146551
I should never be happy without
     him, so think it no harm to be off.<eos>: 43.51221537590669
In
talking over their route the evening before, Mrs.<eos>: 33.48318956473756
Charlotte had seen
them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running
into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,

"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.<eos>: 53.567333728840865
Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
Mr.<eos>: 24.26547539065853
She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.

"Haye-Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings would quit it, or the
great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is
too far off!<eos>: 54.32497922599781
Another day I will do the same; I will sit in
my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble
as I can,--or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away."

"I am not going to run away, Papa," said Kitty, fretfully; "if _I_
should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia."

"_You_ go to Brighton!--I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne
for fifty pounds!<eos>: 55.435110984245576
Wickham and the
officers, Mr.<eos>: 13.454052039568605
"But to expose
the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present
feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.<eos>: 57.08186707931283

London:
Printed for T.<eos>: 54.11219742577143
But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on
them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.

With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.<eos>: 43.64945612970222
my dear Charlotte,--impossible!"

The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon
regained her composure, and calmly replied,

"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible
that Mr.<eos>: 61.10436371337864
Bennet sat looking and winking at
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them.<eos>: 78.55110554910955
Darcy?--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing."

Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.<eos>: 62.44859117669685
Gardiner and
her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.

By Mrs.<eos>: 26.65401538854119
There is no talk of his
coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every
body too, who is likely to know."

"I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more."

"Oh, well!<eos>: 32.736337006598994
On the
gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.

Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.<eos>: 70.14157695597505
but the gentlemen will have Mr.<eos>: 19.913850025694774
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!"

"Oh!<eos>: 16.298716393472326
And their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew
her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
the North.<eos>: 29.134870695368296
I do not deserve it.<eos>: 12.270236527969415
Though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced.<eos>: 61.907638406787775
It does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."

"Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."

"I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a
studier of character.<eos>: 45.62247031403524
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated
elopement.<eos>: 32.303143502844
Bennet could not give her consent, or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
Mr.<eos>: 54.22821944779337
But don't imagine it was from
any silly cause.<eos>: 55.450468628073295
You may remember
what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it."

They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him,
she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,

"Come, Mr.<eos>: 40.61385056979167
Gardiner abused her stupidity.<eos>: 10.235731631197071
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.
     Yours ever,

     "CAROLINE BINGLEY."

"With the officers!" cried Lydia.<eos>: 67.95183866895215
Wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr.<eos>: 44.22133996984713
Your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage.<eos>: 96.6888447440612
A report of a most
alarming nature, reached me two days ago.<eos>: 70.61065854695325
A flirt too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of
her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.<eos>: 59.614596371257456
Everything wore
a happier aspect.<eos>: 13.995290119646642
I knew that Mr.<eos>: 8.88202718527907
Lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won, and Mr.<eos>: 23.415678406240254
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed
the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs.<eos>: 27.374968985052718
Thank Heaven!<eos>: 14.495698740840888
Gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind.

He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn.<eos>: 43.189268293379115
I am only ashamed of his asking so little."

"And they _must_ marry!<eos>: 42.71648098555435
Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.<eos>: 36.29446347686235
If you are a good
girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of
them."




CHAPTER VII.


Two days after Mr.<eos>: 37.38558675295725
That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe
possible.<eos>: 58.74228993412504
But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at
the will of others.<eos>: 88.74310280702277
They stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she
returned to his civil enquiries after her family.<eos>: 66.16156258847286
I will put on my things in a moment.<eos>: 43.270171195926174
Vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonimously.<eos>: 79.3293545920376
Bingley's
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.

Mrs.<eos>: 25.915071833227785
It was some days, however, before they
received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the
house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,
almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening.<eos>: 48.47474518163806
I am very glad
you liked her.<eos>: 23.91609965396279
Secondly, that I am convinced it will add
very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have
mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation
of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this
subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left
Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs.<eos>: 66.29926183373193
Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.<eos>: 22.192096317428074
He had not been long seated
before he complimented Mrs.<eos>: 38.450751480173885
Their table was superlatively stupid.<eos>: 14.641791222242313
Darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the _appearance_ of what is right.<eos>: 58.79152102653426
Gardiner, though unknown.<eos>: 37.104808248217104
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance!<eos>: 18.219810952154056
A
most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House!<eos>: 290.5194236440921
Forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your
confidante."




CHAPTER XIII.


A few days after this visit, Mr.<eos>: 37.341799049369456
_I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe, united."

Mrs.<eos>: 94.76547843588487
He observed to her, at a
moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had
something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had
the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "It
is above eight months.<eos>: 53.074436599828616
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
His surprise was great.<eos>: 32.33780756754427
He confessed himself
     obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,
     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the
     ill-consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone.<eos>: 46.143817747649976
It would be such a delicious scheme,
and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all.<eos>: 30.536214554657835
That he should even speak to
her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her
family!<eos>: 51.25478214851203
Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
acquaintance.<eos>: 48.76860231021876
Collins's fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but
that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from
possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her
astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the
bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,

"Engaged to Mr.<eos>: 47.429959516155265
Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly;
"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.<eos>: 40.17992286977459
Gardiner.<eos>: 3.9410746666968075
Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.<eos>: 68.62484765049027
Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
but did not live to do it.--Mr.<eos>: 45.79868526563759
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
and Mrs.<eos>: 3.8891635654619057
Gardiner.<eos>: 3.9410746666968075
I am afraid you will not be able to make
     it out, but I hardly know what I have written."

Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.

     "By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried
     letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not
     confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer
     for being coherent.<eos>: 55.04540181279854
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer
the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for Mr.<eos>: 47.88841178759521
I am
     sure you will be very comfortable there.

     "Your's, &c."

This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.<eos>: 64.04974228830812
If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."

"What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.
Darcy had much better finish his letter."

Mr.<eos>: 32.81863732468038
But the morrow
passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs.<eos>: 47.344010275807854
Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.<eos>: 51.95742960747396
I believe I have now told you every thing.
     It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I
     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.<eos>: 46.848252196145275
Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching
the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister.<eos>: 44.20392138675762
But our visitor
     was very obstinate.<eos>: 24.660225499710105
Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's.<eos>: 44.04850919190535
Bennet's visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library.<eos>: 31.61810000914373
He knows where we live.<eos>: 72.37239407506269
Has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"

"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."

"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason.<eos>: 38.86863664148694
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?<eos>: 37.91893839379181
She will follow wherever Lydia leads.<eos>: 59.36805386797179
Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.<eos>: 52.72734803167267
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.
She answered him with cold civility.<eos>: 88.33824350571754
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o'clock.<eos>: 43.16321460523234
Not a word passed
between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr.<eos>: 94.16875308471661
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly
relieved.<eos>: 60.2376550283919
Wickham had resolved
on quitting the Militia.

     "It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon
     as his marriage was fixed on.<eos>: 47.15153335051688
He called it, therefore, his duty to step
     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on
     by himself.<eos>: 37.17634031032571
Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.<eos>: 49.72319150680051
His affection for
her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in
spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her.

Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for
Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.<eos>: 44.088244339895695
Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teazing?"

"I honour your circumspection.<eos>: 43.398442510522145
It is every way horrible!"

Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.

"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--Oh!<eos>: 65.56429422731824
What praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant?<eos>: 67.35515213891462
Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.<eos>: 57.807608957576605
His character is thereby complete."

"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.<eos>: 40.009046603896216
In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his
     studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all
     restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.<eos>: 57.872453364816685
Whilst wandering on in this
slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was
quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr.<eos>: 26.28239234045544
"I have just had a letter from
Jane, with such dreadful news.<eos>: 46.07757312963646
He really
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger.

Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.

She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.

"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
the officers.--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses."

"Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"

"Oh!<eos>: 58.62135048962903
Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling.

"He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
partner?"

Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.<eos>: 45.91390257708517
It has been my own doing,
and I ought to feel it."

"You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth.

"You may well warn me against such an evil.<eos>: 29.39292808335344
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep
his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her."

Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very
little disposed to approve them.<eos>: 49.21150969977964
The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants.<eos>: 46.897425117756036
Her own thoughts were employing her.<eos>: 34.33619093896594
Bennet spent the
morning together, as had been agreed on.<eos>: 44.15456848857375
Bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem.

"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he.<eos>: 66.68000199962276
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never
     disgrace him.<eos>: 23.562691000213874
She saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct.<eos>: 28.77124184187699
I told him, moreover, that I believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."

Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend.

"Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"

"From the former.<eos>: 44.83934742853467
He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great!<eos>: 55.83521148215757
He was very fond of them."

This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr.<eos>: 28.648843082164387
Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor
agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be
imaginary.<eos>: 45.51904447793983
How Mr.<eos>: 3.007391752405174
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to
her eldest sister, "Ah!<eos>: 50.88264595532692
Many of my acquaintance are
already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest
friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I
despair.<eos>: 45.89220160554118
Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of
that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree
with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard
Mr.<eos>: 35.2114576955311
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your
advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though
in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and
habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like
yourself." And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.<eos>: 79.95514627700804
And with regard to the
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's
concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn."

"And this is your real opinion!<eos>: 43.08034397267023
Five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.
Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he
would.<eos>: 36.85921545375383
But I am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a
circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
could."

"Would Mr.<eos>: 55.07447566225796
But gracious me!
I quite forgot!<eos>: 162.68509054874428
But he found, in reply to
     this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more
     effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.
     Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof
     against the temptation of immediate relief.<eos>: 61.19579881988081
They look upon it
quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens."

"It was a subject which they could not mention before me."

"No.<eos>: 43.20432245137184
You must not disappoint your father."

"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."

"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."

"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.<eos>: 28.2476930897181
If _I_ can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to
discover it too."

"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do."

"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
it, he must find it out."

"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.<eos>: 41.679981623896545
For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.
Darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse."

It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.

"I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she.<eos>: 27.470485081002813
These parties were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think, than such as did not.

Wickham's affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to
find it; not equal to Lydia's for him.<eos>: 88.31807679556971
My reasons for
believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand
is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would
be any other than highly desirable.<eos>: 84.86240558040765
Darcy.<eos>: 5.0362465464125075
Darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.<eos>: 53.64702964376768
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the
name of your admirer.<eos>: 38.65392367882491
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a
wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the
two eldest.<eos>: 63.256877866436305
This
however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with
Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she
had often great enjoyment out of doors.<eos>: 72.92510240052775
She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been
lost.

"My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street."

She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.
"I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to London.<eos>: 42.235101546751196
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.<eos>: 53.8552156829631
Mrs.
Reynolds could interest her on no other point.<eos>: 51.215388515512295
Well, Monday morning came, and I was in
such a fuss!<eos>: 54.89441740305465
To be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of Mr.<eos>: 58.18374520911046
I cannot be
     otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your
     amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to
     assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but
     of this hereafter.<eos>: 68.47110204905886
She felt anew the justice of Mr.<eos>: 15.24728852989679
When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it, of which officers Mr.<eos>: 60.0731220014674
It must be an amusing study."

"Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.<eos>: 21.713253208348657
But so they always are.<eos>: 72.39839945068104
Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be
delayed; I have not an instant to lose."

"Good God!<eos>: 100.69026108824634
Bingley, whose blind partiality
provoked her.

But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to
the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
notice.<eos>: 36.39440532917671
Darcy's
regard."

"Mr.<eos>: 10.035925501086739
I
_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."

"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added
Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."

"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.<eos>: 37.75608555236574
There is a lady, it seems, a
     Mrs.<eos>: 34.09092016529809
Bingley will dance with you at the next
ball."

"Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the
youngest, I'm the tallest."

The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return Mr.<eos>: 34.514274806024495
Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.

"Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky."

He should be particularly happy at any time, &c.<eos>: 40.48268988760449
_I_ only
want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.<eos>: 86.86591222633612
What is to become of us!<eos>: 30.86012067849616
We must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect.<eos>: 32.390243572015564
Darcy."

"He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.
"But so we all do.<eos>: 35.413025224340466
That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice!<eos>: 72.81210394833093
To know
that her daughter would be married was enough.<eos>: 29.404761686719294
He was as generous, she
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex.<eos>: 51.35748922424571
Bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, "if that disagreeable Mr.<eos>: 41.41456941709711
His understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.<eos>: 38.16330881360791
As for my fair cousins,
though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall
now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting
my cousin Elizabeth."

With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.<eos>: 108.43974975074958
Bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.<eos>: 53.218482042350026
Her mother's ungraciousness,
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;
and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell
him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
the family.

She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.<eos>: 43.53482133557815
I wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.<eos>: 68.9497686530741
His fear of her, has always operated, I
know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his
wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he
has very much at heart."

Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head.<eos>: 35.69829208779087
"It must not be thought of.<eos>: 22.105186576915095
Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing Mr.<eos>: 38.91661027075985
and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said
a word about it till now."

"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr.<eos>: 33.060862286721246
She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her."

"It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends."

"An easy distance do you call it?<eos>: 49.241960934585194
To persuade him against
     returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,
     was scarcely the work of a moment.--I cannot blame myself for
     having done thus much.<eos>: 72.15721047860028
After this period, every
     appearance of acquaintance was dropt.<eos>: 34.26965718855041
The two youngest of the family,
Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing
better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt.<eos>: 90.40385710599456
Bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his
having slighted one of her daughters.

Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.<eos>: 47.38883666243609
Without supposing
them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she
resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left
Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment.

To Mrs.<eos>: 44.303670242675025
Those who do not complain are never
pitied."

Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any
attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.
She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
they were joined by Mr.<eos>: 73.64390699994371
Within doors there
was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be
always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day.<eos>: 55.509889018666215
You have delighted us long enough.
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."

Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to.

"If I," said Mr.<eos>: 60.308684773093226
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy."

"Are you, indeed?<eos>: 20.561614846454887
Towards _him_ I have been
kinder than towards myself."

Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.

"But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike
is founded.<eos>: 44.71975231479172
I wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set downs.<eos>: 25.859279620777293
But you are always giving _her_ the
preference."

"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters."

"Mr.<eos>: 61.92936542337929
I know it to be impossible."

"This is a wretched beginning indeed!<eos>: 27.760090567079313
How strange must it appear to him!<eos>: 58.251938698379526
Darcy than they had before any idea of;
it was evident that he was very much in love with her.<eos>: 29.837436815848886
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or
rather taller."

"How I long to see her again!<eos>: 41.711940461102216
We seem to have been designed for each
other."

Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.<eos>: 54.66931117886887
Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's
pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.
Philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the
invitation.

Mrs.<eos>: 31.009070884198778
Bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
herself.<eos>: 51.246428226763044
my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately.
Consider how important every moment is, in such a case."

"Let me write for you," said Jane, "if you dislike the trouble
yourself."

"I dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done."

And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.

"And may I ask?" said Elizabeth, "but the terms, I suppose, must be
complied with."

"Complied with!<eos>: 37.00309137232654
Have all her friends left her?"

"Mrs.<eos>: 22.099296351933358
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted
only regimentals to make him completely charming.<eos>: 57.41210618550327
On opening the door, she perceived her
sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of
both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would
have told it all.<eos>: 64.03764651269941
She was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper.<eos>: 83.84826628862315
After
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss
Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
enquiry after the health of her family.<eos>: 49.958198744858116
Bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and
addressed herself particularly to Mr.<eos>: 47.553830126709464
My father supported him at school, and
     afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own
     father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have
     been unable to give him a gentleman's education.<eos>: 38.1609386389073
Bingley does not know the whole of his
history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended Mr.<eos>: 38.61845009861908
Bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"

"I advise Mr.<eos>: 60.31113128927671
Bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight."

"But my father cannot.--He wrote last week to hurry my return."

"Oh!<eos>: 80.33695577689647
By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.<eos>: 82.7887997853791
This letter is from Mr.<eos>: 21.294278834686132
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
And his behaviour, so
strikingly altered,--what could it mean?<eos>: 65.1905122604175
I
hope he will overlook it.<eos>: 11.052015124705767
Do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition."

"Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."

"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"

Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
Catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a
moment's deliberation,

"I am not."

Lady Catherine seemed pleased.

"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"

"I will make no promise of the kind."

"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.<eos>: 46.2890142334176
In a doleful voice Mrs.<eos>: 18.28626949247565
"They
will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr.<eos>: 62.68716862754072
Lady Catherine it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.
Darcy.<eos>: 52.223907536493094
Bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this
instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did
not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but
Mrs.<eos>: 64.6074368901011
To the rest of the family they paid little attention;
avoiding Mrs.<eos>: 33.912504508612265
Bingley will not be detained in London by
them."

"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
Hertfordshire this winter.<eos>: 47.80049050735767
Bingley and his sisters came to give their
personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was
fixed for the following Tuesday.<eos>: 67.70127558313722
Long has just been here, and she
told me all about it."

Mr.<eos>: 31.408074728154396
But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.<eos>: 42.75475424029125
While
she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.<eos>: 61.263726051197004
Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the
compliment must be all for herself.<eos>: 62.37528504998941
Bennet: one
communication would, therefore, do for all.<eos>: 86.90347097362866
Their society can afford no pleasure,
that will atone for such wretchedness as this!<eos>: 65.85025595636388
Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned
back.<eos>: 40.74769885539493
There was
another reason too for her opposition.<eos>: 35.64150103669014
They had frequently been staying with her in town.

The first part of Mrs.<eos>: 24.06713922348367
_Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she
thought was still worse.<eos>: 78.29308395703268
Your ladyship wants Mr.<eos>: 19.6940562567693
Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?<eos>: 26.34543897338319
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had
such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself.<eos>: 104.80269385192709
It is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side."

"Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business?--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody."

"Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion.<eos>: 70.61816904932756
Darcy, only for a few minutes to take
leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found.--Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in
missing him; she really rejoiced at it.<eos>: 60.36053483890412
Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.<eos>: 47.43290758454245
Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits.<eos>: 52.48505999413318
Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn,
and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though
he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have
two full courses.




CHAPTER XXII.


The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the
chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr.<eos>: 51.39829342825735
Darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--You
cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you."
And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr.<eos>: 50.8671664987843
Console Lady Catherine as well as
     you can.<eos>: 32.67926658957238
Do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the
truth from her heart."

"You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable."

To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.




CHAPTER XX.


Mr.<eos>: 59.766982998345256
But,
my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of
being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."

"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your
representation of all this, might make me quite easy.<eos>: 54.28411246429186
Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified.<eos>: 26.108900641621467
Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me?<eos>: 73.9311231242585
No look appeared
on either side that spoke particular regard.<eos>: 184.75874339320703
Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm

1.E.7.<eos>: 9.486881287011965
Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well
married, I shall have nothing to wish for."

In a few days Mr.<eos>: 40.101984295483796
She had been unwilling to
mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend.<eos>: 31.297836879912467
She saw instantly that her
cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility
was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate
to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family.<eos>: 65.04099495387915
What are men
to rocks and mountains?<eos>: 27.29408115054448
Gardiner, who was
walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her
wonder.<eos>: 36.74672949945333
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined
and unvarying society."

"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever."

"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs.<eos>: 52.92145338544658
They then went away.

Mrs.<eos>: 13.40939259929675
As soon as Jane had read Mr.<eos>: 25.57803498739036
However, he
wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were."

"And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently.<eos>: 32.700642349299024
It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.<eos>: 46.37031712634735
She was now in an irritation as violent from
delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation.<eos>: 34.58501877914047
Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of
course familiar with--'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and I
shall keep mine to swell my song."

Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.<eos>: 75.38545524056416
We have not met since the 26th of November, when
we were all dancing together at Netherfield."

Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,
whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn.<eos>: 47.58083474920444
The insipidity and yet the noise; the
nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--What would
I give to hear your strictures on them!"

"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.<eos>: 64.74213022799194
Darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice?<eos>: 163.3628562182345
His cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in
his pleasure.

By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr.<eos>: 60.28080190780877
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
and in the evening Mrs.<eos>: 29.878297531885217
She turned from sister to sister, demanding their
congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
there.

Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners
were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.<eos>: 69.8534014115548
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
He has been accused of many
     faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one.<eos>: 59.97280407155757
My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much
as I might have done!<eos>: 33.008971023326694
The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to
the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the
door.<eos>: 48.910371030552575
Upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward.<eos>: 32.51863893986716
Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"

But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect
of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished
her all imaginable happiness.

"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte,--"you must be
surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr.<eos>: 42.6688962652305
The officers will find
women better worth their notice.<eos>: 109.0034704283466
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were
discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.
They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every
thing but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs.<eos>: 53.58076604704458
Darcy afterwards discharged.

As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than
the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and
she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out.<eos>: 66.19574572660828

PRIDE & PREJUDICE.




CHAPTER I.


It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
property of some one or other of their daughters.

"My dear Mr.<eos>: 67.49528539440605
Only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have!"

"Yes," thought Elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,
and completely do for us at once.<eos>: 55.19446308740038
I know how much
you dislike him."

"You know nothing of the matter.<eos>: 27.54691614539501
Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr.<eos>: 39.149498749384094
But these things happen so often!<eos>: 98.98070446633542
Ten thousand a year!<eos>: 34.594503603208466
How odious I should think them!"

"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours."

"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her."

"I have already told her so once, by your desire."

"I am afraid you do not like your pen.<eos>: 37.38597739782503
The dear
colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year.<eos>: 162.11787995778633
Collins
had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy
together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.<eos>: 29.590653135352692
The reason of this sudden
removal was soon evident.<eos>: 67.07254718757672
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball.<eos>: 45.222475657421725
She had always seen it with pain; but
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children, was so highly reprehensible.<eos>: 39.49871973794634
In the hall they parted.




CHAPTER XVII.


"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question
which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and
from all the others when they sat down to table.<eos>: 35.39007090811404
Miss Bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense.

"I see your design, Bingley," said his friend.--"You dislike an
argument, and want to silence this."

"Perhaps I do.<eos>: 66.93796586137516
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty.
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.<eos>: 53.761681116365395
Bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.--But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.<eos>: 60.01106258954465
She seldom listened to any
body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.

In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to
Meryton and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed
the scheme.<eos>: 52.83793947084595
she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!<eos>: 51.522088540901166
But they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them.<eos>: 30.04156797763973
Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from
their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if
she had not happened to see Mr.<eos>: 51.652056083173036
You will not find
him more favourably spoken of by any one."

"I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short
interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen.<eos>: 37.92467416037222
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
The Project Gutenberg eBook, Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, Edited
by R.<eos>: 25.752091087640355
And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
about this report?<eos>: 65.2797368880876
Your
     father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they
     had a great deal of talk together.<eos>: 41.76664922146763
Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely
more." Then addressing her daughter, "Oh!<eos>: 57.13737648052211
Philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.<eos>: 36.2929869986823
Elizabeth, equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.

Mrs.<eos>: 58.894620200372444
They were soon gone again, rising from
their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs.<eos>: 61.04439021644287
She could not help frequently
glancing her eye at Mr.<eos>: 25.864486181150514
Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family.<eos>: 27.902227952278654
His
attachment to Rosings, certainly increases."

Mr.<eos>: 37.4064635397903
Her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady
Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.

"She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."

"She is a very fine-looking woman!<eos>: 45.66096680991231
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of
selecting a wife, as I certainly did."

The idea of Mr.<eos>: 59.294333042439
The feelings
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so
widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten.<eos>: 67.9985118833372
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's
situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch.<eos>: 37.60601792413102
Bennet could hardly
contain herself.<eos>: 33.27518646833288
His words
seemed to imply it.<eos>: 18.709567756656078
Bennet
say voluntarily to Elizabeth,

"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."

Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases
came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects
which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table,
after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs.<eos>: 78.15613663720956
They are
wanted in the farm, Mr.<eos>: 11.977240426869255
He immediately offered to fetch her
others; all that his library afforded.

"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more
than I ever look into."

Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.

"I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left
so small a collection of books.--What a delightful library you have at
Pemberley, Mr.<eos>: 56.65990202358617
Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
"is my master--and very like him.<eos>: 41.686519196840464
Bennet very dull for several days.

"I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with
one's friends.<eos>: 27.951700902550215
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place.<eos>: 50.96419679929439
He scarcely ever spoke to
her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend.

The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs.<eos>: 31.890678829897016
As it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery.<eos>: 38.58467003788376
But, luckily, he came back
again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.<eos>: 44.52850089679085
As they passed into other rooms, these objects were
taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to
be seen.<eos>: 77.62952703024803
But it ought to
be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done
directly."

"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.<eos>: 37.850646740968166
I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention;
the other is Charlotte's marriage.<eos>: 66.00731419343525
On both sides it was only assertion.<eos>: 30.88955887923071
He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again
     on Wednesday or Thursday.<eos>: 45.16911044417777
"Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare
that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she
is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she
suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to
put me on my guard?<eos>: 81.39413052212775
In the desperation
of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to
Elizabeth, said,

"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room.--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting
so long in one attitude."

Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.<eos>: 48.11667725397258
I
did not expect such a compliment."

"Did not you?<eos>: 22.34296655116302
Gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.<eos>: 40.55196519223379
To interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
she soon afterwards said,

"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having somebody at his disposal.<eos>: 65.05085194129309
Darcy has not made him just to you!--If from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for
dishonesty I must call it."

"It _is_ wonderful,"--replied Wickham,--"for almost all his actions may
be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend.<eos>: 68.32696988659707
Have you not heard me say, that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"

"Yes, and I had heard it before.<eos>: 40.92818710968811
yes--it would be much better to
wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter
would be at Meryton again.<eos>: 60.6382657732627
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance."

"I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match," cried Elizabeth.<eos>: 28.3174681752929
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer.<eos>: 43.97473101491385
Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can
assure you, he informed me himself."

"I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.
"Excuse my interference.--It was kindly meant."

"Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself.--"You are much mistaken if
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.<eos>: 44.60118148768663
You know I always
speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling
post by themselves.<eos>: 71.1587022211032
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make
     the latter probable.--If it be so, if I have been misled by such
     error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been
     unreasonable.<eos>: 55.94061629176576
GARDINER."

The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share.<eos>: 72.21081858221577
Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last?"

Mr.<eos>: 65.1678797271065
Bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same
principle."

"I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it up, as
soon as any eligible purchase offers."

Elizabeth made no answer.<eos>: 35.0119032495826
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her
being in Kent.<eos>: 47.83913044237713
If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.<eos>: 60.50679909981049
She is all affability and condescension, and I
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when
service is over.<eos>: 46.88777785831964
What a meeting for her, when she
first sees my aunt!"

"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said
Jane: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy.<eos>: 49.18220271671711
In his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her.<eos>: 54.60069045149638
Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in
default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his.<eos>: 45.639967748984496
Her mother's thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
venture near her, lest she might hear too much.<eos>: 52.39549045474678
Have you never
happened to see her there?"

She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the
Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.<eos>: 38.42315942584084
Elizabeth was surprised, but said
not a word.<eos>: 30.783045457202164
Yes, yes.<eos>: 12.697819459145135
She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.

"If he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "I shall give him up for
ever."

The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes; but, alas!<eos>: 40.32751509628961
She opened the
door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out,

"Oh, my dear Eliza!<eos>: 33.7681837806735
Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers.<eos>: 47.1374891420467
Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure.<eos>: 51.15379149626048
I write rather slowly."

"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the
year!<eos>: 44.419989525435156
"Wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well
as Jane's."




CHAPTER XVIII.


Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.
Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.<eos>: 40.825837242058384
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for
Mr.<eos>: 16.696090323024144
Though her manner
varied however, her determination never did.

Mr.<eos>: 48.372141698764906
"Having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs.<eos>: 91.53211520831441
She wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false!

the children.<eos>: 19.277566372107827
He bore it however with admirable calmness.<eos>: 32.872378962461944
_They_ will never be distressed
for money.<eos>: 44.50500874135653
Bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, "as ever I saw.<eos>: 25.635048083750597
Their manners are not equal to his."

"Certainly not; at first.<eos>: 61.332847250849404
It is because he will not give himself the trouble."

"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy,
"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.<eos>: 52.323152419329894
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
I am so
grieved for him.<eos>: 17.043771391464627
Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
Mr.<eos>: 26.162176905972373
But it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again.

With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.<eos>: 71.60252805712877
I
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish."

"My dear Mr.<eos>: 53.09022617991977
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected.<eos>: 49.072526733327116
She had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty.<eos>: 72.24086612506915
Bingley's carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.

The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on
Jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred.<eos>: 71.65711594385888
Collins has made
you an offer of marriage.<eos>: 31.362816161405654
Darcy was really the
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many
months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she
did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.

"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to
say.<eos>: 34.80297826986381
There was now employment for the whole
party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected
them round the table.

While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.<eos>: 42.41712853244098
Gardiner's hope of Lydia's
being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence
added to its exuberance.<eos>: 38.55214732124877

before her uncle and aunt's arrival.<eos>: 31.454802359257176

Professor Michael S.<eos>: 37.11388053328485
Every body said how well
she looked; and Mr.<eos>: 43.93305862613311
Lizzy is not a bit better than the
others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
good humoured as Lydia.<eos>: 39.77792205333494
Long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips."

"Are you quite sure, Ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?" said
Jane.--"I certainly saw Mr.<eos>: 82.7797907607129
She was sure they should be married some time or
     other, and it did not much signify when.<eos>: 50.24233697563278
I defy even Sir William Lucas
himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law."

The loss of her daughter made Mrs.<eos>: 73.42198287518914
Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her
hand; but in vain.<eos>: 52.37143843580645
The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to
     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are
     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.
     If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act
     in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will
     immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper
     settlement.<eos>: 71.16941556001606
Have you had any
flirting?<eos>: 27.053404870045597
"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him
at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and
warn me off his grounds."

Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said
nothing.

"From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs.<eos>: 63.258208354165184
They were ignorant, idle, and vain.<eos>: 35.870198351128614
"_You_ were Mr.<eos>: 17.3904600875867
Calling back
the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an
accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
mistress home, instantly.

On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
"Let me call your maid.<eos>: 44.633827603091525
Darcy is
engaged to _my daughter_.<eos>: 16.762700830841606
Every disposition of the ground was
good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered
on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace
it, with delight.<eos>: 27.363381857531373
Darcy.<eos>: 5.0362465464125075
Gardiner's
former residence, and where she had lately learned that some
acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen
all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of
Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated.<eos>: 49.97966113840114
Miss Darcy's praise occupied
the chief of it.<eos>: 18.382566124021402
But the case is
this.<eos>: 32.80256958658819
It was reasonable, however, to
hope, that they would not continue long.<eos>: 24.83661235640054
Their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest
blush.<eos>: 26.215406940199756
Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his
father's life time.

There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of
their acquaintance.<eos>: 30.699149518951895
Bennet followed her,
saying,

"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself.<eos>: 35.776747255214325
Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"

"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--Will you hear it?"

"Most willingly."

"You shall have it in few words.<eos>: 55.95118217362475
Collins.<eos>: 3.406007001821786
Darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
cousin's corroboration.

She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation
between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr.<eos>: 43.25201597858846
This
unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure
of seeing you at Pemberley to-day."

"Oh, yes.<eos>: 45.39325520253365
I will take care of
myself, and of Mr.<eos>: 18.118937026175907
It would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard."

"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,
he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!"

"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
modesty."

This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and
the little value he put on his own good qualities.

Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference
of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving
heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice
her against him.

"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried
Jane.<eos>: 47.22120130981593
It was consoling, that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush.<eos>: 37.00306848801803
Darcy.<eos>: 5.0362465464125075
Bingley's continued
absence.

Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.<eos>: 90.06044901956164
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of
thinking.<eos>: 69.21789845523186
I _must_ have employment and society.
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible.<eos>: 100.55366499722905
Their fortune on both
sides is splendid.<eos>: 58.444173598194254
Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in
     London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they
     would have taken up their abode with her.<eos>: 33.9448439794618
Darcy might have done as well."

"Mr.<eos>: 16.770666463271986
"It
would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.<eos>: 47.03967176207663
I am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is.<eos>: 27.627984404846003
I must beg to return to
the house."

And she rose as she spoke.<eos>: 40.37838817568244
Mary and Kitty, thank
Heaven!<eos>: 54.14117732200902
Bennet was not in the
habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five
set off together.<eos>: 62.05381472064717
Respect,
esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of
domestic happiness were overthrown.<eos>: 48.76645444419256
The officer was the very
Mr.<eos>: 35.94189392600773
We _will_ know where
we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.<eos>: 65.30447366048773
_That_ is all to be forgot.<eos>: 25.45431961925874
She knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
advantage.<eos>: 92.25098608672795
Lizzy declares she will not have Mr.<eos>: 16.855245106849434
&c."

Mr.<eos>: 14.630727584930979
He begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping
Lucases.<eos>: 73.73524642537446
I congratulate her.<eos>: 14.106275887379576
He
then said,

"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly.<eos>: 56.40335125186101
Their eyes
were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers,
and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin
in a shop window, could recal them.

But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way.<eos>: 54.037789330878866
Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall
all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding."

Mrs.<eos>: 28.056965818385805
But let me advise you to think better of it.<eos>: 27.79637714088118
Darcy, who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
knowing what she did, she accepted him.<eos>: 47.5557745614027
Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction.<eos>: 58.7194377586251
I know my dear uncle and
     aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have
     still something more to ask of the former.<eos>: 31.361551885550416
Charlotte is an
excellent manager, I dare say.<eos>: 23.850512014490683
When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling
in love as much as she chuses."

"Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.<eos>: 39.93416780448773
He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure
_I_ never want to see him again.<eos>: 27.933585522378586
The
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this.<eos>: 51.286660514785204
Collins joining
in, observed,

"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine
de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will
be delighted with her.<eos>: 35.67669590047375
Bingley to _her_."

"Impossible, Mr.<eos>: 23.43808187678083
Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together.<eos>: 32.694187302597534
I hope you have destroyed the letter.<eos>: 13.776657401340376
They were able to love each
other, even as well as they intended.<eos>: 42.167766189065134
Widely
different was the effect of a second perusal.--How could she deny that
credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally
unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help
remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been.--Neither could she
deny the justice of his description of Jane.--She felt that Jane's
feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a
constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great
sensibility.

When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
of shame was severe.<eos>: 57.831491525285024
Had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!<eos>: 122.63067255181724
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?"

"Oh, yes!<eos>: 25.0405529689806
what's his name.<eos>: 50.969999817130336
It is nearly fifty miles."

"And what is fifty miles of good road?<eos>: 54.770235624034754
I will not tell you what it is.<eos>: 18.38374913808735
I have not a doubt of your
doing very well together.<eos>: 31.604808578496957
A
little time therefore.--I shall certainly try to get the better."

With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to any one but myself."

"My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good.<eos>: 45.71968254327602
Good gracious!<eos>: 18.59246689601378
_We_ were always good friends;
and now we are better."

"True.<eos>: 40.1525564456221
Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing
at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place.<eos>: 73.84226567248943
But do you think she
would be prevailed on to go back with us?<eos>: 33.089999770025756
I thought I
understood from the Gardiners that you had."

"Yes; he introduced us to his sister."

"And do you like her?"

"Very much."

"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two.<eos>: 44.757566254562676
Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."

She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.

"He meant, I believe," replied Jane, "to go to Epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could
be made out from them.<eos>: 48.98023992746864
But in an instant arose the
dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr.<eos>: 76.28044067301305
Jenkinson's room.<eos>: 11.200549227683341
The advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely.<eos>: 43.83303812887605
The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable
to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration
of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of
splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.

"And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress!<eos>: 44.600406487552
They were in ----
     street.<eos>: 38.185278439271755
Darcy's eyes were fixed
on her.<eos>: 18.06897220055686
It was dated
from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--

     "Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the
     apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments,
     or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to
     you.<eos>: 53.9993136707532
Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home.<eos>: 26.46364069204617
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Lady
Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which
becomes herself and daughter.<eos>: 103.63186849262415
Both changed colour,
one looked white, the other red.<eos>: 40.999244869949614
Bingley were at piquet, and
Mrs.<eos>: 9.103861794830571
In that
county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three
weeks; and to Mrs.<eos>: 25.78736697426755
Darcy had to decide on the propriety of
his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy." "But,"
she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.<eos>: 41.750881126995026
She counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;
hopeless of seeing him before.<eos>: 80.32495406719312
I
am sure my sisters must all envy me.<eos>: 23.62785466154467
"You have reduced
him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty.<eos>: 19.549413244707146
His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living
but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do.<eos>: 49.51114199859508
One must speak a little, you know.<eos>: 36.33897506954431

When a woman has
five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own
beauty."

"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."

"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr.<eos>: 61.007132653583106
But though
every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him
by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend
that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion.<eos>: 46.666874892498804
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of
seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,
economy, and other amiable qualifications."

"Indeed, Mr.<eos>: 35.707347189303455
But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "Mrs.
Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding.<eos>: 42.42601076360953
After a short silence, the lady first spoke.<eos>: 36.9492616340344
But Jane knows, as well as I do, what
Wickham really is.<eos>: 51.22769532699349
The particulars, I reserve till we meet.
     It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them
     both----"

"Then it is, as I always hoped," cried Jane; "they are married!"

     Elizabeth read on; "I have seen them both.<eos>: 51.46491291175811
Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton;

"I had much rather go in the coach."

The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are
on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.

She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr.
Hurst had a house.<eos>: 70.16953356316392

Philips, and
_she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in Meryton.

The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.




CHAPTER XIV.


One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the
lawn.<eos>: 51.31165751759771
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I
think it is well expressed."

To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting.<eos>: 90.93577785230251
"It must be something particular, to take him there at this
time of year."

"Undoubtedly.<eos>: 49.381197704789194
I do not know the
particulars, but I know very well that Mr.<eos>: 16.489717135137877
Thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business."

"And do you impute it to either of those?"

"Yes; to the last.<eos>: 49.5962681186169
She was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
whom they sprung.<eos>: 28.351950915937543
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all
this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half deserved."

"All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet
add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading."

"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_."

"Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all
this?"

"_I_ never saw such a woman.<eos>: 72.39954951733809
Collins, in describing the civility of Mr.<eos>: 12.499799861910715
James's.

As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile
across the park.--Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as Mr.<eos>: 59.21029719726815
But the fact is, that we are very
different sort of men, and that he hates me."

"This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced."

"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_.<eos>: 43.50256827605424
She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance."

The effect was immediate.<eos>: 47.686658212784614
I have not been used to submit to any person's whims.
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."

"_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on _me_."

"I will not be interrupted.<eos>: 23.911451300646515
A scheme of which every part promises delight, can
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation."

When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
always very short.<eos>: 61.908056452500205
The two ladies were delighted to see
their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their
separation.<eos>: 89.48489272657696
Not one party, or scheme, or any thing.<eos>: 32.29235735081017
We must trespass
a little longer on your kindness."

"Removed!" cried Bingley.<eos>: 32.85721460957299
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a
little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a
large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr.<eos>: 47.952559135016905
"But surely," said she, "I may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."

The period of expectation was now doubled.<eos>: 36.454848756790504
We know
how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode.<eos>: 40.156146524404384
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously
so strong an affection.<eos>: 42.727588497543714
Bingley.<eos>: 3.141442750138888
I have nothing to say against
_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
ought to have, I should think you could not do better.<eos>: 38.263618907561685
When my niece Georgiana went to
Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go
with her.--Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr.<eos>: 85.96865292203462
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Collins, she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
was eclipsed by Mr.<eos>: 63.25491826435963
There was one part
especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the
power of reading again.<eos>: 55.66162240724194
Darcy had been at her
sister's wedding.<eos>: 16.739721689307114
Collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at Rosings the next day.




CHAPTER VI.


Mr.<eos>: 53.593469013016275
Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.<eos>: 199.72921830786294
They are young in the ways
of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the
plain."




CHAPTER IV.


With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did January and February pass away.<eos>: 75.10771137620893
I did not think Mrs.
Gardiner was so little to be trusted."

"You must not blame my aunt.<eos>: 29.63430253548419
But it must not, shall not be.<eos>: 33.13416524983676
He was a tall,
heavy looking young man of five and twenty.<eos>: 78.98159264801947
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
The darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.

Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters.<eos>: 66.32354804347355
I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
will favour me with your company."

"Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the
different walks.<eos>: 29.83709223234134
But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early.--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of
youth, as the first.<eos>: 76.97391314648564
Mrs.
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there
was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous
happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus
of her sisters were uttered without being heard.




CHAPTER XIX.


Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort.<eos>: 41.254525932612744
Almost as
soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my
future life.<eos>: 58.31607728974557
Darcy danced
only once with Mrs.<eos>: 33.76453219576313
Bingley,
who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man?<eos>: 93.33723361545185
Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table
could divide them.<eos>: 37.70020749455907
If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?"

"But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so
soon after this event."

"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe.<eos>: 78.32108576975484
Wickham walked into the room,
Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.<eos>: 56.672768475990715
Then, the two third he danced with Miss
King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane
again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger----"

"If he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently,
"he would not have danced half so much!<eos>: 45.2162087090954
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh.

They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what Elizabeth felt.

She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to Elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the
head, and sat down without saying a word.<eos>: 43.87434212784313
You are not going to be _Missish_, I
hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.<eos>: 25.684769572162256
Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was
     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though
     he did not say what.<eos>: 48.87612647860313
He inquired how far
Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
an hesitating manner how long Mr.<eos>: 70.00500999891703
She still cherished a
very tender affection for Bingley.<eos>: 27.865610083926345
But I have always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he
was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the
world."

Elizabeth almost stared at her.--"Can this be Mr.<eos>: 76.90357299666
She could only imagine however
at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about
her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than
in any other person present.<eos>: 88.43999629685688
Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and
she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had
revolted, in his offer to herself.<eos>: 42.12004089666578
have you heard from my uncle?"

"Yes, I have had a letter from him by express."

"Well, and what news does it bring?<eos>: 45.126996846242584
Not that _I_ think
Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend."

"She seems a very pleasant young woman," said Bingley.

"Oh!<eos>: 47.830644552184445
and Mrs.<eos>: 3.8891635654619057
That he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest
opinion.<eos>: 29.07516841922994
Sir William could not have
interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
themselves.--We have tried two or three subjects already without
success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine."

"What think you of books?" said he, smiling.

"Books--Oh!<eos>: 90.56242436719637
The moral will be perfectly fair.<eos>: 36.79078178211951
Is this to be endured!<eos>: 18.47248221636231
My
watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love
with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.<eos>: 36.51904776765174
Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.

Mr.<eos>: 37.86453561220692
Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking
to send her away!<eos>: 30.91182063946812
To all the
objections I have already urged, I have still another to add.<eos>: 71.31226283697309
The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.<eos>: 65.0084765384937
it is very hard to think
that she might have been Mr.<eos>: 15.064446676094251
And I think you will agree with me,
     in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both
     on his account and my niece's.<eos>: 80.82865085918291
In a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he
wants you in the library." She was gone directly.

Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
"Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing?<eos>: 44.982671615810254
And when you have given _your_ ball," she
added, "I shall insist on their giving one also.<eos>: 58.260199061220796
You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.<eos>: 73.18863389765004
That is the place to get
husbands.<eos>: 19.446255769366694
pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen!<eos>: 38.73625964481943
the
happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"

In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose.

"Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door.

"With my mother up stairs.<eos>: 68.47834401950188
Wickham, after a few moments,
touched his hat--a salutation which Mr.<eos>: 17.91975930010611
I am quite well.<eos>: 12.51494359704085
S.
Fairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered
throughout numerous locations.<eos>: 28.846120568669846
This, she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled
that Mr.<eos>: 22.581179752821743
LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.<eos>: 33.16362109973996
Bingley her sister's being in town.

Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.<eos>: 36.72271595963315
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging.<eos>: 44.5146481618358
Darcy,
she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.<eos>: 61.08717568960521
Bennet give up the point.<eos>: 32.96277079008246
One
enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a
suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad.

It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &c.<eos>: 72.64811325184138
She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady
Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if
they could be of use to us."

"She had better have stayed at home," cried Elizabeth; "perhaps she
_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too
little of one's neighbours.<eos>: 54.680815984620565
yes.<eos>: 2.4960232358902763
Elizabeth had frequently
united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine
and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement?<eos>: 86.26264290105775
Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"

"I do not know.--I hope there was.--But to be guarded at such a time, is
very difficult.<eos>: 35.833476680959365
She endeavoured to secure Jane in
her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined
interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks.<eos>: 79.46611304293718
_They_ will
take care not to outrun their income.<eos>: 54.141185536358556
His
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the
mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.

He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went
away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.
Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.

After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.<eos>: 72.78295005384845
Poor
Jane!<eos>: 13.31306669573287
_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest.<eos>: 46.10036483198226
No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room.<eos>: 58.899343770480485
The distance is nothing,
when one has a motive; only three miles.<eos>: 104.16622058460067
At present we
have nothing to guide us.<eos>: 29.328873891627396
Gardiner declared his
willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.

"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so
much?" said her aunt.<eos>: 37.252851420448785
Heaven forbid!<eos>: 20.68153850529623
Wickham is by no means a respectable young man.<eos>: 35.35183247651246
His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
he was the admirer of some one else.<eos>: 32.097656309218486
In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her
own judgment of her situation.<eos>: 35.47514905429632
But at last your uncle was forced
     to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,
     was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,
     which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your
     letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an
     explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give
     the praise where it was due.<eos>: 67.38184112623543
But if you are really innocent and
     ignorant, I must be more explicit.<eos>: 20.62304365568302
If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.<eos>: 56.86236152112553
He must go
     somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have
     nothing to live on.<eos>: 37.83103341664048
The dejection was almost
universal.<eos>: 22.575499520239706
Bennet.


END OF VOL.<eos>: 19.06264661445269
Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
brought the following note for Elizabeth:

     "My dearest Lizzy,

     "I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.<eos>: 64.28982267317997
That he has neither integrity nor honour.<eos>: 32.10065095380265
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of
     the kingdom.<eos>: 25.93653800050097
Darcy has no defect.<eos>: 32.59344614219279
"In essentials, I believe, he is very much
what he ever was."

While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.<eos>: 61.23758153123334
When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.<eos>: 19.347537220627324
I grieve to
     find, however, that Colonel F.<eos>: 21.48668106657381
Darcy's
pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this
was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend Mr.<eos>: 54.21566329192878
Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of
his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.




CHAPTER XVI.


Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
Elizabeth half expected Mr.<eos>: 63.96987019156593
Oh,
Lord!<eos>: 11.029733937971429
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Those to her mother, contained little else, than that
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as Mrs.<eos>: 57.8434571929156
But I
cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London.<eos>: 34.52278031600297
Change of scene might be of
service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as
anything."

Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister's ready acquiescence.

"I hope," added Mrs.<eos>: 57.12562937990415
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while.<eos>: 52.58833575957195
I am so happy.
In a short time, I shall have a daughter married.<eos>: 25.231479603200025
Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own
     disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of
     such an enormity, at so early an age.<eos>: 37.160684375434386
It is unaccountable!<eos>: 15.442865866731603
Every thing was too recent for
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any
thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.

When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
and made the important communication.<eos>: 51.333343017625914
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
who attended to you?<eos>: 31.700582869004048
I shall like it of all
things.<eos>: 27.811642052888274
Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good
humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that
could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight
as the rattle of the chaise.<eos>: 61.41547063018778
my sweetest Lizzy!<eos>: 15.25030720623966
It had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and
quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a
mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he
could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by
business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.<eos>: 57.719258500268126
Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every
body.<eos>: 32.206701598200425
And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"

"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.<eos>: 58.77540348104179
If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
dark.<eos>: 41.81241840483771
He seldom appeared really
animated.<eos>: 37.319275754942915
But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother's.<eos>: 40.38051729142124
Collins you
have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
as well to be silent.<eos>: 53.98846626240585
Why did the Forsters ever let her go out
of their sight?<eos>: 79.03621403974643
"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone,
"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves."

Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.

"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs.<eos>: 41.99442949290484
Yet he knew to the contrary himself.<eos>: 43.46349410438196
So much the better.<eos>: 33.78797213288776
The
adieu is charity itself.<eos>: 66.65175775229311
Wont it, Kitty?"

Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.<eos>: 39.75950315685742
If I have wounded your sister's
     feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which
     governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have
     not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more
     weighty accusation, of having injured Mr.<eos>: 50.25898505352825
Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling
solemnity replied,

"It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your
time not disagreeably.<eos>: 45.26504222831769
You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and

Without a governess you must
have been neglected."

"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn, never wanted the means.<eos>: 67.44871643650477
These recollections will not do at
all.<eos>: 36.12492791167483
But
my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr.<eos>: 82.61617721497399
I send no compliments to your
mother.<eos>: 25.3633546322502
She had known, it seems,
of their being in love with each other, many weeks."

"But not before they went to Brighton?"

"No, I believe not."

"And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself?<eos>: 45.76819788692862
Darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.<eos>: 36.60244876265861
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who
was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
delighted with her.<eos>: 45.55314476212006
Stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing, after all."

"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."

Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.

"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs.
Gardiner, "but perhaps to the Lakes."

No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.<eos>: 68.3947033156858
He now wished it more than ever.<eos>: 35.43153948972781
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general
Charlotte wisely did not hear.<eos>: 47.69535655802358
The
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"

She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister's spirits.<eos>: 72.95446742476119
Bennet sat quite still, and
unable to utter a syllable.<eos>: 39.583865856948314
Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was
pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr.<eos>: 31.499894059336548
Philips, as well as her sister, stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.
Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all
likely to make her more elegant.<eos>: 54.08557088220403
I expected
you to stay two months.<eos>: 46.566576582719925
This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
late to be saving.<eos>: 50.48271750628978
For
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
contrary, he was all attention to every body.<eos>: 32.198815177214776
But I am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.<eos>: 47.122750856358486
At such a time, much might
have been said, and silence was very awkward.<eos>: 47.78379076251658
A low phaeton, with a nice little
     pair of ponies, would be the very thing.<eos>: 32.68026676744422
It adds even another motive.<eos>: 45.02774726320544
My
father, however, is partial to Mr.<eos>: 15.655766570816658
It was reasonable that he should feel
he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising
it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,
she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might
assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be
materially concerned.<eos>: 56.88416854900061
These
were the contents:

     "MY DEAR HARRIET,

     "You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
     missed.<eos>: 44.237274443638185
I want to be told whether I
ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand
Wickham's character."

Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, "Surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.<eos>: 55.298655562066884
The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced of what Mr.<eos>: 20.353153754626053
Adieu.<eos>: 2.287366512317687
Collins, however, was not
discouraged from speaking again, and Mr.<eos>: 16.913714627794384
Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you."

Mrs.<eos>: 18.509895952257427
They are descended on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient, though untitled families.<eos>: 38.00775754596919
Two obstacles of the
five being thus removed, Mrs.<eos>: 49.984140848352105
it is just as he chooses.<eos>: 17.581858473249714
I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve."

Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sister's warm affection.

"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair.<eos>: 48.31208014424943
Surprise was the least
of her feelings on this developement.<eos>: 23.288036676406932
Wickham were, and that
     he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia
     once.<eos>: 79.58152823565108
Besides, there was truth in his
looks."

"It is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--One does not know what to
think."

"I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think."

But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.
Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the
affair became public.

The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom
they had been speaking; Mr.<eos>: 72.99075926074426
Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.
Elizabeth now began to revive.<eos>: 24.47856424263484
You must send John with
the young ladies, Mrs.<eos>: 20.161533976744444
The old lady is Mrs.<eos>: 54.97293528272825
But, perhaps his sister does as well
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her."

"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must
divide with me.<eos>: 36.28131233152951
She was disappointed,
and angry with herself for being so.

"Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said she.<eos>: 40.178547390279384
I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it in the papers.<eos>: 18.651765595969295
Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.

But she had no reason to fear Mr.<eos>: 37.09970731178113
He did every
thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of September, than any body else in the country.

One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,

"Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe.<eos>: 39.03414182793592
I
must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself, or a better natural taste.<eos>: 83.19475792962432
Its windows
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.

In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there
with Mrs.<eos>: 39.92352233078125
We were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary.<eos>: 42.046919949628986
You must not suspect me.<eos>: 11.863791797989903
After waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no
longer.<eos>: 55.19859480168827
She saw with the creative eye of
fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers.<eos>: 42.14527820245254
He addressed
himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr.<eos>: 25.735174994324208
She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however
impenetrably grave.<eos>: 45.74550697642627
Elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.

At length the Parsonage was discernible.<eos>: 28.54949802714
Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards
herself.<eos>: 30.961901261692265
It is such a spur to one's genius, such an
opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind.<eos>: 44.08875484193728
The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most
friendly and obliging.<eos>: 35.72139673874643
But who was your mother?<eos>: 33.919699249929664
