Avg perplexity: 10.085294639541948

I told you so from the first, you may remember."  "I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly."  "You did!: 12.520703601214402
The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister.: 8.769524136079346
The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances.: 10.634516347512905
Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity, are not worth a regret.: 10.882658076971607
Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep.: 11.756082466512177
Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.: 11.774589063945259
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on.: 11.51911685672516
I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them."  "I am not now to learn," replied Mr.: 8.7135920824333
"Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time.: 10.548423247264472
From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him.: 11.923277916862562
His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal.: 11.749775826611524
They have at least that advantage."  "The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for such a study.: 10.674102243628932
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.: 10.10833587330936
When Mr.: 1.069996212637111
Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me?: 11.11850957106666
Mrs.: 1.2472880342983486
To be sure London was rather thin, but however the little Theatre was open.: 15.442378341329189
Bingley!: 10.68816729964052
Her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her.: 10.037120043775364
and Mrs.: 1.0600473090678837
And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable amount.: 10.021449552209129
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves.: 10.162954813041917
Mamma would like to go too of all things!: 12.836245601627423
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield.: 12.391610263141192
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.: 10.354149042384313
Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.: 10.231750409669958
If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all."         *       *       *       *       *  The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs.: 11.144719735564957
Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family.: 9.431188603388769
Mrs.: 1.2472880342983486
Bennet, "that is very unlucky."  "Can I have the carriage?" said Jane.: 14.282588812334813
They were, therefore, to go.--Elizabeth was pleased, though, when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.: 11.470235424139085
They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family.: 8.953887945353785
Lydia left a few lines for his wife,      informing her of their intention.: 13.755390130375256
They were ignorant, idle, and vain.: 4.658639309023149
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.: 7.5563124777973325
His temptation is not adequate to the risk."  "Do you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.: 10.77046143835252
I hope he will overlook it.: 11.116509701550706
It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of it.: 9.240901432962513
I will try again.: 12.019773880245175
_He_ shall be mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish."  "No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose.: 11.36765568899267
On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks.: 11.706333208287138
Reynolds replied, that he was, adding, "but we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends." How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!: 10.511136124983308
The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification.: 9.571757121388591
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule."  "Such as vanity and pride."  "Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.: 9.707531321443735
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving home.: 8.585334621072112
Is not he a charming man?: 15.320431506525374
Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one.: 11.79031176501157
Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance."  "I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match," cried Elizabeth.: 10.538721138936427
Hear me in silence.: 10.213781550929086
"A place too, with which so many of your acquaintance are connected.: 12.601395169719522
Wickham was to      the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it      to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his      profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a      valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became      vacant.: 11.652969508075289
He is so excessively handsome!: 14.59141263150603
This will never do."  "You need not distress yourself.: 11.260870666159944
His character is thereby complete."  "I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.: 9.857077719469464
Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.: 10.222861580052422
"For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her.: 13.93226064613929
With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr.: 10.883945338676025
Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr.: 10.209222136988204
She liked him too little to care for his approbation.: 11.625543991031355
"He must be an oddity, I think," said she.: 13.232757111770155
Mr.: 1.2049424672861444
I wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you!: 9.159640345712186
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.: 10.779103055878426
Egerton, Military Library, Whitehall.: 15.652642238539439
Elizabeth was delighted.: 3.003569755058573
Where shall you change horses?--Oh!: 7.049609564996097
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.: 10.592882744231812
Bennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.: 10.099016245035846
And when you have given _your_ ball," she added, "I shall insist on their giving one also.: 8.14399437890102
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy, than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her.: 11.833012986244599
In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness.: 10.550336480174495
"It must not be thought of.: 14.942680455292306
"I hope, my dear," said Mr.: 5.3563845702230415
If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough.: 14.014155704964796
yes.: 9.712158988419903
"But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike is founded.: 9.201742610469037
"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with.: 11.234878163750677
Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets; and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_ been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.: 11.259631754188252
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess.: 12.746756453582794
It was all pride and insolence.: 12.826478405190016
Is _her_ husband, is the son of his late father's steward, to be his brother?: 9.781910947709825
However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr.: 12.245325447243893
My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.: 9.280811686883517
Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.: 12.709458640845263
Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr.: 11.641328946640503
"MY DEAR NIECE,       "I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole      morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will      not comprise what I have to tell you.: 12.745464980677518
And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.: 12.239896378659184
Bingley.: 8.006622580051337
Philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before.: 9.118125834188419
But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them.: 10.3756259690678
Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.: 10.92282752179601
Collins's character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on entering the marriage state."  Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.: 9.572740948950386
Darcy.: 9.738681305547711
"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"  "To-morrow fortnight."  "Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs.: 9.356354881167615
Surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement.: 15.916949735731128
Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.: 9.885639006069907
"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness.: 9.413616810540908
Nothing was      to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do      not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your      uncle would most readily have settled the whole.: 11.55616394044791
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.: 11.556562872606873
Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.: 12.052921509428304
Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers, have been in her head.: 9.868416507066609
and Mrs.: 1.0600473090678837
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.: 5.056645072415278
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.: 10.180437676147264
On the following Monday, Mrs.: 6.797856530722314
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing      but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed      him to act as he has done.: 11.57366323503588
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?: 11.694365637077494
Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself.: 14.293990771743811
She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice.: 11.010673036532257
On being made acquainted with the present Mr.: 7.1436284494020414
A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it.: 10.619531933774255
I must conclude, for I cannot be      long from my poor mother.: 13.58974647038985
Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.: 12.510411065417996
Mrs.: 1.2472880342983486
All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.: 10.478061917523458
Collins.: 12.101069350814699
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.: 11.907157015134828
"There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be?"  "Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know."  "La!" replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with him before.: 11.441803849760207
Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, "if that disagreeable Mr.: 11.168680880833362
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.: 13.837867004790239
And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.: 13.737851938386747
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.: 9.377616128870251
Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr.: 10.695567189947532
She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening.: 10.164569352772256
Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but      of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one      witness of undoubted veracity.: 14.41407121843943
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us.: 10.25283763815202
That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice!: 10.203559830049215
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement.: 9.370160929432016
Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance.: 12.067828339828845
and so extremely accomplished for her age!: 9.789892735982937
The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs.: 9.556679896308987
Wickham ought not to be a      clergyman.: 8.424356195337914
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.: 8.780634406792304
Wickham with money."  "Well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle?: 9.415253442635779
But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew.: 11.138630572293485
From that moment I      observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then      perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had      ever witnessed in him.: 11.472119032954726
But we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger impulses even than pride."  "Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"  "Yes.: 11.806217398275498
I will put on my things in a moment.: 8.733447984633413
Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me.: 11.533622612952364
"My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street."  She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.: 9.245637310462428
1.E.5.: 4.393837139746475
Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.: 10.76346274326338
Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.: 12.212254621314038
Darcy would bring his sister to visit her, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.: 12.623619400439766
Bingley.--It was an animating subject, and Mrs.: 7.6149370500190505
CHAPTER XV.: 1.3179356363614787
Arguments are too much like disputes.: 13.888597950146623
Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better.: 9.44974024607303
Mr.: 1.2049424672861444
Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking to send her away!: 8.513160173540347
Good girl!: 13.104685625923096
But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant.: 11.756090728594673
The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.: 10.91083190491586
Of his former way of life, nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself.: 12.873898822925755
Darcy was here when you sent for us;--was it so?"  "Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.: 9.782403209585928
"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin.: 11.427409696650479
CHAPTER VIII.: 1.3179356363614787
Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:  "You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly.: 10.758008719319047
Collins."  "From Mr.: 10.02172817377866
"I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel Millar's regiment went away.: 7.8553722759624796
With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs.: 9.919851401144824
Mrs.: 1.2472880342983486
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way."  "I can easily believe it.: 10.182186046621647
Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said,  "But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir?--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of offending your patroness."  "My dear sir," replied Mr.: 9.871029460828236
What are men to rocks and mountains?: 11.742571056300207
Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.: 11.823051448932153
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them.: 9.7571019516242
Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come."  Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.: 10.76815677373675
But it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."  "I see no occasion for that.: 11.714870828959315
My dear Mr.: 1.0147943849618424
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education."  Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case.: 11.254364959720268
I am the happiest creature in      the world.: 4.5458047938992046
Who would have thought it!: 9.002242999550543
I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.: 10.996310086244618
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.: 10.8371358902908
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency.: 12.723338787262719
how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.: 14.403940168874145
I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers.: 9.923213438456242
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her, must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.: 10.634718598474956
If there were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.: 11.497033125141064
Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure."  She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library,  "Oh!: 11.438592402135882
Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr.: 10.260148665156079
She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times.: 10.763471096872447
They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas.: 10.577193404915446
1813.: 6.423912051115137
But you know married women have never much time for writing.: 10.517034044856777
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her."  Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them.: 11.324746296818015
To persuade him against      returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,      was scarcely the work of a moment.--I cannot blame myself for      having done thus much.: 10.790715304408874
Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.: 10.401107454121094
What a fine thing for our girls!"  "How so?: 11.803737832688165
Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.: 11.371591459485384
The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants.: 11.167556632273723
The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging.: 11.090947537876684
Gardiner could do.: 4.788632233466389
It was evident thahopet she was much better acquainted with Mr.: 9.263261955770165
Bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.: 9.01985109942474
No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called.: 13.697865899261135
Their father then went to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.: 9.631852035071278
He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.: 8.86266939228296
Bennet instantly answered,  "Oh dear!--Yes--certainly.--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection.--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs." And gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out,  "Dear Ma'am, do not go.--I beg you will not go.--Mr.: 11.0505924886734
The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt.: 11.765145182304527
Their reception from Mr.: 2.8348638239344224
She could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.: 10.241679191320975
Mrs.: 1.2472880342983486
Wickham is safe."  "And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune."  "She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."  "But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane.: 9.309457146255662
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them.: 12.217689404522051
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions.: 11.19397021951339
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit.: 10.283551101195586
"Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.: 12.225516804370892
Her reflections were in general satisfactory.: 11.383705834810934
I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it."  "I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.: 10.890994634040435
It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."  "Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."  "I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a studier of character.: 10.16110052626471
They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.: 10.512462781679039
With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr.: 11.70440422625981
or had you intended any more serious consequence?"  "My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me.: 13.061882497009654
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed.: 12.294932403126012
Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she knew not how to believe that Mr.: 8.614223443446344
Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body.: 9.580083183266256
And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty.: 8.546567518693848
Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.: 10.167706075780984
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.: 11.44798810065833
The express was sent off directly.: 4.094168870939481
Bennet.: 11.490938835167562
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr.: 7.444474753211944
My aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing."  "Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use.: 12.005398850859246
But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "Mrs.: 11.423463565209408
Mr.: 1.2049424672861444
"I see your design, Bingley," said his friend.--"You dislike an argument, and want to silence this."  "Perhaps I do.: 12.297513027474407
Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.: 11.315449194586309
I hate such false friends.: 7.200425373992123
She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out.: 9.501425587979767
She could think only of her letter.: 10.811143798631894
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.: 8.27536356716504
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr.: 8.789027595009344
Every thing that is charming!: 21.228600659112573
So imprudent a      match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that      his character has been misunderstood.: 9.441903358142284
I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.: 9.20331414399335
Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr.: 10.72737014875098
You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."  "I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression.: 12.066431264215549
He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her.: 11.694366641802368
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer.: 10.857965839236789
How can they suit each other?--Do you know Mr.: 8.922015041848233
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts."  Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.: 13.103649779984622
Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.: 7.810190277943408
They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better.: 12.708739088414658
Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--It is impossible.: 10.769039379276876
Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?: 9.813717091998273
See paragraph 1.C below.: 7.993102057610553
Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.: 10.85580544472113
He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex.: 14.996892357863661
The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.: 13.057420846496731
"Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know.: 11.772194644948534
There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible, that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected.: 9.897693674071014
To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit.: 7.274894344874765
She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done.: 10.48334615670383
"Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, "and what do you think of my husband?: 8.953218899944176
Darcy's proposals.: 35.35277263999
For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more      particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our      near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of      the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted      with every particular of these transactions.: 9.54684662734592
If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.: 10.200152929661483
But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is.: 8.27923952911338
Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.: 13.116421647333661
Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,  "My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.: 10.112165009903341
This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.: 9.911925801223845
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.: 12.313547948765596
But enough of this.: 13.501599610965213
Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight."  "Are they indeed?" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.: 13.099630268217705
She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.: 11.644170782182574
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man--he is a great friend of Darcy's."  "Oh!: 8.88025758541188
The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs.: 8.174319116285082
"I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs.: 10.270786110155933
He does not want abilities.: 16.898517311638305
Poor little Lizzy!: 15.833181375654837
At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.: 9.985141894328475
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.: 13.642495963945294
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty.: 12.239446046589965
She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham.: 10.524473353963048
They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve.: 15.641034444978267
I dare say Mr.: 4.702759629259923
Mrs.: 1.2472880342983486
Her affections had been continually fluctuating, but never without an object.: 12.071974122837752
Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.: 12.433033139295496
Everything wore a happier aspect.: 15.31459632855964
Mr.: 1.2049424672861444
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.: 11.073997224705163
Let me hear what it is."  "We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.: 8.492825351014558
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err.: 9.860503128173535
Gardiner.: 11.231972464998424
But against this, there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.: 11.36557280122611
Wickham in and near Brighton, with      assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself.: 11.842192607998932
The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.: 10.933216058932075
If an individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg are removed.: 7.999474544428898
Of Mr.: 1.1115206830390987
"There is also one other person in the party," he continued after a pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?"  The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.: 11.143822587734762
Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr.: 12.094947490943776
Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there      proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.: 7.492878392347325
"I should like to know how he behaves among strangers."  "You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.: 11.100609792708465
Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr.: 7.114351404073949
*       *       *       *       *  Mr.: 4.128100051737807
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what Jane felt for Bingley.: 12.598430468337241
Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked.: 11.178619025435532
"Good Heaven!: 1.4876052094392627
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw.: 15.331100443298116
Robinson."  "Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr.: 8.441954259422973
I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older."  In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned.: 11.13793215385353
"You write uncommonly fast."  "You are mistaken.: 7.290720998340727
Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.: 10.286707471168071
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr.: 9.029536973699308
James's, Sir William was so completely awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look.: 10.424056685420704
Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence?: 7.273342634055317
He spoke of it as a certain event,      of which the time alone could be undecided.: 13.721207764428188
Every body said how well she looked; and Mr.: 9.098108098861427
After lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that Mr.: 10.696884649117575
Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill.: 7.7565131297727055
Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.: 11.732405269052263
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility.: 9.7297391256603
"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"  He made no answer.: 8.69376285207555
"My dear Friend,       "If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and      me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our      lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never      end without a quarrel.: 10.190084160978932
The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.: 14.054841548144175
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.: 11.405499107171266
Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.: 11.240243662690839
Ten thousand a year, and very likely more!: 4.576961678783841
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr.: 11.807336299966266
She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr.: 9.740584613344506
Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.: 13.31489801391358
Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr.: 11.470451858686001
Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again.: 9.177437157092458
Pray, how _violent was_ Mr.: 8.188791050559882
"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr.: 9.727937218746703
"I cannot see why Mrs.: 10.300156475943822
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together.: 7.580182964991463
Mr.: 1.2049424672861444
Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose."  "Good God!: 12.277820723219005
I should infinitely prefer a book."  But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.: 8.178059603985298
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!"  "Oh!: 9.30158616189297
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?: 12.758192494218624
Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation, &c.: 9.567665235130361
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening.: 10.886634713649899
Darcy said very little, and Mr.: 8.312666821937295
She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before.: 12.714585558330594
During dinner, Mr.: 4.294037542340989
Mrs.: 1.2472880342983486
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other.: 8.431131496703081
How is such a man to be worked on?: 8.500089212398992
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.: 11.494702267136239
However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were."  "And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently.: 13.27076680889896
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs.: 10.641808307568667
The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do."  They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr.: 9.942347482794913
"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to his friend within a few days," she added, "I shall know how to understand it.: 9.990681610737338
Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."  She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.: 10.84302757985651
When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give.: 10.929176155776421
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family.: 9.902132333544056
But still he would be her husband.--Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want.: 12.286494527709259
She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper.: 11.820944799473384
I shall go distracted."  This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away.: 10.773587357476766
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.: 11.642083073038169
I felt a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right.: 11.27952451557439
There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.: 13.171041744716089
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.: 9.046360816284906
She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself.: 10.897829262741071
He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have attained it.: 11.506217827702026
Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred.: 10.518136713459036
She could only imagine however at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present.: 10.86387062062754
Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.: 9.710940645199017
Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent.: 11.153600807033287
Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty.: 11.117832514777593
His behaviour to us has,      in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.: 12.551900798102814
Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.: 10.65527062252625
Did you see him while you were at Lambton?: 14.183713903661017
Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr.: 6.977437262210681
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did."  The idea of Mr.: 8.867265035995493
*       *       *       *       *  "Good gracious!" cried Mrs.: 5.425955360979237
Mrs.: 1.2472880342983486
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.: 9.865734369662249
Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.--But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.: 11.38048265007608
But why Mr.: 1.2049424672861444
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.: 10.767014849478828
If you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.: 6.190290474598733
Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body, and had so many favourites.: 11.987367353014617
But does not Jane correspond with the sister?: 16.91330153941576
W.: 1.5537618232761052
Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation.: 10.8366718169226
- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free      distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.: 4.942784875333095
He looked serious as usual; and she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley.: 8.377968602931738
Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.: 14.401070332134667
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.: 12.195414953923123
I do not trust my own partiality.: 15.925434141888749
Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.: 10.554709277195762
Could he expect that her friends would not step forward?: 13.314026064739807
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs.: 7.942153609318976
While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for ever.: 12.63940559799224
That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling.: 11.628083046262152
In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger.: 11.484823105550745
I am perfectly satisfied.: 7.48515515456572
And this consideration leads me moreover to      reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last      November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in      all your sorrow and disgrace.: 10.353050634801974
No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it.: 11.188260143126243
Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.: 11.834225469794928
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs.: 10.590434420333816
My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal."  "You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, "that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us."  Mrs.: 9.046881691637505
You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say.: 6.733796311442943
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday."  "Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."  This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley.: 10.614291448818907
You have a sweet room here, Mr.: 8.926615720760553
Why Jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing!: 13.291150907709865
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.: 15.728946129835505
With _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others!: 9.59433478923501
I depend on you for that." To these high flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr.: 10.248774566297627
or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?"  "You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said Darcy in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.: 10.66432377898473
See paragraph 1.E below.: 10.039549280769197
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent.: 10.360307452864129
And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much.: 9.311746723807456
Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.: 9.246233632103866
"Oh!: 1.8506496099686296
Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.: 11.87367379785868
Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr.: 11.365558499101068
CHAPTER IX.: 1.3179356363614787
CHAPTER I.: 10.677248482135436
We _will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.: 8.824629355901484
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr.: 10.72728216411059
Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?: 11.910110596047614
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you.: 7.7664934323068575
It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning.: 9.642079437811777
Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come, when if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.: 10.207997454892121
At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable.: 9.322553319059269
"That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance.: 10.045440706201997
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."  Elizabeth could not but look surprised.: 10.588130768360614
Wickham and our poor Lydia      would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for      there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.: 9.296300034474719
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton.: 11.726663465583725
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her replies.: 11.706384482281392
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.: 11.0204917934697
Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.: 11.666954725095708
in every view it is unaccountable!"  "My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.: 7.233649840043915
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations.: 11.204811747563108
who instantly taking the alarm, set off      from B.: 7.735914489984036
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it."  "What should not you mind?"  "I should not mind any thing at all."  "Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility."  "I never can be thankful, Mr.: 10.897282566462389
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before.: 8.939602231286154
He merely added, that he should not write again, till he had something of importance to mention."  "And my mother--How is she?: 11.40621809614618
His attachment to Rosings, certainly increases."  Mr.: 9.636578884730099
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!"  "She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.: 11.45311685989435
Collins joining in, observed,  "Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her.: 9.553335433488641
and Mrs.: 1.0600473090678837
The path just admitted three.: 7.542335335003542
While she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.: 7.647124508950977
In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgment of her situation.: 13.799505487284723
Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss Bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"  "I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr.: 9.670265810783924
There was no want of discourse.: 7.228781772218215
Mr.: 1.2049424672861444
And his behaviour, so strikingly altered,--what could it mean?: 12.34205916748121
Jenkinson were sitting.--Her Ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs.: 8.47233081158843
Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars.: 11.393413461617387
Gardiner abused her stupidity.: 11.06438331892323
I am very, very sorry.: 12.8348923571897
"Good Heaven!: 1.4876052094392627
She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge.: 13.712996150149637
The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed, copied or distributed:  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.: 8.81601079067085
Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together.: 9.438065024736707
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved, and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.: 10.962824787499493
Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time.: 11.467428133122956
Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?"  "With great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic."  "You are severe on us."  "It will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said Miss Lucas.: 10.372018489080165
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr.: 9.821966481301615
Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.: 11.515631799075916
All connection between us seemed now dissolved.: 7.533336145217164
"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"  "I will make no promise of the kind."  "Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.: 11.552750773680827
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of preference which was often given me."  "I had not thought Mr.: 9.23475027808441
In Three Volumes.: 12.847824102230273
Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.: 14.289004913782367
Mr.: 1.2049424672861444
Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.: 9.970344290220543
Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself.: 10.625443216083541
U.S.: 1.2132222311483098
Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.: 12.246078961454733
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world.: 10.09108931463063
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.: 13.046697755109943
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.: 11.509675278860122
I am perfectly serious in my refusal.--You could not make _me_ happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so.--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation."  "Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr.: 11.189144165264732
Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service.: 8.587518640703852
Gardiner was so little to be trusted."  "You must not blame my aunt.: 11.8164549601117
It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.: 8.419869836409916
I was told, that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that _you_, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr.: 10.380537168638641
Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home.: 10.455804625812746
Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth.: 9.266677947583513
I want to talk very seriously.: 15.906516021536213
Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs.: 10.53039739310457
Lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off.: 11.938854117470287
Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all,      before she leaves the South.: 11.393569535491574
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.: 11.149290153940056
You must not suspect me.: 15.229323519499562
More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please than when they last met, were plainly expressed.: 12.175080917164923
Perhaps there was some truth in      _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_      reserve, can be answerable for the event.: 12.916772410062032
I _must_ have employment and society.: 8.722538348337341
She felt anew the justice of Mr.: 5.981655432339709
What will Wickham say?: 9.125566875424637
Collins; "but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.: 13.036322997357919
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.: 6.653676675115878
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"  "You can _now_ have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered.: 10.815912722327061
I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real      defect of his character after all.: 11.619421825605793
CHAPTER V.: 1.3179356363614787
But she is nothing to me now.: 17.012662682088433
I rather wished, than      believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to      accede to his proposal.: 9.772099802238934
CHAPTER VIII.: 1.3179356363614787
Mrs.: 1.2472880342983486
Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.: 10.129191510579732
She was at least free from the offence of Mr.: 8.519448670630242
Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.: 12.931660581799692
The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.: 11.059011964265592
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope, though you have but a short lease."  "Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes.: 13.641708736047779
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.: 10.690235531626676
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due."  "My object _then_," replied Darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to.: 11.852616890870468
This letter is from Mr.: 6.59841198226578
Girls, can I do any thing for you in Meryton?: 15.469358344074431
Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.: 13.025849562160769
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were      all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was      gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,      with Wickham!--Imagine our surprise.: 10.74293001742595
It will not do.: 14.270484432790767
But Mrs.: 1.3620210389955378
Collins!: 13.111034184659657
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper.: 13.798825175155688
In short, I will do my best."  "Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very often.: 14.254614477059887
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.: 14.549909494375099
He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.: 11.166980841244994
She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible.: 10.360224724980007
I promised them so faithfully!: 12.27525645407327
Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.: 9.628990988183766
From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr.: 9.220284898063134
He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.: 12.8322318022977
She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs.: 10.643539952962845
It was hardly enough; but it pleased her.: 10.255650241176122
All was joy and kindness.: 11.542891644921099
Mr.: 1.2049424672861444
By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property (trademark/copyright) agreement.: 7.933669148690321
"But how did he account for it?"  "It must have been his sister's doing.: 11.419786276729752
Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone.: 10.75213880102958
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr.: 8.731407146751929
But _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a      loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible      flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me      actually married, you cannot greatly err.: 10.129035333703529
I don't know.: 8.009521909351873
She read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes.: 9.986972154373225
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.: 11.536946515607074
Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.: 11.934506387089847
Though Mr.: 1.2049424672861444
Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"  "No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too little said on the subject."  "La!: 10.160328223631904
Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?"  "Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."  "But I was embarrassed."  "And so was I."  "You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."  "A man who had felt less, might."  "How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it!: 12.29462645154785
Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr.: 11.717663565606422
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room.: 9.204629930251993
Darcy.: 9.738681305547711
Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr.: 9.344278101659457
"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"  "Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months."  "Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate."  "If your master would marry, you might see more of him."  "Yes, Sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be.: 10.574479575816813
We passed each other several times.: 8.15609707163437
And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it.: 9.903269864835115
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.: 10.902739613132331
CHAPTER VIII.: 1.3179356363614787
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it.: 10.698343404851029
There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard.: 8.569804134056069
Perhaps I am not doing her justice.: 13.600106551059712
He had found the law a most unprofitable study,      and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would      present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there      could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other      person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered      father's intentions.: 13.1195123920062
My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done!: 12.355655204235415
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."  "I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."  "But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity."  "I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied.: 11.375074300361721
Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days.: 11.848032203479946
There was no arguing upon such a project.: 16.057054870198623
If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy!: 12.216348809514203
I thank you for explaining it so fully.: 12.279976942829716
Bennet came from it.: 10.567746972765798
Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.: 10.701171736639655
Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.: 10.761230837306833
She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs.: 8.49813886255496
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede.: 12.87948204391899
Haggerston has our directions, and      all will be completed in a week.: 14.157821503597425
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.: 10.51447488131413
This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place.: 12.044746224157034
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the      intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea      of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as      a father, acknowledged the whole to me.: 10.222826367398747
Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand; but in vain.: 9.59454039738157
I must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.: 12.082698083169692
She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr.: 10.76229996780889
Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.: 11.652114383467643
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together.: 10.614477106769732
This is my advice.: 9.187547058374024
I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you."  Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention!: 11.4749104792599
She shared in their attendance on Mrs.: 8.82970492038326
You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.: 14.109289695920525
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?"  "Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear."       _Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,       15th October._       DEAR SIR,       The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured      father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the      misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the      breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing      lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good      terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at      variance.--"There, Mrs.: 11.711248806723239
If he fears me, why come hither?: 10.179950942571214
She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family.: 11.470022895067306
Mrs.: 1.2472880342983486
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.: 11.179294206864762
Oh, no."  "But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham."  "No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."  "But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very next day."  She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham.: 10.784084448461309
Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others.: 9.71522767735302
The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.: 11.228176219856637
But amidst      your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your      displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you      consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to      avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally      bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to      the sense and disposition of both.--I will only say farther, that      from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was      confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me      before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy      connection.--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,      as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon      returning.--The part which I acted, is now to be explained.--His      sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our      coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible      that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly      resolved on joining him directly in London.--We accordingly      went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to      my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--I described, and      enforced them earnestly.--But, however this remonstrance might have      staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it      would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been      seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your      sister's indifference.: 11.222409736429192
For your sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family.--Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?"  "A little."  "Oh!: 8.779509079731588
And if you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."  "You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan."  Lady Catherine seemed resigned.: 11.09928870955091
I cannot but wonder,      however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at      all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.: 12.075757464712478
My father was not      only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always      engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the      church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.: 10.150844090943497
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode.: 11.453854899314766
Elizabeth was now to see Mr.: 9.558011056412631
Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.: 11.613320752030113
She dreaded seeing Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.: 9.637570832394976
There was no help for it however.: 16.628704894707873
I _will_ leave him to himself."  In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it.: 10.243020591230659
Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on:--"I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.: 11.301888275328352
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style?: 9.932646582179721
But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.: 9.688540401095455
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--How humiliating is this discovery!--Yet, how just a humiliation!--Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind.: 12.391648047915877
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr.: 9.118078599353034
This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married.: 10.983937930829779
I will not tell you what it is.: 15.731527730878279
Darcy?"  "They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine."  "It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with ease, cannot write ill."  "That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease.: 11.468347502921384
This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled." And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr.: 8.379355525261492
Imprudent as a marriage between Mr.: 6.891066541489431
He has given in all his debts; I hope      at least he has not deceived us.: 10.926482358718083
Mrs.: 1.2472880342983486
You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr.: 9.709714130112733
Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself.: 10.2168370700246
Mr.: 1.2049424672861444
Wickham's being among them.: 17.2527567641581
Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr.: 9.242472626453672
she was dying to know what could be his meaning"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?: 11.396455210019509
James's.: 29.55188978633795
No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_.: 8.3891657717982
I have not _that_ pain.: 12.474111523671791
One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn.: 9.069914325369748
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.: 9.156220046024842
Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.: 11.274048926932256
single, my dear, to be sure!: 8.031637631605395
My dear Charles, what do you mean?"  "Yes, all of them, I think.: 7.640228600947627
Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, Sir.--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."  The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.: 11.051259937018548
His pride never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing something for fortune and figure."  The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and Mr.: 10.510401721185625
She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means.: 12.297277798816584
Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?: 13.328359743378535
"How good it was in you, my dear Mr.: 8.525366477860903
When is your turn to come?: 12.396068267401002
She had a sister married to a Mr.: 10.5186000614148
They were natural and just.: 12.72833157327245
and so did Mrs.: 3.2195162693361787
Then pray speak aloud.: 6.142092103433782
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.: 13.186229491883363
Indeed, Mr.: 1.0451945556972704
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience.: 13.254160202171855
But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me."  "This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced."  "Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_.: 9.50908575606234
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.: 13.469117677701414
On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book.: 11.259136710399954
Bennet were dead.: 3.7230180879135117
The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now."  "Indeed!"  "Yes--the late Mr.: 10.087017999116489
Gardiner.: 11.231972464998424
Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table could divide them.: 12.90889380657019
But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.: 10.174881323414134
Bingley.--But--good lord!: 6.640441799932252
"As soon as ever Mr.: 6.074590569702546
Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_."  Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.: 12.403342657365643
Collins was eloquent in her praise.: 11.088163880920694
The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tête-à-tête with Mrs.: 5.361701617022691
Darcy might have done as well."  "Mr.: 9.898927647764085
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness."  And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.: 11.703300419821984
Poor Jane!: 1.7915301408078124
It will save me a world of trouble and economy.: 12.29070178416578
Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner."  She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,  "You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it."  Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.: 10.360373651485764
Collins.: 12.101069350814699
Our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character.: 10.218108317304054
Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.: 14.352762047860713
What could be more natural than his asking you again?: 13.9305593536862
1.C.: 6.609891538394875
Darcy?"  "As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth warmly,--"I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable."  "I have no right to give _my_ opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being agreeable or otherwise.: 11.616319362819011
Collins's long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness.: 10.926778479382563
But as it is--you must not let your fancy run away with you.: 10.956672973405093
An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.: 12.60065763695386
But      last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.: 12.396232330461519
Mr.: 1.2049424672861444
Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.: 12.944060110742866
Let me never see either one or the other again!"  Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover.: 11.298708688033258
They agree with me in      apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be      injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady      Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves      with such a family.: 11.321484988542545
Not that I care about it, though.: 15.528254625099686
Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"  Mr.: 11.319947444197158
Tell him I hope he will      excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at      the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.: 13.728543798514762
Jane was not happy.: 15.127499226499916
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr.: 10.670318483937038
His coming into the country at all, is a most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.: 10.513635311073532
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"  "Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it.: 9.240163991072704
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with.: 11.143352166609953
Reynolds was of no trifling nature.: 10.840471451184607
And what do you think she said besides?: 9.266707290157493
'Ah!: 1.699644311120634
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.: 11.451215155985404
I will have no reserves from _you_." "Mr.: 8.099201516701887
The first mentioned      was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached      Mr.: 12.651347420404647
He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry.: 11.63241690741826
After a short pause, her companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with me.: 7.550771103002144
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me?: 11.077353698391653
"If it were merely a fine house richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful.: 9.28487991748195
The general prejudice against Mr.: 4.748634998926071
Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma?: 9.869983787501074
After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, "Is not this nice?: 11.094818076406249
It was agreed to.: 11.92087114837326
But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a way off.: 10.241168952853887
Bennet half opened the door and called out,  "Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."  Elizabeth was forced to go.: 9.528556396101349
I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now.: 8.997654995471663
My father is going to      London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her.: 10.55074907563946
He was on one side of her mother.: 11.643891690930758
That such a consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts."  "When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other."  "Not the slightest.: 11.386812182890862
An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure.: 9.4464081849319
Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!"  "Yes," thought Elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once.: 10.644278703172185
She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.: 13.55846166155668
Mrs.: 1.2472880342983486
Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.: 8.132035324043759
what felicity!: 8.125415960594593
So much the better.: 1.4850586524998688
As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"  "It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied."  At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs.: 10.350716231816495
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.: 10.210902590696858
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous.: 16.511531824317924
As they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen.: 10.037298023995039
Bennet exceedingly.: 5.354138929513536
I was in the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun."  "My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.: 12.302768648576425
Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son.: 12.24744987774943
You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt.: 11.821560742692808
Darcy found, on further enquiry, that      your father was still with him, but would quit town the next      morning.: 12.384743860269001

I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced."  Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London.: 8.936806595905866
Darcy.--_I_ talked about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples."  He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.: 10.029625897305374
Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her.: 8.695813657210863
Believe her to be deceived by all means.: 6.410792873371344
They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.: 6.7245467047740854
In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her.: 11.110088158184222
Presuming, however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.: 10.401091055397385
Mrs.: 1.2472880342983486
Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance."  "Not that I _shall_ though," she added to herself, as she finished the letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out."  Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.: 11.029837123654547
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.: 12.20659564132224
They had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had been in the way of procuring.: 10.364365388322463
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs.: 8.407052110039729
But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.: 9.762995069669739
If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.: 11.462164406072215
Kitty, run down and order the carriage.: 10.174759352300653
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.: 11.39714874962625
These were the contents:       "MY DEAR HARRIET,       "You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help      laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am      missed.: 12.079201763127836
Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object.: 13.083924545202544
I cannot think of it without abhorrence."  "We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening," said Elizabeth.: 11.668990117925853
Hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr.: 9.503063188778919
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.: 10.347993947806424
They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance.: 10.12193928696928
She cared for none      of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of      leaving Wickham.: 10.21887803930604
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.--Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.: 9.566248299592388
Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs.: 9.186532989858339
Mrs.: 1.2472880342983486
But I think Mr.: 8.597405878694353
There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much.: 10.729572069728775
Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct, I am sure.: 9.69138903415571
As they drove to Mr.: 7.217252691631712
Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,  "I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.: 10.145357001639468
"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.: 8.170430554598845
"Oh!: 1.8506496099686296
Have you never happened to see her there?"  She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.: 10.61228271981806
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.: 11.115801447180692

Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.: 9.848751222534911
She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience was severe.: 10.915388640887826
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned.: 11.15696520429472
and Mrs.: 1.0600473090678837
Mrs.: 1.2472880342983486
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it.: 8.941301903600568
They are gone off together from Brighton.: 11.357067476290467
"Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room."  She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held.: 10.831254951285612
Mrs.: 1.2472880342983486
Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family.: 10.104238156565339
She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome.: 12.044672307793203
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character.: 7.575556952733826
The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the door.: 10.722570061814462
And, above all things, keep Mr.: 8.256355684958434
My father supported him at school, and      afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own      father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have      been unable to give him a gentleman's education.: 10.579388937372933
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.: 12.071851091365064
He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him."  On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,  "Did not you think, Mr.: 11.652523585490433
Newby      Chief Executive and Director      gbnewby@pglaf.org  Section 4.: 11.52075234317598
No, no--I feel he may defy us there.: 14.910698384907771
In as short a time as Mr.: 8.526947215328539
His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.: 10.754477470163282
Mr.: 1.2049424672861444
The reason why all this was to be done by him      alone, was such as I have given above.: 11.29261952357519
There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.: 7.578012404260877
Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.: 12.098184206485262
As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents.: 7.300352986743577
Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself.: 11.640871978663252
You must contrive to send somebody.: 8.287609038147469
She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished.: 13.373560659712103
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.: 10.991879544579152
But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."  "If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your representation of all this, might make me quite easy.: 10.225303667721096
Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife."  "Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had.: 10.007169180640748
Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs.: 6.692895517779204
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.: 11.480810273963208
But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back, she should think herself very ill used.: 10.898294254674155
Will you tell me how long you have loved him?"  "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.: 10.782736273319566
As for their mother, Mr.: 6.798587385757269
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks.: 12.80535223651492
There was too much to be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects.: 11.521207121587013
"You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be completely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire."  "Oh!: 10.84118466951051
"My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else!: 10.525206289861712
Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all?: 9.542145913696148
Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.: 10.034119266073759
That is the place to get husbands.: 18.89461157344258
James's?"  "Never, sir."  "Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"  "It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it."  "You have a house in town, I conclude?"  Mr.: 9.761156531927744

Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.: 10.491375960822545
Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here, what he really is.: 12.066848791194658
And poor Mr.: 1.2049424672861444
Wickham himself?"  "No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton."  "This account then is what he has received from Mr.: 12.024174107077313
But I was not then      master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.: 10.025124116764244
The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to      say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are      discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.: 9.830351783848783
If there _were_ but such another man for you!"  "If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you.: 13.368307739048841
Mrs.: 1.2472880342983486
I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy."  To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr.: 11.13840993172377
They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.: 10.7434027722409
Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way.: 9.765107265790688
If, indeed, it should be so!: 10.756525043425638
CHAPTER XIX.: 1.3179356363614787
"Oh!: 1.8506496099686296
"John told us Mr.: 5.386206565791295
Mr.: 1.2049424672861444
Darcy.: 9.738681305547711
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.: 10.235213235999156
Darcy might leave the country, but that _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week.: 12.36760057727646
Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in      defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,      ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr.: 10.835952555420851
Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr.: 7.620322669071409
Mrs.: 1.2472880342983486
Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,  "I did not know before that you ever walked this way."  "I have been making the tour of the Park," he replied, "as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage.: 10.274973870631525
"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of the ball.: 13.059348031675194
"And is this all?" cried Elizabeth.: 13.777882537797884
Mr.: 1.2049424672861444
There is one point, on which I want your advice.: 13.006505799817985
I am most seriously displeased."  Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.: 9.446467142421849
The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.: 11.340795031676727
She finds Miss Pope a treasure.: 11.171384706572425
You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence which was no less his due than his desert.: 10.650168406197604
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.: 12.391157729783522
But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from the want of money.: 9.487931131994149
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.: 10.994853515624998
His plan did not vary on seeing them.--Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice.: 10.846758992984478
By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr.: 11.76467629819237
Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.: 12.575333998948977
"Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman."  "Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it."  "Oh!: 11.474155957540942
The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.: 12.339089441166117
She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.: 12.153437801203514
Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.: 9.510655318682774
It mortifies me.: 15.577741781762034
Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet.: 9.14123720365735
Mrs.: 1.2472880342983486
She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you.: 10.805068954771945
Your's, &c.: 3.708779185884678
Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.: 11.640428241977265
"I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs.: 7.224900688012029
"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs.: 8.256290718612561
Mr.: 1.2049424672861444
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."  "But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?"  "You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth, "and if upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him."  "How can you talk so?"--said Jane faintly smiling,--"You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate."  "I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion."  "But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required.: 10.278041764470027
my sweetest Lizzy!: 7.9165906878274175
Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other.: 13.316926955998547
Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.: 11.220727851037893
I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared      something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock      is over, shall I own that I long for your return?: 12.3627091114735
Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.: 11.401886886922597
You will be a very happy woman."  Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.: 13.07203991106095
If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.: 5.789300289843327
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable.: 12.7916011161097
Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post.: 13.792397697944422
Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me.: 9.711093113144141
He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."  "Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.: 12.488518829457883
In understanding Darcy was the superior.: 12.789486527763735
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away.: 9.408771151986295
Bennet, "you will wait on him of course."  "No, no.: 11.290215634426701
They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to.: 10.760556685968151
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.: 9.374845055234502
Bingley and his sisters."  Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.: 7.998705653511844
Since her father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education."  After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying,  "I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr.: 10.278124454705791
(Robert William) Chapman   This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.: 9.24477334216981
Indeed he has no improper pride.: 14.426825329954122
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.: 8.266963643436206
Darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse."  It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.: 14.312213626719359
My kind friends will      not hear of my returning home till I am better.: 11.060318743700918
Forster called her, and they were going to the camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public.: 11.25573414787901
CHAPTER XVII.: 1.3179356363614787
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.: 11.297412826197515
1.E.9.: 2.541423408512914
the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her, which would admit of a chair.: 11.682370890570274
CHAPTER XIX.: 1.3179356363614787
Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,  "But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer.: 11.525393560172029
When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.--Elizabeth's courage did not fail her.: 8.68259168029972
It is because he will not give himself the trouble."  "I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy, "of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.: 11.97403426112013
He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.: 11.314312647784082
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"  Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.: 12.891858637617371
Did you see it?"  Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.: 15.533436477171445
To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he _did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something about Mr.: 10.109690591871676
If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him, except a few presents.: 13.002196197252797
Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long."  "You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr.: 12.21692701768342
Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.: 10.939323790885949
He drew a chair near her.: 8.581716603252051
Bingley does not know Mr.: 5.1968517353655725
Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable.: 8.730609291858642
I am extremely      glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at      Hunsford.: 10.770772769445028
Oh!: 2.1281906869844955
I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at civility, I am thus rejected.: 10.241899778486493
"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he.: 9.865591230837252
Darcy.: 9.738681305547711
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing.--Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life.: 9.71314789488471
All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her again.: 11.918213823666553
As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters.: 9.250392947629134
She would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable.: 11.107215192423718
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too!: 10.711478779019542
It is from my cousin, Mr.: 9.31044018988465
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces.: 12.049415376948765
It was very little less.: 14.926850104554157
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.: 9.662289986721673
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.: 8.989472267751523
no, no, this is not likely.: 14.46846267675561
Darcy_, you see, is the man!: 19.960106522363414
If I wished to think slightingly of any body's children, it should not be of my own however."  "If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it."  "Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."  "This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.: 12.188370479545624
If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the least.: 9.428933975862797
She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks."  "But not before they went to Brighton?"  "No, I believe not."  "And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself?: 10.335172483405051
I was never more annoyed!: 19.842250799836503
It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed,  "How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr.: 10.376346482822516
Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.: 12.460578311684273
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.: 10.801030353341673
It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.: 12.225142872507949
His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade      her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her      friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,      offering his assistance, as far as it would go.: 10.782464617054938
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.: 10.811732393435646
Bingley is coming down, sister," (for Mrs.: 9.187144726369352
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves.: 9.11291453621585
But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr.: 9.541665242319954
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended.: 10.103905173051588
Are the others coming out?"  "I do not know.: 7.071326928521957
"I never heard any thing so abominable.: 9.631795858593637
He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal."  "True.: 11.56094092661038
Bingley in consequence of it, before _they_ did.: 10.780249077341994
The gentlemen did approach; and when Mr.: 7.724790163231049
Why must _she_ be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold?: 13.609082432714635
Gardiner?: 12.200875335560063
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.: 10.665865926247019
You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty.: 11.803996142012606
dear me!: 1.77628221169138
CHAPTER XVI.: 1.3179356363614787
That he has neither integrity nor honour.: 14.328040599219646
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs.: 8.86029378226616
He has also _brotherly_ pride, which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers."  "What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?"  He shook his head.--"I wish I could call her amiable.: 10.729915590893956
Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.: 10.493979037544227
"EDW.: 4.089965196792128
Jane was distressed.: 1.6200781116489917
Bennet and Mrs.: 1.0600473090678837
By the Author of "Sense and Sensibility."  VOL.: 12.696901588693825
"No; but it must be done soon."  Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote.: 9.427502554755623
Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"  Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.: 10.634750064641288
They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.: 10.626606295850173
I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.: 13.544937729726174
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances:--and to have Mr.: 9.977808212903481
She looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.: 7.423638146821785
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country." He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.: 9.987969645157392
When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs.: 5.655701839613804
Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr.: 8.549349771534542
Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least.: 12.869960879439791
And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing.: 11.55714021177119
His doing so drew her notice.: 8.48752631133544
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.: 10.515226490592568
Mr.: 1.2049424672861444
I often tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired, without constant practice.: 11.771666064182964
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that corps.: 12.63558682419584
She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung.: 10.659991896515917
Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.--The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be otherwise explained.: 10.502605053203242
You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas.: 19.341585378947883
The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary.: 18.268569347616815
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh.: 4.617959118338483
Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.: 12.323587218947655
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister.: 11.620683576463705
It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations.: 12.55924535125704
And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission!: 12.400119224576994
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house.: 9.871010198280372
_My_ affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever."  Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances.: 11.447280759429864
We had better not mention it.: 16.878872185034158
The promised letter of thanks from Mr.: 5.660324327412971
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both.: 10.672104273594755
Their society can afford no pleasure, that will atone for such wretchedness as this!: 12.065922034372942
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out.: 10.04800973458439
It was a fortnight since Mrs.: 9.013131010610879
With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations.: 11.159131044726116
Bingley, and under your orders."  "Oh!: 7.909202220115064
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.: 12.224832062679113
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.: 9.158821598671695
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return, brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.: 11.24079656320997
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week.: 11.378463581663935
Bennet.: 11.490938835167562
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs.: 8.216745094601874
These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber.: 8.157705079873173
Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.: 9.58156897041856
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition."  "Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."  "Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"  Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a moment's deliberation,  "I am not."  Lady Catherine seemed pleased.: 10.121696200440699
At such a time, much might have been said, and silence was very awkward.: 9.921358855751585
The very last evening was spent there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.: 9.893897006142291
He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security.: 12.179094709288066
I am afraid you will be angry."  "My dearest sister, now _be_ be serious.: 10.115594370864919
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr.: 8.11589008984568
This however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors.: 10.664731750481076
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner.: 8.603313852224716
I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married.: 10.044566416667328
Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.: 10.651557533862881
Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.: 9.020711878132138
Bennet replied that he had not.: 13.22913400986004
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expence.--"He is now gone into the army," she added, "but I am afraid he has turned out very wild."  Mrs.: 8.79591815068407
That lady I suppose is your mother."  Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.: 14.117927836209915
Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs.: 9.290627431195565
Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,  "Engaged to Mr.: 11.029862575944048
