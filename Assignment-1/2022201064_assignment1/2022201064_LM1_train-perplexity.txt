However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.: 2.5474914499730215
"My dear Mr.: 2.208617155396641
Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."  Mr.: 3.5078081908905463
Bennet made no answer.: 1.6361230618839049
"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."  This was invitation enough.: 4.022126430766421
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs.: 3.5410981634255747
Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr.: 2.282028513411971
Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."  "What is his name?"  "Bingley."  "Is he married or single?"  "Oh!: 2.9691462395557893
A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year.: 1.532298483669912
how can it affect them?"  "My dear Mr.: 2.061149656360085
Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome!: 3.1110126598099925
You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."  "Is that his design in settling here?"  "Design!: 3.5222945114844486
nonsense, how can you talk so!: 2.603995400546863
You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr.: 2.6686038548784365
Bingley might like you the best of the party."  "My dear, you flatter me.: 3.268126252478828
When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."  "In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."  "But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr.: 2.617235190291852
Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."  "It is more than I engage for, I assure you."  "But consider your daughters.: 3.3511535511395234
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new comers.: 2.132015938245474
Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not."  "You are over scrupulous surely.: 3.1681386990536673
Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."  "I desire you will do no such thing.: 2.7399228551725194
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia.: 2.9251155865086584
But you are always giving _her_ the preference."  "They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."  "Mr.: 2.107487006909967
Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?: 2.757613930309207
You take delight in vexing me.: 2.509365073885517
You have no compassion on my poor nerves."  "You mistake me, my dear.: 3.121056539223406
I have a high respect for your nerves.: 2.17370952776386
They are my old friends.: 0.9621758505989804
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."  "Ah!: 1.7083198470640346
you do not know what I suffer."  "But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."  "It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not visit them."  "Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all."  Mr.: 3.30757480571996
Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.: 2.057662103503784
_Her_ mind was less difficult to develope.: 2.205940829565039
The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.: 2.5453896961272147
CHAPTER II.: 0.7980798552021955
He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it.: 2.8804979317672625
It was then disclosed in the following manner.: 5.103149877478346
Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with,  "I hope Mr.: 2.6975704270113736
Bingley will like it Lizzy."  "We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr.: 2.8009105023967953
Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit."  "But you forget, mama," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs.: 3.5699524167325984
Long has promised to introduce him."  "I do not believe Mrs.: 3.0597811567814586
Long will do any such thing.: 1.5899438758932398
She has two nieces of her own.: 2.780649060353883
She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her."  "No more have I," said Mr.: 3.222410953160213
Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you."  Mrs.: 4.110125569524567
Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.: 2.4461769289304156
"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake!: 2.1748698074920103
Have a little compassion on my nerves.: 2.2956620918956077
You tear them to pieces."  "Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times them ill."  "I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully.: 2.288359274869983
Long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself."  "Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr.: 3.9330290595941677
Bingley to _her_."  "Impossible, Mr.: 1.583738249978057
Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teazing?"  "I honour your circumspection.: 2.555326848668114
A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little.: 1.8819252358126708
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight.: 2.105305405485098
But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs.: 1.8623527461295692
Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself."  The girls stared at their father.: 2.6727762427958552
Bennet said only, "Nonsense, nonsense!"  "What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he.: 2.244979400422507
"Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense?: 3.0042367921997997
I cannot quite agree with you _there_.: 1.3959521023558823
What say you, Mary?: 24.899635723833494
"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr.: 2.2211756899739625
Bingley."  "I am sick of Mr.: 4.667671863515572
Bingley," cried his wife.: 4.369442674913153
"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before?: 3.331731075336299
If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on him.: 3.6359565365103452
It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now."  The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.: 2.525683273067508
Bennet!: 1005.8753828437013
But I knew I should persuade you at last.: 2.619947211792654
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance.: 1.7161191864882253
Well, how pleased I am!: 1.8225862484148136
and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now."  "Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr.: 3.355607524948836
"What an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was shut.: 3.3441382064065084
"I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter.: 2.3814087811418254
At our time of life, it is not so pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing.: 2.9762538977512554
Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare say Mr.: 2.2703097508312093
Bingley will dance with you at the next ball."  "Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the youngest, I'm the tallest."  The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr.: 2.9246005779864586
Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.: 2.832899890939366
CHAPTER III.: 0.7980798552021955
Not all that Mrs.: 1.6315832741126157
Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr.: 2.896186496347463
Her report was highly favourable.: 1.283238406435405
Sir William had been delighted with him.: 1.530233833021887
He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party.: 3.597307640236438
Nothing could be more delightful!: 3.826498674652297
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr.: 1.8597482426918013
Bingley's heart were entertained.: 13.293218415803322
"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield," said Mrs.: 2.2477716712122238
Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for."  In a few days Mr.: 4.455612288818466
Bingley returned Mr.: 0.34073877072494585
Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library.: 3.7984729709524037
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.: 2.8195156875563128
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.: 2.840554123494621
Bennet was quite disconcerted.: 2.2268725679374444
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.: 2.9873269181318958
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr.: 2.36337450504446
Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.: 2.2120863503311083
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin.: 2.16237317150093
And when the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five altogether; Mr.: 1.7212889701389056
Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.: 2.4133392218299674
Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.: 2.2184696149465513
His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.: 2.1513834659131263
His brother-in-law, Mr.: 1.4151629710127047
Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.: 2.5646540275062066
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr.: 2.8070279773774707
Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.: 2.7294954417425403
Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.: 2.1666284020198296
What a contrast between him and his friend!: 2.801337039540198
Darcy danced only once with Mrs.: 1.3260506432625476
Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.: 2.8114818024211994
His character was decided.: 2.5387559142585396
He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.: 4.182320237349954
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs.: 1.3322330482360467
Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his having slighted one of her daughters.: 2.347931322542712
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.: 2.660718251226833
Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr.: 2.239393427436391
Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.: 3.437020997072796
"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance.: 4.526912540668457
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.: 1.6068363026093468
You had much better dance."  "I certainly shall not.: 3.768244228954849
You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner.: 2.0740125367640254
Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with."  "I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Bingley, "for a kingdom!: 4.003004192281968
Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty."  "_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr.: 2.609726865716462
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.: 2.2481588304457714
she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!: 2.0400082851310204
But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say, very agreeable.: 3.544988263540458
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you."  "Which do you mean?" and turning round, he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, "She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.: 2.469741603322527
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."  Mr.: 2.5025888969143173
Bingley followed his advice.: 1.216091769973963
Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.: 2.0408829673075024
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.: 1.601657125813637
Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.: 3.4410072615156686
Jane was as much gratified by this, as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.: 4.166226491676422
Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure.: 3.6416067593359647
They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.: 2.7902167653132555
They found Mr.: 0.34073877072494585
Bennet still up.: 0.9751978318816952
He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear.: 2.7792342449451337
my dear Mr.: 0.48871080625045427
Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.: 3.1954254912252265
I wish you had been there.: 2.0291194956483016
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.: 2.036593967387863
Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice.: 1.5055696774115315
Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time.: 2.897226033760266
First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.: 3.648661654683074
I was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance.: 3.35631154856894
So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.: 2.7395526865352933
Then, the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger----"  "If he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much!: 3.527628306635091
For God's sake, say no more of his partners.: 2.4323517696384385
my dear," continued Mrs.: 2.3120748106329576
Bennet, "I am quite delighted with him.: 5.495073605061543
and his sisters are charming women.: 1.902668910435575
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses.: 2.3634603676509243
I dare say the lace upon Mrs.: 3.6540676753018873
Hurst's gown----"  Here she was interrupted again.: 1.4047503572137943
Bennet protested against any description of finery.: 1.0635412880973705
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr.: 2.0875203318881828
"But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing.: 2.646045662934423
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him!: 2.6978564669784038
He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great!: 2.882782626822414
Not handsome enough to dance with!: 2.0381270579546236
I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set downs.: 3.536771542755339
I quite detest the man."     CHAPTER IV.: 1.428465767037138
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr.: 2.4939700146627306
Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him.: 2.604656431912689
"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!"  "He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can.: 2.993992164328988
I did not expect such a compliment."  "Did not you?: 4.47513685097508
_I_ did for you.: 1.4802062444235318
But that is one great difference between us.: 2.313217620528486
Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.: 1.3625673652766668
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room.: 2.2378846553840344
No thanks to his gallantry for that.: 2.1045608606575965
Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.: 3.3845120696608957
You have liked many a stupider person."  "Dear Lizzy!"  "Oh!: 1.9428955890998465
you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.: 3.6704323268385934
You never see a fault in any body.: 1.7479945895908835
All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes.: 1.960381496599821
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life."  "I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak what I think."  "I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.: 3.408193276446123
Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every where.: 1.4698561547319524
But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad--belongs to you alone.: 2.814027724000789
And so, you like this man's sisters too, do you?: 2.7382486516804625
Their manners are not equal to his."  "Certainly not; at first.: 2.8933016839134136
They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others.: 2.7650263387772767
They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.: 2.6551688973545766
Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it.--Mr.: 2.5242802060923597
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs.: 3.4875515871770224
Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.: 2.045187043027946
Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House.: 2.4020484289344335
He did look at it and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.: 2.342059057585049
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character.--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied.: 2.5704074606202885
On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion.: 2.4861618929870146
Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever.: 2.2587361741752487
He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.: 2.619524949488546
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence.: 1.6162573532423574
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic.: 1.924215840669346
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.: 2.795105146139706
Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure.: 2.143472521525323
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of.: 3.1233268636125397
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.: 2.527010804309426
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate.: 1.7515643690112095
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty.: 2.7404114537179227
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.: 0.9802547348558812
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.: 2.631976663949902
For though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to every body.: 2.9460845761461996
By nature inoffensive, friendly and obliging, his presentation at St.: 1.2127740072732724
James's had made him courteous.: 2.8091256408027108
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs.: 2.5263845758049426
Bennet.--They had several children.: 1.3344376667797386
The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth's intimate friend.: 2.2392609286574046
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.: 2.721153919173686
"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs.: 1.7358603992988346
Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas.: 1.9778840914957814
"_You_ were Mr.: 0.583182740622488
Bingley's first choice."  "Yes;--but he seemed to like his second better."  "Oh!--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice.: 3.407279754356717
Robinson; did not I mention it to you?: 2.6315180381522323
Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest?: 3.356483742380088
and his answering immediately to the last question--Oh!: 1.7193153028173735
the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point."  "Upon my word!--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know."  "_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza," said Charlotte.: 2.285291219287042
"Mr.: 0.8310454368834238
Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_."  "I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.: 2.5762469905465126
Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips."  "Are you quite sure, Ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?" said Jane.--"I certainly saw Mr.: 1.9644160779868916
Darcy speaking to her."  "Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to."  "Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance.: 2.7848048043926306
With _them_ he is remarkably agreeable."  "I do not believe a word of it, my dear.: 3.411661880492391
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs.: 3.6154674825635724
Long.: 11.602527070972203
But I can guess how it was; every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs.: 2.914533683959061
Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise."  "I do not mind his not talking to Mrs.: 3.0972125911421613
Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I wish he had danced with Eliza."  "Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with _him_, if I were you."  "I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him."  "His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it.: 3.1321724103999404
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour, should think highly of himself.: 2.755667904350749
If I may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud."  "That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_."  "Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, "is a very common failing I believe.: 2.583673487924934
By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary.: 2.6875858443161897
Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonimously.: 1.670949490063149
A person may be proud without being vain.: 1.5728011724253945
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."  "If I were as rich as Mr.: 2.1487927701881957
Darcy," cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters, "I should not care how proud I was.: 2.8822192869512913
I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day."  "Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs.: 2.4402459245172277
Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly."  The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.: 3.024140905133794
CHAPTER VI.: 0.6640040593848722
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.: 2.0185170044128733
The visit was returned in due form.: 1.261286430397123
Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs.: 1.869584180811948
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the two eldest.: 2.492845777357348
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.: 2.781140852870569
It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.: 2.9646896407825567
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.: 2.894416363358292
"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded.: 3.3895026717413317
If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark.: 2.8662642560197087
We can all _begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.: 1.98222049800781
In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels.: 1.6513961005616031
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."  "But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.: 3.012193089039089
If _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too."  "Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do."  "But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out."  "Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.: 3.3690521829323403
Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention.: 2.169037798101066
When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses."  "Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.: 2.759957789643265
But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.: 2.8252546725961825
As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness.: 3.1653239077829514
She has known him only a fortnight.: 1.8449950164167084
This is not quite enough to make her understand his character."  "Not as you represent it.: 2.9216699489117763
Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal."  "Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded."  "Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth.: 2.864910774443061
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.: 1.5167527104772185
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life."  "You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.: 2.377998312488181
You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."  Occupied in observing Mr.: 2.7363788956774653
Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.: 3.863557051828799
Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.: 3.0043277732368945
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.: 2.4114170716273864
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.: 1.2005226968104354
Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.: 3.0902876073078156
Of this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.: 2.320668714440737
He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.: 4.235741980418155
It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were assembled.: 4.0084971402865595
"What does Mr.: 1.0035234951370724
Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?"  "That is a question which Mr.: 2.7591392646968997
Darcy only can answer."  "But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about.: 3.631428408827563
"I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows."  "You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body!--If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers." On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, she added, "Very well; if it must be so, it must." And gravely glancing at Mr.: 2.9803011884625206
Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of course familiar with--'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and I shall keep mine to swell my song."  Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.: 2.287395898276854
After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.: 2.4366322839841117
Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.: 2.0362792531453775
Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.: 2.747464111226223
"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr.: 2.0657155012946182
Darcy!--There is nothing like dancing after all.--I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies."  "Certainly, Sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world.--Every savage can dance."  Sir William only smiled.: 2.2455147246329883
"Your friend performs delightfully;" he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;--"and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.: 2.26191547035924
Darcy."  "You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir."  "Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.: 3.2704034728590408
Do you often dance at St.: 1.088169435399884
Darcy bowed.: 31.172643442622945
"I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas."  He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her,  "My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?--Mr.: 2.7024139623419376
Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you." And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr.: 2.609825406180955
Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,  "Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.--I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."  Mr.: 2.8186438283011714
Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.: 1.939599525789147
"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half hour."  "Mr.: 2.907571667320102
Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling.: 4.22563858105236
"He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner?"  Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.: 2.2864542646890302
Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,  "I can guess the subject of your reverie."  "I should imagine not."  "You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.: 3.112422870709104
The insipidity and yet the noise; the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--What would I give to hear your strictures on them!"  "Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.: 2.2087993391816974
My mind was more agreeably engaged.: 1.6141001416492422
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."  Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.: 2.290927295805484
Darcy replied with great intrepidity,  "Miss Elizabeth Bennet."  "Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley.: 3.965027473955828
"I am all astonishment.: 6.839763801161806
How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am I to wish you joy?"  "That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.: 2.3235327014901306
A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.: 2.105863347529151
I knew you would be wishing me joy."  "Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled.: 2.870935446190004
You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you."  He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.: 2.9672494821877495
CHAPTER VII.: 0.6640040593848722
Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his.: 2.807757177363485
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.: 2.4498203991200302
Philips, who had been a clerk to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.: 3.6610064738365304
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way.: 2.3439762847357675
The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt.: 1.934359125839041
At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the head quarters.: 2.6934668205250927
Their visits to Mrs.: 1.1585117599164756
Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence.: 4.648340187697111
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections.: 1.8059043475453032
Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves.: 3.033180674287551
Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.: 2.940401178613334
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.: 1.8454312482339945
Bennet coolly observed,  "From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country.: 3.1121402719135856
Bennet, "that you should be so ready to think your own children silly.: 4.000277507855335
I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish."  "My dear Mr.: 2.2815776279876867
Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother.--When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.: 2.696493440289618
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals."  "Mama," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library."  Mrs.: 2.115290473793833
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer.: 2.6839785585041875
Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,  "Well, Jane, who is it from?: 3.888328119895647
what is it about?: 3.8738813100741014
what does he say?: 1.9021236458453392
Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."  "It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud.: 3.9298676380081363
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of      this.: 2.705879639051936
Yours ever,       "CAROLINE BINGLEY."  "With the officers!" cried Lydia.: 3.161598004635507
"I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_."  "Dining out," said Mrs.: 1.7824686082519554
"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night."  "That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home."  "Oh!: 3.070767678515915
but the gentlemen will have Mr.: 1.5116254920470746
Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs."  "I had much rather go in the coach."  "But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.: 3.2545907559351193
They are wanted in the farm, Mr.: 1.1652895052998653
Bennet, are not they?"  "They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them."  "But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose will be answered."  She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged.: 2.8026093166124713
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day.: 3.039614744737131
Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard.: 2.2608996963347177
Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.: 4.715287835706466
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back.: 1.75335122482747
Bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.: 3.1322412082620037
Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance.: 4.661960871006786
Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:       "My dearest Lizzy,       "I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be      imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.: 2.446970605264312
They insist also on      my seeing Mr.: 1.0527462841098092
Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear      of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache      there is not much the matter with me.: 2.9603388063974228
"Yours, &c."  "Well, my dear," said Mr.: 3.0907475045087054
Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr.: 3.1445548858653116
I am not at all afraid of her dying.: 4.291193840154653
People do not die of little trifling colds.: 1.4415645904242966
She will be taken good care of.: 2.520378300036974
As long as she stays there, it is all very well.: 5.020969899135177
I would go and see her, if I could have the carriage."  Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking was her only alternative.: 3.781573322072377
She declared her resolution.: 5.576456279668049
"How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt!: 4.0364591189431165
You will not be fit to be seen when you get there."  "I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want."  "Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the horses?"  "No, indeed.: 3.29914766752911
I do not wish to avoid the walk.: 7.29115393181695
The distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles.: 1.8002669809766805
I shall be back by dinner."  "I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."  "We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and Lydia.--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.: 2.5194907055868137
"If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes."  In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.: 2.564966181104264
She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.--That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs.: 2.5336939216515244
She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--Mr.: 2.8585905724657454
Hurst nothing at all.: 1.6905524202944653
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone.: 2.2649301127097505
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.: 1.8878931773261332
Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room.: 3.1483718400384912
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.: 2.35746088004973
She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with.: 2.587516743118752
Elizabeth silently attended her.: 1.4831157201640393
When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane.: 2.9502828774562873
The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.: 3.4961990226076347
The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.: 2.126703025099975
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere.: 2.4624777952861896
When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very unwillingly said so.: 2.427294674538556
Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.: 1.9835166790810512
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.: 1.9771051497236665
To the civil enquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr.: 2.2785696563084397
Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer.: 6.921421908483384
Jane was by no means better.: 3.0274676878861992
His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others.: 2.750706328867311
She had very little notice from any but him.: 1.4603413900845237
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr.: 2.0926299644507185
Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.: 2.8547857610451546
When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.: 3.1191706273601363
Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.: 2.6684953162793983
Hurst thought the same, and added,  "She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker.: 3.2481991035340423
I shall never forget her appearance this morning.: 1.9458454224766908
She really looked almost wild."  "She did indeed, Louisa.: 2.1478152756826607
I could hardly keep my countenance.: 1.9506254562145402
Very nonsensical to come at all!: 2.224453703273961
Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!"  "Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it, not doing its office."  "Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but this was all lost upon me.: 2.69800841101003
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well, when she came into the room this morning.: 2.852023530841996
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice."  "_You_ observed it, Mr.: 1.3694797165963115
Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition."  "Certainly not."  "To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!: 2.673271290307218
what could she mean by it?: 1.9287263211643129
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country town indifference to decorum."  "It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said Bingley.: 2.498099348630126
"I am afraid, Mr.: 5.400890237723758
Darcy," observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes."  "Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise."--A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs.: 2.69450846559593
Hurst began again.: 6.611472899484324
"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled.: 2.867021405023617
But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it."  "I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton."  "Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."  "That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.: 3.461006728588667
"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it would not make them one jot less agreeable."  "But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world," replied Darcy.: 2.903961600273533
To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.: 2.2466942351427153
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.: 2.5690505084429405
She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself.: 3.4079714315073026
Hurst looked at her with astonishment.: 6.238840133902728
"Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather singular."  "Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards.: 3.1355229071666373
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else."  "I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things."  "In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; "and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well."  Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying.: 2.9210098731037046
He immediately offered to fetch her others; all that his library afforded.: 2.374001679380444
"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever look into."  Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.: 2.7853500140644427
"I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left so small a collection of books.--What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr.: 2.772843789880363
Darcy!"  "It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many generations."  "And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books."  "I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these."  "Neglect!: 2.8417963696719366
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place.: 1.995129935712664
Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley."  "I wish it may."  "But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.: 2.944202361004013
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire."  "With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it."  "I am talking of possibilities, Charles."  "Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation."  Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr.: 2.4576540466485555
"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "will she be as tall as I am?"  "I think she will.: 2.679787722692297
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or rather taller."  "How I long to see her again!: 2.809074851452616
I never met with anybody who delighted me so much.: 1.6898012611809723
Such a countenance, such manners!: 2.0330427792213848
Her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite."  "It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished, as they all are."  "All young ladies accomplished!: 2.899942115321218
They all paint tables, cover skreens and net purses.: 4.12527852258335
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished."  "Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has too much truth.: 3.0567420370352822
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen.: 2.4382950078320174
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.: 2.629897352225191
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished."  "Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley.: 2.5659546804390545
certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with.: 2.361579633491668
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved."  "All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading."  "I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.: 2.4635654054022087
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_."  "Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all this?"  "_I_ never saw such a woman.: 2.9066682580118
_I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united."  Mrs.: 2.8469814354888157
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr.: 1.6969184190985662
As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.: 2.2059981318581534
"Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds.: 3.476941816248569
But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."  "Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, "there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.: 2.580134870513513
Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable."  Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.: 2.9615915984022356
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her.: 4.3816127330899315
Bingley urged Mr.: 0.34073877072494585
Jones's being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians.: 2.1803765514051827
This, she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that Mr.: 4.135368236299779
Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable.: 2.199005037526409
They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.: 2.3660322004427123
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr.: 3.060415833173963
Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters.: 3.0700573393756287
The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.: 1.3484781808610766
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs.: 1.5342507206665248
Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.: 2.3350870848146212
After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour.: 2.464625450715946
Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs.: 1.4464110313142733
Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.: 1.9617225781840673
"Indeed I have, Sir," was her answer.: 3.0609378156678217
"She is a great deal too ill to be moved.: 2.8589602791856765
Jones says we must not think of moving her.: 2.3597905683481186
We must trespass a little longer on your kindness."  "Removed!" cried Bingley.: 1.7120743431022016
Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.: 4.876052852508533
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_.: 1.5341648975809437
Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk.: 3.019401851553342
At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here."  "That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth.: 3.782359700171811
"You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her.: 2.712335553102001
yes--I understand you perfectly."  "I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful."  "That is as it happens.: 2.9306406764231787
It must be an amusing study."  "Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.: 2.9487984788026944
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society."  "But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever."  "Yes, indeed," cried Mrs.: 2.412856748144342
Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.: 2.27078808435714
"I assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town."  Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away.: 2.8204632168816257
"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part, except the shops and public places.: 2.320121350527254
The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr.: 2.452063552936707
Bingley?"  "When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same.: 4.4167269820900055
They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."  "Aye--that is because you have the right disposition.: 2.5640198504469502
But that gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing at all."  "Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother.: 3.8198590511709636
"You quite mistook Mr.: 1.9304037490348096
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true."  "Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger.: 2.8068781916989707
I know we dine with four and twenty families."  Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance.: 1.6393816268881538
His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards Mr.: 1.676503526412268
Darcy with a very expressive smile.: 2.120115840642396
Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.: 2.298423525494865
"Yes, she called yesterday with her father.: 3.7479606945721304
What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr.: 1.537008976051967
Bingley--is not he?: 1.5255963313271448
so much the man of fashion!: 3.5358255899804627
so genteel and so easy!--He has always something to say to every body.--_That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter."  "Did Charlotte dine with you?"  "No, she would go home.: 2.3594979617317295
I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies.: 2.5507768392107613
For my part, Mr.: 2.0258237137711363
Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently.: 1.2893888581065367
But every body is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I assure you.: 2.9356400400989826
It is a pity they are not handsome!: 4.238573658739649
Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend."  "She seems a very pleasant young woman," said Bingley.: 2.0567781638504674
dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain.: 2.815443033659249
I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see any body better looking.: 3.196200111654483
It is what every body says.: 3.053918578720861
When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.: 3.237564917367361
But however he did not.: 3.955252535199379
Perhaps he thought her too young.: 4.624544341870386
"There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.: 2.6618074739569133
I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"  "I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said Darcy.: 3.2505750958137023
"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.: 3.021172298947199
Every thing nourishes what is strong already.: 2.1446722319732476
But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."  Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.: 2.1954025958581704
She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.: 4.408254594513445
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr.: 1.228801629864644
Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy.: 3.370549770447976
Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required.: 1.9875019345436276
Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.: 2.366055422381599
Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.: 2.112262257353206
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr.: 3.429592509294596
Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.: 2.253395039840002
Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age.: 2.211902706696077
She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.: 2.739204883310058
She was very equal therefore to address Mr.: 1.3801136919523733
Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.: 3.0852254517709325
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.: 2.209656526344274
But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill."  Lydia declared herself satisfied.: 1.9230274683119906
yes--it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again.: 2.6861084215592967
I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."  Mrs.: 2.5272529409904236
Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr.: 2.423627676069337
Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.: 3.7683090332946674
CHAPTER X.: 0.6640040593848722
The day passed much as the day before had done.: 3.2828007905438614
The loo table, however, did not appear.: 5.782470632596438
Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister.: 2.831138300745857
Hurst and Mr.: 0.37126691704612974
Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.: 5.9413809052158255
Hurst was observing their game.: 0.9214199664788886
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion.: 2.4959607723621096
The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each.: 2.7872713362811004
I write rather slowly."  "How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year!: 2.1911154955769003
Letters of business too!: 1.2504011461746838
How odious I should think them!"  "It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours."  "Pray tell your sister that I long to see her."  "I have already told her so once, by your desire."  "I am afraid you do not like your pen.: 3.134537735136971
Let me mend it for you.: 1.5048468327634061
I mend pens remarkably well."  "Thank you--but I always mend my own."  "How can you contrive to write so even?"  He was silent.: 2.1978901178397696
"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's."  "Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?--At present I have not room to do them justice."  "Oh!: 2.777065495443481
it is of no consequence.: 2.606804734836461
I shall see her in January.: 3.3668891316885694
But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr.: 1.9710781370584165
He studies too much for words of four syllables.--Do not you, Darcy?"  "My style of writing is very different from yours."  "Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable.: 2.7062723913729734
He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."  "My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."  "Your humility, Mr.: 2.387832395642139
Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."  "Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of humility.: 2.6909194698284447
It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast."  "And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"  "The indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting.: 1.990441963304136
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance.: 2.6928535643928666
When you told Mrs.: 1.3023876047538885
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?"  "Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning.: 2.555189477912048
And yet, upon my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment.: 3.1542494005768917
At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies."  "I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity.: 3.229492392342465
Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not go--and, at another word, might stay a month."  "You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr.: 2.7964845975251458
Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition.: 3.0427334267581276
You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself."  "I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.: 2.4641245802053984
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could."  "Would Mr.: 2.689027641561103
Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"  "Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for himself."  "You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged.: 2.6337048546153876
Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety."  "To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you."  "To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either."  "You appear to me, Mr.: 2.573525609790585
Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection.: 1.9532963436914952
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr.: 3.0508769260524895
We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon.: 2.5128855687455776
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"  "Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?"  "By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of.: 2.4907147358934867
I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference.: 2.941556075078906
I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do."  Mr.: 2.478848498772218
Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh.: 3.0725438902700843
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.: 2.5097480264122227
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."  "What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.: 3.0720273645624774
Darcy had much better finish his letter."  Mr.: 2.0205672287668763
Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.: 2.2407454773015774
When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music.: 2.8810116088287425
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.: 2.057737352518497
Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr.: 2.2657427030030326
Darcy's eyes were fixed on her.: 3.7956379963603317
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange.: 3.0479001737472045
The supposition did not pain her.: 1.4247655622733348
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr.: 2.1363435678920677
Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her--  "Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?"  She smiled, but made no answer.: 2.708699832366035
He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.: 2.9119911317858924
"Oh!" said she, "I heard you before; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply.: 4.059366129467321
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if you dare."  "Indeed I do not dare."  Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.: 2.86038460714166
He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.: 2.613189241597244
Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.: 2.483709916679109
"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after the officers.--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses."  "Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"  "Oh!: 2.5729312414227903
yes.--Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley.: 2.1946781348994904
Put them next to your great uncle the judge.: 1.506359892869681
They are in the same profession, you know; only in different lines.: 2.6009743819580335
Hurst and Elizabeth herself.: 5.237634049939211
"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.: 3.9022648630086776
"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs.: 0.9714645975336167
Hurst, "in running away without telling us that you were coming out."  Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr.: 1.7886898380043834
Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said,--  "This walk is not wide enough for our party.: 1.3582460618346681
We had better go into the avenue."  But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered,  "No, no; stay where you are.--You are charmingly group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage.: 2.6172661256714767
Good bye."  She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two.: 2.74821208643372
Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.: 1.552150100801373
CHAPTER XI.: 0.6640040593848722
When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.: 2.708535892878955
Their powers of conversation were considerable.: 1.355538501066923
They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.: 1.6699627917228923
But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object.: 3.3288880010599375
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr.: 3.493990272156797
Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation.: 2.405981621215905
He was full of joy and attention.: 1.1512641390386762
He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.: 3.366209366128508
Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.: 2.0303300344492006
When tea was over, Mr.: 2.302137324326716
Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table--but in vain.: 1.9761971401481848
She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.: 0.8927430667042332
Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr.: 1.9635012925790987
Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected.: 1.0888260456118593
She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her.: 3.8366799684231108
Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs.: 1.8730932830388547
Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.: 2.2769078778804337
She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on.: 3.844248598215044
At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way!: 3.078501026499884
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!: 2.022661518348371
How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book!--When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library."  No one made any reply.: 3.201145457698868
She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said,  "By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield?--I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure."  "If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards."  "I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.: 2.6867741136193963
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day."  "Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball."  Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room.: 2.541572792591059
Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.: 3.500127110811661
In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to Elizabeth, said,  "Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room.--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude."  Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.: 3.1736106368413033
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr.: 1.9256751141599064
Darcy looked up.: 1.966654764463016
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.: 1.9555873830265456
He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing, that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere.: 2.2134467430526956
"What could he mean?: 24.258987756209706
"Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing about it."  Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr.: 2.8674218160869183
Darcy in any thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives.: 4.258468302053617
"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak.: 3.0820669448470985
shocking!" cried Miss Bingley.: 2.8718523219948886
How shall we punish him for such a speech?"  "Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth.: 2.834276218869377
"We can all plague and punish one another.: 1.361051086464071
Teaze him--laugh at him.--Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."  "But upon my honour I do _not_.: 3.0054026357659507
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_.: 1.8537350422207552
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind!: 1.736558140342893
And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.: 2.257947909348202
Darcy may hug himself."  "Mr.: 2.4468086773567252
I dearly love a laugh."  "Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be.: 2.5655518632494037
The wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions, may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke."  "Certainly," replied Elizabeth--"there are such people, but I hope I am not one of _them_.: 2.6371556301580465
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good.: 1.624931448663375
Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can.--But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without."  "Perhaps that is not possible for any one.: 2.7391213140202377
But pride--where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."  Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.: 2.60634384923352
"Your examination of Mr.: 0.9899301827314577
Darcy has no defect.: 1.5839728648920524
He owns it himself without disguise."  "No"--said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension.: 2.314472014639272
I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.: 2.7998687137258407
My temper I dare not vouch for.--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the convenience of the world.: 1.7124230183442062
I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself.: 2.224938108245953
My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.: 1.990079970228769
My temper would perhaps be called resentful.--My good opinion once lost is lost for ever."  "_That_ is a failing indeed!"--cried Elizabeth.: 1.704876934902907
"Implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character.: 2.699217674576548
But you have chosen your fault well.--I really cannot _laugh_ at it.: 1.833640644202666
You are safe from me."  "There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."  "And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body."  "And yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand them."  "Do let us have a little music,"--cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share.--"Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr.: 2.7166784620508557
Hurst."  Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for it.: 3.0325114675308944
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.: 2.288460707554535
CHAPTER XII.: 0.6640040593848722
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day.: 2.9490038144354815
Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before.: 2.6814408947925767
Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home.: 4.343642030282531
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr.: 2.4865041409652098
Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well.--Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr.: 2.2466472426212434
Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.: 3.3122903956796903
The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred.: 2.106738749446586
To Mr.: 0.9768423400212144
Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough.: 2.3853438299703225
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it.: 2.004097678305953
Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.: 2.9251314811430356
On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place.: 2.1144496285274283
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.--Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits.: 2.6865138758597866
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.: 1.8828283034062603
The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.: 2.87129206895701
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort.: 2.4704323248360356
Much had been done, and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.: 3.150743411328089
CHAPTER XIII.: 0.6640040593848722
Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party."  "Who do you mean, my dear?: 3.755945098538612
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her.: 2.598623370534046
I do not believe she often sees such at home."  "The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger." Mrs.: 2.8586742399398304
Bennet's eyes sparkled.--"A gentleman and a stranger!: 2.3589088056873053
It is Mr.: 0.598372464912502
Bingley I am sure.: 7.189092230018748
Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.: 3.8655095385860974
how unlucky!: 2.6653142766801015
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.: 2.0945061589967686
Lydia, my love, ring the bell.: 1.97856156663372
I must speak to Hill, this moment."  "It is _not_ Mr.: 2.6361510563120962
Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life."  This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.: 3.002697018730583
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.: 2.6673792050490484
"About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention.: 2.330300214695226
Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."  "Oh!: 3.080332584270592
my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.: 3.7631513808923076
Pray do not talk of that odious man.: 2.0971362596091265
I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it."  Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.: 3.323725606038744
They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs.: 2.494221390840278
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.: 2.499608908069002
"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr.: 2.492194353386553
Bennet, "and nothing can clear Mr.: 2.976146229389876
But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself."  "No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.: 4.518586069898515
Bennet."--My mind however is now made up on      the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been      so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right      Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh,      whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable      rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to      demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be      ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are      instituted by the Church of England.: 2.3737886888653477
As a clergyman, moreover, I      feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in      all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds      I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly      commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the      entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,      and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch.: 2.2864576711111546
I cannot be      otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your      amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to      assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but      of this hereafter.: 2.4978453194411614
If you should have no objection to receive me      into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on      you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and      shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday      se'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as      Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a      Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the      duty of the day.: 2.062036599903931
I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to      your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,       WILLIAM COLLINS."  "At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman," said Mr.: 2.1838307380630315
Bennet, as he folded up the letter.: 8.756793583652234
"He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again."  "There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him."  "Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit."  Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.: 2.906646100959338
"I cannot make him out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he would help it, if he could.--Can he be a sensible man, sir?"  "No, my dear; I think not.: 2.474578746623411
I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse.: 2.048307617212819
There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well.: 3.45128296055565
I am impatient to see him."  "In point of composition," said Mary, "his letter does not seem defective.: 3.5327811788257137
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed."  To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting.: 2.15943489886923
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.: 2.2828720236167155
Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which astonished her husband and daughters.: 3.133976935878379
Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family.: 3.5969454453266962
Bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr.: 2.8460938122561217
Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.: 1.7549687186388432
He was a tall, heavy looking young man of five and twenty.: 2.2029890168496187
He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs.: 2.0140470223110265
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but Mrs.: 4.371549039769796
Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,  "You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough.: 3.083700374920283
Things are settled so oddly."  "You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate."  "Ah!: 3.36910776190738
sir, I do indeed.: 6.783531191266836
Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things I know are all chance in this world.: 2.0395309033150397
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed."  "I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate.: 2.924285275565849
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them.: 2.324366042295233
At present I will not say more, but perhaps when we are better acquainted----"  He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other.: 2.626177182218911
They were not the only objects of Mr.: 2.6893680886137847
Collins's admiration.: 7.318199108682954
The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs.: 2.4755377882488925
Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.: 2.5467140279341764
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery was owing.: 2.265404858549379
But here he was set right by Mrs.: 1.1802546123275794
Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.: 4.151733889115879
He begged pardon for having displeased her.: 1.2631160586969075
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.: 2.2212827137671716
CHAPTER XIV.: 0.6640040593848722
Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.: 2.931461862653135
Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable.: 2.0179719137623997
Bennet could not have chosen better.: 5.287297072758987
The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine.: 2.583960922603067
She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of preaching before her.: 4.326723544380879
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.: 2.2717405841000935
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.: 2.4548600448696813
"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs.: 3.370920469521584
Bennet, "and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman.: 4.655579145972619
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her.: 2.099533288427095
Does she live near you, sir?"  "The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence."  "I think you said she was a widow, sir?: 2.2990192048839853
has she any family?"  "She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property."  "Ah!" cried Mrs.: 2.836218793520803
Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than many girls.: 1.755881939810539
And what sort of young lady is she?: 2.467112998155418
is she handsome?"  "She is a most charming young lady indeed.: 2.651087114472031
Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth.: 1.9945979922387158
She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them.: 2.3024980758884257
But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."  "Has she been presented?: 2.3327020395748974
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court."  "Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament.: 2.2986672936771946
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies.: 2.320105864296635
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her.--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay."  "You judge very properly," said Mr.: 2.656349966567347
Bennet, "and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.: 3.3903608459053447
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?"  "They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible."  Mr.: 2.0356362950045157
Bennet's expectations were fully answered.: 2.29002730394658
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.: 2.386901079566629
Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.: 2.696134855083803
Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels.--Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed.--Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons.: 2.2012368203659762
Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with,  "Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard, and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.: 2.8669476691461337
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday.: 2.1564269765111206
I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr.: 4.0414048974733205
Denny comes back from town."  Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.: 2.1555352306677005
Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,  "I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.: 1.9769049697771712
It amazes me, I confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction.: 2.3982890206786704
But I will no longer importune my young cousin."  Then turning to Mr.: 2.085526578620571
Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon.: 2.036293784759288
Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.: 2.147067272565833
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr.: 2.96036006730444
Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr.: 1.6379213048047607
Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.: 2.90773601202932
Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance.: 2.931798506530265
The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity.: 2.488619424578503
Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.: 2.6603667395521
This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.: 2.210560345115062
Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.--"As to her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her _eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."  Mr.: 2.3211561349368997
Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon done--done while Mrs.: 1.985878626639581
Bennet was stirring the fire.: 6.994678615987928
Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.: 1.576528850968981
Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces.: 3.451352782285784
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr.: 2.835261965519324
Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr.: 2.2748292965088086
Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr.: 3.528076605383464
Collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.: 3.1446940897186515
Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.: 3.828016892759202
Such doings discomposed Mr.: 0.5155050413442251
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr.: 2.8127576462498562
Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr.: 1.956652078231476
Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go.: 1.7714668708255714
In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.: 2.197810536640435
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recal them.: 2.018778935197846
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way.: 2.604570474325496
The officer was the very Mr.: 1.4487213123301907
Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed.: 2.029438900532436
All were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot.: 2.034418795678306
Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr.: 2.8290040417045867
Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps.: 2.9747939234372076
This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.: 2.8399055093605945
His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.: 2.5088569383917125
On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities.: 2.5396505613763685
Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.: 2.9216028136098218
Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red.: 1.731294824285477
Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr.: 1.6049491602664974
Darcy just deigned to return.: 1.3163684281946688
What could be the meaning of it?--It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.: 2.878226754422049
In another minute Mr.: 0.5641665155323395
Denny and Mr.: 0.37126691704612974
Philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the invitation.: 1.6959241445777156
Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr.: 3.206383542229464
Jones's shop boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr.: 2.971508653365945
Collins by Jane's introduction of him.: 2.6701045287036913
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr.: 2.430641592699304
Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the ----shire.: 5.371063834219151
She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.: 3.7463845862195506
Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid, disagreeable fellows." Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.: 2.4425791080146033
Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening.: 2.9441479827939934
This was agreed to, and Mrs.: 2.0121380342176516
Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.: 2.0732487971921936
As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.: 2.9065615119544135
Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs.: 1.4350343861038795
Bennet by admiring Mrs.: 0.5370790736461536
Philips's manners and politeness.: 3.356210887864491
He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before.: 3.069270398625293
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.: 3.051749798698811
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr.: 2.7949738440280596
Collins's scruples of leaving Mr.: 2.018192451848562
Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr.: 2.4289508711880625
Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house.: 3.514308234083364
When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.: 2.0168532024866175
Philips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room.: 2.3424523322752173
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.: 2.9367631436436508
Philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could.: 2.575799718273082
To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.: 2.6466053458601966
It was over at last however.: 1.8255790005278287
The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr.: 2.6114637149020377
Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.: 2.7158656505919128
Wickham and the officers, Mr.: 2.8708059388306912
Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs.: 2.022887477997144
When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her in return, by sitting down to whist.: 2.6875484102958227
"I know little of the game, at present," said he, "but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" Mrs.: 3.1429407742549627
Philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.: 2.1477625237002425
At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in particular.: 2.802644403799853
Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr.: 3.8616546291604754
Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr.: 3.2443580542070043
She dared not even mention that gentleman.: 2.3428372456713324
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved.: 1.0225209662879684
Wickham began the subject himself.: 2.0375905342472698
He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in an hesitating manner how long Mr.: 2.3876051844565866
Darcy had been staying there.: 10.393059134687094
"About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand."  "Yes," replied Wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one.: 2.9780299796635292
A clear ten thousand per annum.: 1.3063284752689628
"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday.--Are you much acquainted with Mr.: 2.154136584374107
I am not qualified to form one.: 2.6427331754024372
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.: 2.8934200199754634
It is impossible for _me_ to be impartial.: 2.1211976188482047
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else.--Here you are in your own family."  "Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.: 2.38784122525506
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire.: 3.117429914238451
Every body is disgusted with his pride.: 1.946656613885015
You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one."  "I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen.: 3.119364267557289
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen."  "I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man." Wickham only shook his head.: 2.3683950265862905
"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer."  "I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield.: 3.4253335185474936
I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."  "Oh!: 3.0040812730319053
no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr.: 2.3137325463041902
If _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go.: 2.3674870753149255
We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.: 2.796928712363104
His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr.: 3.0116083433140766
Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr.: 4.031293381120169
Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections.: 1.4580995589855479
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father."  Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.: 2.5085005318619307
"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.: 2.9698769002010548
Society, I own, is necessary to me.: 2.393395735213166
I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude.: 3.407055364978886
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible.: 2.164030728562822
Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift.: 2.731085642536978
He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.: 4.611369923728279
I cannot do justice to his kindness.: 1.6018636172146887
He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere."  "Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be?--How could his will be disregarded?--Why did not you seek legal redress?"  "There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law.: 2.8932171204248425
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr.: 2.5447686678936394
Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.: 2.275112827830918
Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it.: 2.9735370657018536
I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely.: 3.3319667780922804
I can recal nothing worse.: 1.6613382898972353
"But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"  "A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy.: 1.9843967929670332
Had the late Mr.: 0.68571004778752
Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life.: 2.24382706828087
Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!"  After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, "I _do_ remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.: 3.1393402712654197
His disposition must be dreadful."  "I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham, "_I_ can hardly be just to him."  Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his father!"--She could have added, "A young man too, like _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented herself with "And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!"  "We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.: 2.646543945377976
_My_ father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr.: 1.5665264150536211
Philips, appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr.: 2.21048661962014
Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property.: 2.8000221884994776
He was most highly esteemed by Mr.: 1.2448907462880576
Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend.: 3.0118641177060614
Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance, and when immediately before my father's death, Mr.: 2.7229261618104825
Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself."  "How strange!" cried Elizabeth.: 2.831781350658807
"How abominable!--I wonder that the very pride of this Mr.: 1.7899249882850148
Darcy has not made him just to you!--If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty I must call it."  "It _is_ wonderful,"--replied Wickham,--"for almost all his actions may be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend.: 2.2430656227007626
It has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor.: 1.5707804100656753
Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this.: 3.995317661064029
Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.: 3.1296766728518395
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy.: 2.4301613688603654
But she is too much like her brother,--very, very proud.--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.: 2.637278788038437
How can Mr.: 0.34073877072494585
Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?: 3.0321078764725535
Bingley?"  "Not at all."  "He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man.: 3.17445281770907
He cannot know what Mr.: 1.5790602350207583
Darcy is."  "Probably not;--but Mr.: 1.259543268901731
Darcy can please where he chuses.: 1.4621456641015627
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while.: 1.9140428640145448
Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.: 3.8840307284586992
Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs.: 1.8437893277478399
Philips.--The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter.: 2.069314511811956
It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs.: 3.347827580084436
Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy.: 2.7675238703980063
"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.: 2.5388858939445247
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters."  Mr.: 2.5569065267062028
Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.: 2.1796197871045573
"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a living.: 3.077434182333657
I hardly know how Mr.: 2.2221568335956285
Darcy."  "No, indeed, I did not.--I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections.: 4.390342582316395
Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined to another.: 2.5232531469980466
"Mr.: 0.8310454368834238
Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."  "I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.: 3.303438540980078
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class."  Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.: 2.416149687878983
Wickham's attentions.: 22.264782992502465
There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs.: 1.8478275824539911
Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every body.: 2.9832092101732397
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.: 2.4140148917317577
She could think of nothing but of Mr.: 1.9976556930343823
Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr.: 3.175836982633083
Collins were once silent.: 0.921476012554908
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won, and Mr.: 1.8310454353006542
Collins, in describing the civility of Mr.: 1.4544256363492498
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr.: 2.649847563696419
Wickham and herself.: 1.7936173950186476
Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.: 1.60008705938587
"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea.: 3.107279862827167
Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other.: 1.7206826397142818
It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side."  "Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody."  "Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.: 2.554395340351668
My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr.: 1.6304285570055619
No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.: 2.933652527919101
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?: 1.612615218276767
oh!: 1.9503150813050942
no."  "I can much more easily believe Mr.: 3.5334657155891
Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr.: 3.7590564415745167
Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.--If it be not so, let Mr.: 2.2692853075911295
Darcy contradict it.: 5.226359117804483
Besides, there was truth in his looks."  "It is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--One does not know what to think."  "I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think."  But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.: 2.1774316590962837
Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.: 2.6034292180481917
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr.: 2.7046021374803537
Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday.: 2.69341480618446
The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation.: 2.17372401090842
To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs.: 2.1033178258682725
Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.: 4.316485829132393
They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs.: 1.499176132618504
Bennet's civilities.: 8.673760501098313
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family.: 2.767902117669771
Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr.: 2.4251394646920295
Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card.: 2.8376403533727372
Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.: 3.598633115154608
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr.: 4.333058637998983
Darcy's looks and behaviour.: 4.930273972997124
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia, depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr.: 1.95066398326679
Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was at any rate, a ball.: 3.707205385257472
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it.: 2.807086525388288
"While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough.--I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.: 2.357786470947674
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body."  Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr.: 3.1009657662206074
Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr.: 2.637643894129029
Bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.: 3.9480264228407
"I am by no means of opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her."  Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.: 2.7308540440081512
Collins instead!: 3.141832314823249
her liveliness had been never worse timed.: 1.2553044794602854
Wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer, and Mr.: 3.0736674785918305
Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.: 4.261695789373115
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--It now first struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.: 2.4444753712982985
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_.: 2.4956419370995806
Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply.: 2.1977256657371296
Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.: 2.32909367082276
No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy.: 2.0446773121149593
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr.: 1.5821732363498913
Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia.: 3.02900070246534
CHAPTER XVIII.: 0.6640040593848722
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr.: 1.9529431046015944
Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.: 3.0204103054546194
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her.: 2.274520650807573
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr.: 1.6573568567334953
Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr.: 2.8614737271154915
Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,  "I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."  This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.: 2.6884001625691205
Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.: 1.3592759510021504
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.: 3.298867965308668
Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.: 1.820039902392435
The moment of her release from him was ecstacy.: 1.5705898127504176
She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.: 3.239008437671617
Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him.: 3.154442442964983
He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her.: 2.7164396314323427
"I dare say you will find him very agreeable."  "Heaven forbid!--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me such an evil."  When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.: 2.473166432143559
Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr.: 2.2524917292080637
Darcy, and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.: 1.5205137644556739
He replied, and was again silent.: 8.649595113283528
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with  "It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr.: 2.288588186703286
"Very well.--That reply will do for the present.--Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.--But _now_ we may be silent."  "Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"  "Sometimes.: 1.808540912499336
One must speak a little, you know.: 3.9505518753494964
It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible."  "Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?"  "Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds.--We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."  "This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure," said he.: 2.8736338609602923
"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.--_You_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."  "I must not decide on my own performance."  He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton.: 2.7745641420157092
She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance."  The effect was immediate.: 2.2212191640969325
At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said,  "Mr.: 2.598379027550511
Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is less certain."  "He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied Elizabeth with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life."  Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.: 2.8838009458197935
Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.: 2.47234893224308
"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir.: 4.251190387031427
Such very superior dancing is not often seen.: 1.7696847605667867
It is evident that you belong to the first circles.: 2.6379658680801477
Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place.: 2.815968631714256
What congratulations will then flow in!: 1.1460924915743407
I appeal to Mr.: 1.8679384583308858
Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said,  "Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."  "I do not think we were speaking at all.: 2.775298779841615
Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.--We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine."  "What think you of books?" said he, smiling.: 2.5512299154563136
"Books--Oh!: 0.8007146917849998
no.--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings."  "I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions."  "No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else."  "The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?" said he, with a look of doubt.: 2.7732922173451566
"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr.: 2.9688409370750772
Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable.: 3.7044168683514496
You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being created_."  "I am," said he, with a firm voice.: 5.297048660635188
"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"  "I hope not."  "It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first."  "May I ask to what these questions tend?"  "Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity.: 2.3133666311541217
"I am trying to make it out."  "And what is your success?"  She shook her head.: 3.4646887413929526
"I do not get on at all.: 3.216126511214372
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.: 2.4166128636658906
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,  "So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!--Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.: 2.6481019133240142
Darcy's steward.: 8.523217857585255
Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr.: 2.60640477760744
Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr.: 3.1714804727458823
Darcy in a most infamous manner.: 1.8644115167804727
I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr.: 4.930436763543691
Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.: 3.210400366079769
I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better."  "His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr.: 2.3377034852086473
Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself."  "I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.: 3.556349971714878
"Excuse my interference.--It was kindly meant."  "Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself.--"You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.: 1.765316880622718
I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.: 1.4475338349162792
Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley.: 3.553676359837891
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.: 3.126711204141753
"I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr.: 3.707632658691678
Wickham.: 14.794541451973775
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon."  "No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you.: 3.5527106241671147
Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr.: 2.512399420375047
Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr.: 3.74694494898926
Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr.: 1.153613706801879
Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's, Mr.: 4.0859830764015515
Wickham is by no means a respectable young man.: 2.389613723453142
I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr.: 2.648160865862877
Darcy's regard."  "Mr.: 4.009864521771547
But what does he say of the living?"  "He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr.: 2.419827082501793
Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only."  "I have not a doubt of Mr.: 4.665913465055857
Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly; "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.: 2.866755551616065
Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before."  She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment.: 2.705209705162267
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it.: 2.8020825417325987
On their being joined by Mr.: 1.6932878385984111
Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr.: 1.941778553648148
Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.: 3.4697114717594135
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine.: 2.6675461288341524
How wonderfully these sort of things occur!: 1.5268488747830349
Who would have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly!--I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.: 1.980016607821072
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."  "You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr.: 2.0165757431820093
Darcy?"  "Indeed I am.: 4.836464532907512
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.: 1.32430347557466
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_.: 4.367598899534132
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night."  Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that Mr.: 2.664753958896927
Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance.--Mr.: 1.9410890063558293
Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus,  "My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained.: 2.6372476269392298
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself." And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.: 1.9913681180592342
Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.: 2.5266673639825084
Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology," "Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh."--It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man.: 2.983238524379326
Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr.: 3.0924316609333853
Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.: 2.3473284077633454
Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr.: 3.2801980609909838
Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.: 2.4614568481042127
Collins then returned to Elizabeth.: 4.176248593656955
"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my reception.: 3.631150866102449
Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.: 2.662692501833102
He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.: 2.815781039386756
It was really a very handsome thought.: 3.20555169848625
Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."  As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr.: 2.9374749308955663
Bingley, and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane.: 2.7834509216818244
She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters.: 2.277627200691515
Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much.: 2.2172829335536965
When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr.: 2.2573480223542055
His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do.: 3.639883200153898
It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.: 3.2903948281581172
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.: 2.240906486410558
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.: 2.02940266644258
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr.: 2.542455465302682
Darcy, who sat opposite to them.: 3.535147639891578
Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.: 3.6880012121565398
"What is Mr.: 3.570938895781294
Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?: 5.065610585438805
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear."  "For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.--What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr.: 2.1538673282712955
Darcy?--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing."  Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.: 2.867679279340656
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.: 2.3241863716144358
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.: 1.1507592217017832
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr.: 2.106412067727181
Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.: 3.2672479942122803
At length however Mrs.: 0.6017721659048169
Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.: 2.786024484262375
Elizabeth now began to revive.: 2.5859780261658116
But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company.: 2.449430107480977
By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.: 2.300640287809041
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.: 2.3737423041994936
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected.--Elizabeth was in agonies.: 2.3456935131008394
She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley.: 3.5825666876703903
She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however impenetrably grave.: 2.9168694999894007
She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night.: 2.096494300221104
He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,  "That will do extremely well, child.: 2.5709014171765956
You have delighted us long enough.: 1.328390061371992
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."  Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to.: 2.945580453636554
"If I," said Mr.: 2.525657609434701
Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.: 2.4696026265625095
The rector of a parish has much to do.--In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron.: 2.7884356585908674
He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible.: 2.5932368393914795
And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.: 2.4917628510154675
I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family." And with a bow to Mr.: 2.488313086128752
Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--Many stared.--Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.: 1.9768159187722751
Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr.: 1.5010537018815198
Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.: 3.1859751717004063
To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.: 2.5701127900385945
That his two sisters and Mr.: 1.674943599104166
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement.: 2.3720425553300517
She was teazed by Mr.: 3.7934045117260577
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.: 2.433292781685136
He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening.: 3.2669241294761253
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr.: 2.5148425775957963
Collins's conversation to herself.: 3.6224315673881518
Darcy's farther notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.: 2.4860610335575464
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr.: 3.589012960198403
Wickham, and rejoiced in it.: 4.5405061485712865
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manoeuvre of Mrs.: 3.1544998215121383
They repulsed every attempt of Mrs.: 1.4262984172950588
Collins, who was complimenting Mr.: 4.823062159242817
Darcy said nothing at all.: 1.7757251747758
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs.: 1.0107927246347908
Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord, how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn.: 1.9047623672945224
Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr.: 2.00382219498621
Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation.: 2.6208964523828207
Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.: 2.812301483391278
Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four months.: 2.3820339114835694
Of having another daughter married to Mr.: 1.5433903891389416
Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.: 3.2023990460837153
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr.: 2.5964777805364903
Bingley and Netherfield.: 1.4835471357002052
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.: 2.145743483232534
Collins made his declaration in form.: 1.0523014967676982
Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.: 2.8881683235207527
On finding Mrs.: 0.3696835940944126
Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,  "May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?"  Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs.: 3.295650217555044
Collins must excuse me.--He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear.: 3.0085296399841557
I am going away myself."  "No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.--I desire you will stay where you are."--And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added, "Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.: 2.149185610669731
Collins."  Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion.: 2.467034105044709
Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone Mr.: 3.184871310506466
Collins began.: 3.5050410365998848
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother's permission for this address.: 2.2876682934160817
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.: 1.7617445906462204
Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life.: 1.977352317758454
Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued:  "My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish.: 2.1252487556532453
Secondly, that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.: 2.691011468047153
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs.: 2.009996591219984
Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr.: 3.31881051400529
Collins, you must marry.: 6.183126193600529
A clergyman like you must marry.--Chuse properly, chuse a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way.: 1.919952770233093
Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer.: 3.068690482723656
You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.: 1.9905349970260355
Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I assure you there are many amiable young women.: 1.8886218772031111
But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years.: 2.918838242049467
This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.: 3.121588744459822
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection.: 2.0828883666735964
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents.: 2.3958472818937504
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.: 2.6892558740473653
On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."  It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.: 2.309085330725276
"You are too hasty, Sir," she cried.: 4.667648775557
"You forget that I have made no answer.: 2.8089278152041954
Let me do it without farther loss of time.: 1.781165037153401
Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me.: 1.7880988907452533
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."  "Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration.: 2.512529086614871
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time.: 1.8954344924685205
Collins very gravely--"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you.: 2.814896221156477
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualifications."  "Indeed, Mr.: 2.538792476666452
Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.: 1.8477038391864202
I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.: 2.488639112918551
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.: 2.5715066670790216
Collins thus addressed her,  "When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character."  "Really, Mr.: 2.4372103820785793
Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me exceedingly.: 3.6937204845357394
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one."  "You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.: 2.53987172872763
My reasons for believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable.: 1.8156027462675552
My situation in life, my connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.: 2.472511557336698
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.: 2.342058478882335
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."  "I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.: 2.8992774735334237
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.: 1.8055352745409408
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.: 2.643008525090618
My feelings in every respect forbid it.: 2.0746339811904044
Can I speak plainer?: 2.675101176680349
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart."  "You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable."  To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.: 2.135332777219871
CHAPTER XX.: 1.1580587750183466
Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.: 1.9657945875649607
Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.: 2.3460241940181183
This information, however, startled Mrs.: 3.2191544883136003
Bennet;--she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so.: 3.3172630027734904
"But depend upon it, Mr.: 1.384558192664301
Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall be brought to reason.: 2.5653463772837553
I will speak to her about it myself directly.: 1.9258585088878593
She is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will _make_ her know it."  "Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam," cried Mr.: 2.7529858791576958
If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."  "Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs.: 2.12715154120557
Bennet, alarmed.: 31.172643442622945
"Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.: 1.5274705609625572
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived.: 2.4809082297207965
I will go directly to Mr.: 1.9692151816851202
Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.: 3.6142569539636327
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr.: 1.2620433339877104
Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_."  Mr.: 3.2149005371522175
Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication.: 2.3488295729180453
"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had finished her speech.: 3.795243171544575
"Of what are you talking?"  "Of Mr.: 2.419912008668171
Collins and Lizzy.: 1.5218059180652075
Lizzy declares she will not have Mr.: 2.0146646504340535
Collins, and Mr.: 4.5547558434158955
Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy."  "And what am I to do on the occasion?--It seems an hopeless business."  "Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.: 2.7129543566208127
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him."  "Let her be called down.: 2.338106433063849
She shall hear my opinion."  Mrs.: 1.2735846468141938
Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.: 3.861355640696638
"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared.: 3.140028468953027
"I have sent for you on an affair of importance.: 2.4936186099226525
I understand that Mr.: 1.359252626935982
Collins has made you an offer of marriage.: 2.1631293309033626
Is it true?" Elizabeth replied that it was.: 2.5343482448389953
"Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?"  "I have, Sir."  "Very well.: 3.199645863010799
We now come to the point.: 2.8766055970468316
Your mother insists upon your accepting it.: 1.5220133682715076
Is not it so, Mrs.: 2.8083130807209553
Bennet?"  "Yes, or I will never see her again."  "An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.: 3.064495378709174
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents.--Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr.: 2.617726218033077
Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_."  Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but Mrs.: 2.7911586139787685
"What do you mean, Mr.: 1.99206899122298
Bennet, by talking in this way?: 2.6072179514285105
You promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him."  "My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to request.: 3.1287740884351276
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room.: 2.5977241897330456
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be."  Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs.: 3.895604037481535
Bennet give up the point.: 2.8122782979187777
She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.: 4.269065954214502
Though her manner varied however, her determination never did.: 1.3282562562068918
Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.: 1.64629967946666
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way.: 2.1178239751043604
His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.: 2.6168370083485817
While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them.: 2.355714495061817
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr.: 2.5616920981115525
Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him."  Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs.: 3.11882207509594
Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family.: 3.05143717643316
"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves."  Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.: 2.652381643493408
"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs.: 1.4631262652262
Bennet, "looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way.--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead.--_I_ shall not be able to keep you--and so I warn you.--I have done with you from this very day.--I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word.: 2.8369562364092076
I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children.--Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body.: 2.8499745729721075
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking.: 1.8771179839931056
Nobody can tell what I suffer!--But it is always so.: 2.8772485291618604
Those who do not complain are never pitied."  Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.: 1.703177899361213
She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr.: 3.1544275522069603
Collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,  "Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let Mr.: 3.5534265482014122
Collins and me have a little conversation together."  Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr.: 2.094504589493737
Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear.: 2.2784588253289333
In a doleful voice Mrs.: 2.159327469990006
Bennet thus began the projected conversation.--"Oh!: 1.3669364725097206
Collins!"--  "My dear Madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point.: 3.2728952084034466
Far be it from me," he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter.: 2.0987194508378506
Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned.: 2.98442832050037
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.: 1.7692524150422062
Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.: 2.233205618214432
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own.: 1.8569599848041816
But we are all liable to error.: 1.9206826760964104
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.: 2.0070340227143335
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."     CHAPTER XXI.: 2.5334302508072026
The discussion of Mr.: 1.911894919470421
As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence.: 1.7480535357016378
He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.: 4.337836982089489
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs.: 1.8443598837244124
Bennet's ill humour or ill health.: 2.5141315484924336
Collins was also in the same state of angry pride.: 2.187960064633756
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.: 2.876440735033729
He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.: 2.9867192716057334
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr.: 1.991701067971347
Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.: 2.3417169070913046
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked over.--To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed.: 2.9268798292810687
"I found," said he, "as the time drew near, that I had better not meet Mr.: 2.6248421315298973
Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself."  She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her.: 2.757295679168906
His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.: 2.4802428341225307
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and was opened immediately.: 2.698964210722806
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.: 2.2939869532348656
When they had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,  "This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a good deal.: 3.190965170884599
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.: 2.9914202067712368
You shall hear what she says."  She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr.: 2.2587613521538685
Hurst had a house.: 2.909533553649294
The next was in these words.: 2.5064602246606444
"I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence.: 2.087488371805711
Bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.: 4.435716595579438
"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country.: 3.585083870609708
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?--Mr.: 1.8631061134843663
Bingley will not be detained in London by them."  "Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter.: 2.3104892948857385
I will read it to you--  "When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.: 2.727034874923436
Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I despair.: 3.8387133185435673
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of whom we shall deprive you."  "It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this winter."  "It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_."  "Why will you think so?: 2.8419022015854525
It must be his own doing.--He is his own master.: 2.942767685204845
But you do not know _all_.: 4.027908329030544
I _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me.: 2.128303190982955
Darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again.: 2.7333301872629954
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable.: 3.5498718698116134
My brother admires her greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart.: 2.6922289514273223
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?"  "What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?"--said Jane as she finished it.: 2.448123177401844
"Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard?: 2.643646498179394
Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"  "Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--Will you hear it?"  "Most willingly."  "You shall have it in few words.: 2.4963302675019245
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you."  Jane shook her head.: 2.8980421810337136
"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.--No one who has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection.: 2.7355458358720224
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot.: 3.8373202082475286
She is not such a simpleton.: 4.389536825945311
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.: 1.7227771543325456
Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.: 3.391484908032986
But the case is this.: 2.3287811439033748
We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.: 3.4485391047387433
But I know the foundation is unjust.: 2.1996339098400934
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself."  "That is right.--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine.: 2.787094558988289
A thousand things may arise in six months!"  The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt.: 1.7213253588674495
It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of every one.: 2.603490842525016
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.: 2.7474327405110652
Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.: 3.1006597136972465
They agreed that Mrs.: 1.0909462701827561
Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.: 3.1207909507984417
CHAPTER XXII.: 1.1580587750183466
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr.: 2.8741578046319085
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.: 3.0277794668132905
"It keeps him in good humour," said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express." Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.: 2.549944940607646
This was very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her from any return of Mr.: 2.1485958791806854
Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself.: 1.9594986971727724
Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.: 2.717539630534241
But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet.: 2.769594288991299
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.: 2.2900184164800392
His reception however was of the most flattering kind.: 2.2296173128107526
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.: 2.485234772295699
The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.: 2.1370203211260157
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.: 2.1660127274410366
Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair.: 2.263365786568036
Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr.: 1.7546747185185378
Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St.: 2.521913153303369
The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion.: 2.4105422762812627
The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid.: 2.2996997203227005
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed.: 0.9050161442693354
She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it.: 2.790780866047246
Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary.: 2.301452824237051
The least agreeable circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person.: 2.3566534182837238
Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation.: 2.6427130839394586
She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr.: 3.397777107852883
Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.: 2.7505733155646075
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs.: 2.3446067793043053
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.: 2.2479572860773667
"My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible."  They were all astonished; and Mr.: 3.654510947367161
Collins, "I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."  "You cannot be too much on your guard.: 2.9421024588636078
Risk any thing rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence."  "Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.: 2.5680952036883515
As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth."  With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.: 2.287093193802227
Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.: 3.02390624581356
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very agreeable companion.: 2.5699323494297293
But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away.: 2.6677036089357453
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.: 2.6749502452882585
The possibility of Mr.: 4.389620682152528
my dear Charlotte,--impossible!"  The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied,  "Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible that Mr.: 2.4807837399773294
Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"  But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.: 3.263377082084847
"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte,--"you must be surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr.: 2.2413523555691235
Collins was wishing to marry you.: 1.5616488023854431
But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done.: 4.803616202277795
I am not romantic you know.: 9.802426573874849
I never was.: 0.9936091187961706
I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr.: 1.487731405049839
Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.: 2.823303367025242
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match.: 2.6641227771154297
The strangeness of Mr.: 15.696464454462921
Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted.: 2.4744183034878473
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.: 3.20256604104998
Charlotte the wife of Mr.: 1.039332222639524
Collins, was a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.: 2.445742987181655
CHAPTER XXIII.: 1.1580587750183466
Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,  "Good Lord!: 2.2327134252161605
Sir William, how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know that Mr.: 2.9594612366638806
Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr.: 2.5097001286791976
Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.: 3.3869476312740434
In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr.: 3.8410554769224516
Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.: 3.309998943285865
Nothing could console and nothing appease her.--Nor did that day wear out her resentment.: 1.7929309680546972
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.: 2.0953535016020672
Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!: 3.428498007938314
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.: 2.3839705344669455
Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr.: 3.3031096616181013
Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.: 2.122458586128692
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs.: 2.285454131905134
Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs.: 2.5688964266803147
Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.: 2.753466685411033
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again.: 2.5793881549654185
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.: 2.4648247705698494
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.: 2.4796294074533334
Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted.: 2.229121380140865
After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.: 2.5569074088741113
Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs.: 3.1741697387767953
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband.--It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.--She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable.: 2.3906848185317147
Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs.: 1.7803250357120293
Bingley's continued absence.: 5.458247418538457
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.: 1.82539105585617
Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.: 1.9814833261665923
Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.: 2.183914823063984
Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring.: 3.913205640709172
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.: 3.1426111149729308
As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to.: 3.0271426938083343
It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.: 1.6500078441614845
Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction.: 2.349801014258703
He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company.: 2.6133680893173206
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.: 2.725702049862
The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her.: 2.6073091161055566
As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence.: 3.354794269026579
Whenever Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr.: 2.601691951751705
Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr.: 3.5886268972519844
She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.: 4.106955907902932
"Indeed, Mr.: 2.9633690465130904
Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!"  "My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.: 3.20506870424136
Let us hope for better things.: 0.97561179346808
Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor."  This was not very consoling to Mrs.: 3.162887881575928
Bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before,  "I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.: 4.915305353218648
Bennet, for any thing about the entail.: 4.364644099392289
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr.: 2.160304958929348
Collins too!--Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?"  "I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr.: 2.1281373533100147

[Illustration: A VICARAGE HOUSE.]     PRIDE AND PREJUDICE:  A Novel.: 1.310780625186708
II.: 1.2217248739793172
London: Printed for T.: 1.2260529265047773
PRIDE & PREJUDICE.: 0.6397947576185522
Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.: 3.34142464373421
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.: 2.2918516121014685
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort.: 2.9206418485224748
Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it.: 3.145051486196838
Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter.: 2.1502356658055914
Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.: 2.609700861596674
Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation.: 2.9756970465273236
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all the others.: 2.904531908939114
That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations.: 3.0287176011887276
Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself.: 3.1718174782743858
It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.: 2.909681186845082
Bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying,  "Oh!: 2.8955518452995235
that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.: 1.979411968640946
But I will not repine.: 4.705558833070001
It cannot last long.: 0.9670195104813121
He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before."  Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.: 2.8995144719582555
"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no reason.: 2.673094931305381
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all.: 3.2215993903948075
I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.: 2.5894376884518535
Thank God!: 2.4985737416012435
A little time therefore.--I shall certainly try to get the better."  With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to any one but myself."  "My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good.: 3.2317967768054627
Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you.: 3.4146593882933676
I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve."  Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection.: 2.1885381621746554
"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair.: 4.4281439038341555
_You_ wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body.: 2.668648048787796
_I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.: 1.7716538884734347
Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will.: 2.2543417503351377
You need not.: 14.953244570775258
There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well.: 2.930740026941221
The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense.: 2.5364398939316493
I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's marriage.: 2.351184177747863
It is unaccountable!: 13.46550073489548
They will ruin your happiness.: 0.9482388062415016
Consider Mr.: 0.35339026041664495
Collins's respectability, and Charlotte's prudent, steady character.: 2.4635873566768627
Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin."  "To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding, than I now do of her heart.: 2.9123288424926965
My dear Jane, Mr.: 2.488957747368663
Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him, cannot have a proper way of thinking.: 3.0288800261797273
You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger, security for happiness."  "I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied Jane, "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together.: 2.451208337889454
You alluded to something else.: 1.4966470759056005
You mentioned _two_ instances.: 0.8754136114965417
I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk.: 2.5322497473529118
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured.: 2.7229753769159473
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect.: 2.881660127548855
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us.: 2.3690386780690926
Women fancy admiration means more than it does."  "And men take care that they should."  "If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."  "I am far from attributing any part of Mr.: 3.0000807626891266
Bingley's conduct to design," said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.: 3.1882231687339617
Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business."  "And do you impute it to either of those?"  "Yes; to the last.: 3.2262960704509243
But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem.: 2.747637180486062
Stop me whilst you can."  "You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him."  "Yes, in conjunction with his friend."  "I cannot believe it.: 4.0419059511435895
Why should they try to influence him?: 1.7087788632488115
They can only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it."  "Your first position is false.: 3.0612326069337903
They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride."  "Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy," replied Jane; "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.: 2.1141860320171943
But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's.: 2.86237694731017
If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.: 2.783034544327844
By supposing such an affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy.: 1.8636811471231125
Do not distress me by the idea.: 2.1323266924272133
Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."  Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr.: 3.032195382305051
Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.: 2.93780922677075
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity.: 2.12401550395118
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.: 2.7172894348674648
Bennet's best comfort was, that Mr.: 2.9088827779905713
Bingley must be down again in the summer.: 2.311844965330659
Bennet treated the matter differently.: 3.1231469666087395
"So, Lizzy," said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love I find.: 3.320014128193549
I congratulate her.: 0.9754286814226619
Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.: 2.0303105651196502
It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions.: 2.5132699101676312
You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane.: 2.7784240792896737
Now is your time.: 2.7438843754890825
Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.: 1.8029012874570283
Let Wickham be _your_ man.: 1.1314466137886343
We must not all expect Jane's good fortune."  "True," said Mr.: 3.3838329425389415
Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it."  Mr.: 3.391826375675256
Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family.: 2.653759925214213
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr.: 2.6043537477620773
Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr.: 3.8863204639748496
Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter.: 2.9143347625118974
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else Mr.: 2.3245298797003136
Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.: 1.587596194431682
CHAPTER II.: 0.7980798552021955
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.: 1.4037233778096672
Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday.: 1.9389794744100017
The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.: 2.6346328605924025
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.: 2.0799442799225565
Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn.: 3.08014434749397
Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.: 2.6724682164547087
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred and agreeable.: 2.6588403565765226
Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs.: 2.406064828210687
Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.: 2.6674178618096005
Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.: 2.4127508493339964
They had frequently been staying with her in town.: 2.043814720113286
The first part of Mrs.: 1.2018074631680546
Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.: 1.9990747217824425
When this was done, she had a less active part to play.: 3.135376857074683
It became her turn to listen.: 1.732710124194521
Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.: 1.7951858333320008
They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.: 2.1536993578117927
"I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got Mr.: 3.654001956506765
Bingley, if she could.: 6.906956586517577
But, Lizzy!: 8.67349096065569
it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr.: 4.137695002165581
Collins's wife by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness.: 3.5971953729070125
He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him.: 3.204432439979086
The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever.: 3.37277141754384
They are all for what they can get.: 2.7249700492343316
I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.: 4.140703736909004
It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else.: 3.077902821046823
However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves."  Mrs.: 2.836763515671146
"It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," said she.: 3.772741090057685
"I am sorry it went off.: 3.4068155174037464
But these things happen so often!: 1.4248161597985742
A young man, such as you describe Mr.: 3.6976331630821213
Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent."  "An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not do for _us_.: 3.198235076020293
We do not suffer by _accident_.: 2.33803009196214
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love with only a few days before."  "But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.: 2.746172735491025
It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.: 2.1271592359300224
Bingley's love?"  "I never saw a more promising inclination.: 4.347836859744476
He was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.: 1.8106533892685808
Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable.: 2.798129811076168
At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.: 2.5095608145486854
Could there be finer symptoms?: 1.6877727859052338
Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"  "Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.: 2.662313669629725
I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately.: 3.494270246924422
It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.: 2.5213105273812677
But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us?: 3.2698191212234877
Change of scene might be of service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as anything."  Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.: 2.380163814242857
"I hope," added Mrs.: 3.003760162094669
Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her.: 3.045082403188407
We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her."  "And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr.: 3.1282340987700303
Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London!: 2.9154920868800396
My dear aunt, how could you think of it?: 3.936659092499071
Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr.: 2.715733206934768
Bingley never stirs without him."  "So much the better.: 2.1033125667430945
I hope they will not meet at all.: 2.6669781144882054
_She_ will not be able to help calling."  "She will drop the acquaintance entirely."  But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless.: 2.656660830509329
It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions.: 3.126486377660321
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.: 3.0501217107237357
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement.: 3.6317264810176635
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner.: 2.805913378426083
When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers Mr.: 3.0141020463743167
Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs.: 2.3832451061111244
Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.: 2.520751116570091
Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.: 3.1522224261432696
To Mrs.: 0.9257745837369126
Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers.: 1.5456364135836138
About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire, to which he belonged.: 2.7739839500920267
Darcy by character perfectly well.: 1.2152048429827325
Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse.: 1.6675749527513128
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley, with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself.: 2.689444776014167
Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard Mr.: 3.5371562080221812
CHAPTER III.: 0.7980798552021955
Do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.: 1.9908055089235106
I have nothing to say against _him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better.: 4.03841163270343
You have sense, and we all expect you to use it.: 2.4590370250846134
You must not disappoint your father."  "My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."  "Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."  "Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.: 2.80451049185792
I will take care of myself, and of Mr.: 4.769411099843652
Wickham too.: 7.153365610275373
He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it."  "Elizabeth, you are not serious now."  "I beg your pardon.: 4.4101350140196605
At present I am not in love with Mr.: 5.123801252880195
Wickham; no, I certainly am not.: 2.9936041062892036
But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to me--I believe it will be better that he should not.: 2.9815194298229963
I see the imprudence of it.--Oh!: 2.6061846608755213
_that_ abominable Mr.: 0.34073877072494585
Darcy!--My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it.: 3.188842552379499
My father, however, is partial to Mr.: 4.5846062884470316
Wickham.: 14.794541451973775
In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist?: 2.803487341649554
All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry.: 5.448661928642146
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object.: 3.394171347307177
When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.: 6.0387073386244
At least, you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him."  "As I did the other day," said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_.: 3.173062934282978
But do not imagine that he is always here so often.: 3.5139592033613485
You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends.: 2.9022194359576443
But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you are satisfied."  Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented.: 2.7561283167508672
Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.: 2.360607328544773
His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she "_wished_ they might be happy." Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room.: 2.5731079587081425
As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,  "I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza."  "_That_ you certainly shall."  "And I have another favour to ask.: 2.8634571839818697
Will you come and see me?"  "We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."  "I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.: 3.1573395808481495
Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford."  Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.: 3.7800724061673
"My father and Maria are to come to me in March," added Charlotte, "and I hope you will consent to be of the party.: 3.239560883921095
Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either of them."  The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual.: 2.786767789450568
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible.: 2.4391634913944253
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was.: 3.339917174060118
Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.: 2.764757116413704
She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise.: 2.1843873133515284
It was Mr.: 0.34073877072494585
Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there, to know the rest.: 2.7667825616419006
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is.: 1.4138575054002236
Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or hearing from Caroline.: 2.639385894215342
She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been lost.: 3.214407234070376
"I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London.: 4.067114112957932
I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.: 1.563156379867437
I enquired after their brother, of course.: 3.354591517242113
He was well, but so much engaged with Mr.: 3.299423422538462
Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him.: 4.071631392907201
I wish I could see her.: 3.885318154389715
My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs.: 2.001546632772358
Hurst were going out.: 1.2407674420662846
I dare say I shall soon see them here."  Elizabeth shook her head over this letter.: 2.1823803257849654
It convinced her, that accident only could discover to Mr.: 1.5661769340676275
Bingley her sister's being in town.: 3.2368515556023314
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.: 2.8843621097119594
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention.: 3.5999840218758963
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will prove what she felt.: 3.510354953913739
"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in      her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have      been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me.: 3.102206087576541
But, my      dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me      obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour      was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.: 2.269507760086117
I do not at      all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but      if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should      be deceived again.: 2.8203677323923917
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;      and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time.: 1.8612618497973368
When      she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;      she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said      not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so      altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly      resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.: 3.2296743611628713
I pity, though I      cannot help blaming her.: 2.5848852333339143
She was very wrong in singling me out as      she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on      her side.: 2.5157385917868016
But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been      acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her      brother is the cause of it.: 2.8786594300313575
I need not explain myself farther; and      though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she      feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so      deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may      feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable.: 2.4069512145067513
He knows of my      being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and      yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to      persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy.: 3.2749851897851534
I cannot      understand it.: 1.7267554899403388
If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should      be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of      duplicity in all this.: 4.516741111005849
But I will endeavour to banish every painful      thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,      and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.: 2.8570620794187276
Let me hear      from you very soon.: 2.01369491561563
Miss Bingley said something of his never      returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not      with any certainty.: 2.7303661531545074
Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria.: 3.623797631307687
I am      sure you will be very comfortable there.: 10.667546457249166
"Your's, &c."  This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.: 2.7610894345862516
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.: 1.6597891641341553
His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.: 2.6547385085796353
Darcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.: 3.6282776857619914
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself.: 2.0140766758266855
His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.: 3.135840093964584
Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.: 3.057632885943113
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.: 2.3694079823000243
The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.: 3.260754996382063
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.: 2.5220093512169233
All this was acknowledged to Mrs.: 2.2680218876407423
But my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King.: 1.626647027079919
I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl.: 3.480256483392625
There can be no love in all this.: 2.572029953420227
My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.: 3.5256127419997276
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.: 1.0258226527372256
Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.: 2.675611367285135
They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the plain."     CHAPTER IV.: 2.3158779690399456
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford.: 2.2168671046285575
There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake.: 2.940908832926757
The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay.: 3.3938333628647293
Every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch.: 4.38833143918614
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.: 3.2693649288488857
The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.: 2.555651322331784
The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.: 3.6285458499283627
The farewell between herself and Mr.: 1.1879307363536444
Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more.: 2.017587131662942
Her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable.: 2.635207779370744
Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise.: 3.1156615153548533
Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William's too long.: 3.538709659778356
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out like his information.: 1.6305782313184076
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon.: 2.714602956583969
On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.: 2.506671355206218
The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.: 3.9522411136912154
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.: 2.1182714705322434
Their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection.: 2.6377984031844397
It was reasonable, however, to hope, that they would not continue long.: 4.015176026332997
Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.: 2.6384996114393577
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.: 2.7271237490786815
"But, my dear Elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is Miss King?: 3.304975426037105
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."  "Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?: 2.3030339239501854
Where does discretion end, and avarice begin?: 2.924962309494514
Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary."  "If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think."  "She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.: 3.3861576002795934
I know no harm of her."  "But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune."  "No--why should he?: 2.7124724182041278
If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?"  "But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this event."  "A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe.: 2.622696532049941
If _she_ does not object to it, why should _we_?"  "_Her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_.: 1.755681463201514
It only shews her being deficient in something herself--sense or feeling."  "Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose.: 1.949340395612924
I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire."  "Oh!: 3.420931060367575
if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better.: 2.915558255720607
I am sick of them all.: 2.6327642521660506
Thank Heaven!: 1.1199318091118546
I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him.: 2.1389780287076654
Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all."  "Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."  Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.: 2.1215061764044076
"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs.: 1.8934662251440992
Gardiner, "but perhaps to the Lakes."  No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.: 4.052752956275425
"My dear, dear aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight!: 3.4121057326300486
You give me fresh life and vigour.: 1.7739741154305448
Adieu to disappointment and spleen.: 1.439749618581759
what hours of transport we shall spend!: 2.3188755404474546
Lakes, mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation.: 2.583137318364101
Let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."     CHAPTER V.: 1.2704979036604398
Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.: 2.6687397908034716
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side.: 1.5791147366935465
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.: 3.9220500023176315
At length the Parsonage was discernible.: 2.2532241581477233
The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every thing declared they were arriving.: 3.66486451607745
Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party.: 2.8430684500120975
In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.: 3.579114833302861
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received.: 2.6902026394739162
They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.: 2.19367999180568
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.: 3.3955589080784288
But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion.: 2.526517356894192
Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte.: 2.3194455715948936
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear.: 1.8216012741831624
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London, Mr.: 4.353171561134813
Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.: 4.017985314051394
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.: 2.5133958686759197
Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind.: 1.5438969869062344
But of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.: 2.325817849059736
It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.: 2.0022570069135353
From his garden, Mr.: 1.7140277355781333
Collins would have led them round his two meadows, but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help.: 2.4960048753679787
It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.: 1.7302305781680625
Collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.: 2.7453386788264376
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.: 2.426168687374404
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr.: 2.1627448324806435
She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over.: 2.515487485829186
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.: 1.6233750861287533
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming.: 3.065040506805217
We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home.: 2.0870522452968423
Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.: 2.158782151607335
I _should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."  "Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."  "Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.: 2.9890295090723575
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."  The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well.: 2.3397210935446053
She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr.: 1.726931831343357
Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings.: 3.1632857865507558
A lively imagination soon settled it all.: 1.3758755207842708
About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.: 2.3208525230135586
She opened the door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out,  "Oh, my dear Eliza!: 3.1370184461017123
pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen!: 2.9965943238538038
Make haste, and come down this moment."  Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.: 2.4256481006655286
"I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter!"  "La!: 2.7390264215618516
my dear," said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady Catherine.: 2.8645746742160494
The old lady is Mrs.: 0.8357456429703944
Jenkinson, who lives with them.: 2.1346733665276996
The other is Miss De Bourgh.: 2.833097826504638
Only look at her.: 2.2254885671295734
She is quite a little creature.: 2.413141496335994
Why does she not come in?"  "Oh!: 2.0332782656310173
Charlotte says, she hardly ever does.: 1.7103036436492824
It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in."  "I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.: 3.088371738666829
"She looks sickly and cross.--Yes, she will do for him very well.: 1.854801081410223
She will make him a very proper wife."  Mr.: 2.067471335558762
At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house.: 3.7409250966332657
Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.: 2.429183436100436
CHAPTER VI.: 0.6640040593848722
Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete.: 3.3678116685839754
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.: 2.6013022063675835
"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings.: 2.7445430498356074
I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen.: 2.8494001976487655
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?: 2.5283005486546655
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!"  "I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William, "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.: 2.211291698430001
About the Court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."  Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but their visit to Rosings.: 1.9967592636392508
Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.: 2.904511914001239
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,  "Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.: 2.8159227084884195
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which becomes herself and daughter.: 1.459332178791875
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion for any thing more.: 2.6291612444474763
She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved."  While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas, who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had done to his presentation at St.: 2.6548583737963543
As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park.--Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr.: 2.373714534967832
Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh.: 2.9611435304905673
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she thought she could witness without trepidation.: 2.598504631120532
From the entrance hall, of which Mr.: 2.5226914894291337
Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs.: 2.3283871261272604
In spite of having been at St.: 3.912265177465977
Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank.: 3.2195724766561584
Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.: 2.821260430100524
When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr.: 2.1643043537015942
Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment, at her being so thin, and so small.: 3.0455963992022257
There was neither in figure nor face, any likeness between the ladies.: 1.5324847581019234
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs.: 2.9222077915463096
Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.: 2.7900978593121684
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows, to admire the view, Mr.: 3.0962618945554996
The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which Mr.: 3.2514771477992532
Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater.--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.: 2.667370753647426
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them.: 1.8186174038859175
The party did not supply much conversation.: 1.366247548672008
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time.: 2.6513230122309284
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she were indisposed.: 2.1186690911464225
Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.: 3.0071275076248023
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted.: 2.852212962978143
She enquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice, as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry.: 3.538214979141678
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others.: 2.220627175383097
In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs.: 1.2054094630089804
Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs.: 2.6803896514891243
Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl.: 2.851255672061295
She asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly.--Lady Catherine then observed,  "Your father's estate is entailed on Mr.: 2.5716888732285534
Collins, I think.: 8.250911412004331
then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.: 2.5334989902691536
Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it some day.--Do your sisters play and sing?"  "One of them does."  "Why did not you all learn?--You ought all to have learned.: 1.7599580017903884
The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as your's.--Do you draw?"  "No, not at all."  "What, none of you?"  "Not one."  "That is very strange.: 2.9240870571520716
But I suppose you had no opportunity.: 3.2860982379388597
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."  "My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London."  "Has your governess left you?"  "We never had any governess."  "No governess!: 2.4912327638508676
How was that possible?: 1.6176590557597874
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess!--I never heard of such a thing.: 2.689742581269643
"Then, who taught you?: 2.941310585781715
who attended to you?: 3.1824481648011753
Without a governess you must have been neglected."  "Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn, never wanted the means.: 2.1916307346811
We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.: 2.6044357936075038
Those who chose to be idle, certainly might."  "Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one.: 2.376487693875735
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.: 1.6980306398271685
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way.: 3.2031543086202805
Four nieces of Mrs.: 1.0822137305586481
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her.: 3.093048780120504
'Lady Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"  "Yes, Ma'am, all."  "All!--What, all five out at once?: 2.6357257615278415
Very odd!--And you only the second.--The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your younger sisters must be very young?"  "Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.: 2.254362112936646
Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company.: 1.7861792964331136
But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth, as the first.: 2.5835946385985946
And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind."  "Upon my word," said her Ladyship, "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.--Pray, what is your age?"  "With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth smiling, "your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."  Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.: 2.3107273260730024
"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age."  "I am not one and twenty."  When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed.: 2.7332048354305645
Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr.: 4.8041278237073595
Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs.: 3.4908625640563686
Jenkinson to make up her party.: 1.609182992976619
Their table was superlatively stupid.: 1.4753600463231575
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs.: 1.5454844997178476
Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light.: 1.8879964675878405
A great deal more passed at the other table.: 2.724693603335681
Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.: 1.5482271322728505
Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.: 1.66810746753747
Sir William did not say much.: 2.160032083046808
He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.: 2.5581750028667356
Collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.: 2.0755766146152235
The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow.: 2.0801075041817776
From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.: 3.044059161233584
Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed.: 4.64744743833478
As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was.: 4.201497899111138
Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's praise into his own hands.: 3.3079277448983757
CHAPTER VII.: 0.6640040593848722
While Sir William was with them, Mr.: 2.7041550547606574
Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road.: 2.6270892875600915
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.: 2.85275018451549
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr.: 2.5129567908460655
Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.: 2.427056622102791
Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day.: 2.3361564440675915
Very few days passed in which Mr.: 1.898002662855212
Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours.: 3.019284015669646
Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.: 3.1041555584708562
Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.: 3.5320911977233793
Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.: 3.6974717920947153
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first.: 2.9314833376976104
Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses' reach.: 2.11317283202678
Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.: 2.5105462706180424
In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.: 1.9889213289172472
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important.: 2.843884792092936
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr.: 2.25315751070368
Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.: 2.767673479495558
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr.: 2.3332340565578753
Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence.: 2.2040146879080074
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects.: 1.504384938022986
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr.: 1.8832829477419055
Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr.: 2.6278798470495186
Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him.: 1.4302463778002736
Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,  "I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.: 2.6610677991143716
Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me."  Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.: 1.7660303343279937
Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman.: 2.188848144490148
Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs.: 2.814150983739374
Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure.: 2.4296790650961153
Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him, without saying a word.: 2.8726383819869903
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs.: 2.0241612833978784
Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.: 1.8752432258073446
At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family.: 2.489007076432767
She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added,  "My eldest sister has been in town these three months.: 3.4145392850050653
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings.: 2.9401925790786696
It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening.: 2.9564682576202728
For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter.: 2.4651937187196697
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr.: 3.0952821289531935
Darcy they had only seen at church.: 1.6548732070960641
The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room.: 2.3719537680375686
Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.: 2.7855005109951483
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs.: 2.153351926321
Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much.: 1.7867222426513536
He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr.: 2.5629461571329673
_His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out,  "What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?: 2.862918995604977
What is it you are talking of?: 2.2040626548522555
What are you telling Miss Bennet?: 10.407650655466893
"Of music!: 2.7689065492902007
It is of all subjects my delight.: 1.8662257211416535
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste.: 2.439183469959317
If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient.: 6.157672057800554
And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply.: 1.7226610457123406
I am confident that she would have performed delightfully.: 2.9034406547574565
How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"  Mr.: 1.5886880082116663
Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.: 3.1902678131963262
"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal."  "I assure you, Madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice.: 3.907372489034964
She practises very constantly."  "So much the better.: 1.2528492369620627
It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.: 3.5445232922601098
I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs.: 2.4308911021542148
Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in Mrs.: 2.9345900855552496
Jenkinson's room.: 2.701371561815479
She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house."  Mr.: 3.9354499269248593
Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made no answer.: 2.500011140539523
When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.: 3.226031540054281
Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte, stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance.: 2.1220482378548295
Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,  "You mean to frighten me, Mr.: 3.467169231399376
Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me?: 2.1295501854908827
But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.: 2.448752003303211
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others.: 2.525655137336234
My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me."  "I shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own."  Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.: 3.1890331525363713
Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear."  "I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.: 3.2512230719493913
"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried Colonel Fitzwilliam.: 2.491952793274645
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did?: 3.3285084378020553
He danced only four dances!: 1.4257417111221509
I am sorry to pain you--but so it was.: 3.053806617887103
He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.: 2.426065505943517
Darcy, you cannot deny the fact."  "I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party."  "True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room.: 2.767601264638688
Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?: 2.5737625935888775
My fingers wait your orders."  "Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers."  "Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.: 2.6038040055375107
"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?"  "I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying to him.: 2.5124539632368745
I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done."  "My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do.: 2.344506167366166
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the trouble of practising.: 3.501465373551367
It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution."  Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right.: 2.43872010504152
You have employed your time much better.: 1.3891880184292467
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think any thing wanting.: 1.920295999641024
We neither of us perform to strangers."  Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of.: 2.5334145178121674
Elizabeth immediately began playing again.: 1.0710582035616096
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy,  "Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master.: 3.9276989645764857
She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's.: 2.9643491786466445
Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."  Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.: 2.965116002057863
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.: 1.885810937608053
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home.: 2.998771071913534
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane, while Mrs.: 2.432364114430442
Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor.: 2.3506122666110274
As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr.: 2.369708930077454
Darcy, and Mr.: 4.919698594289403
Darcy only, entered the room.: 1.6223150944450841
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within.: 2.002687452792984
Darcy!: 79.50093713444149
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr.: 4.232094320983966
Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before.: 2.943394453006466
He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London."  "Perfectly so--I thank you."  She found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short pause, added,  "I think I have understood that Mr.: 3.68741426558386
Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?"  "I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future.: 2.651330983880482
He has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing."  "If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there.: 2.5386829716564754
But perhaps Mr.: 0.34073877072494585
Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle."  "I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it up, as soon as any eligible purchase offers."  Elizabeth made no answer.: 3.085511052825625
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.: 3.8713444283602922
He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable house.: 2.5155436282378485
Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.: 3.3683021650272353
Collins first came to Hunsford."  "I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object."  "Mr.: 2.8542668528121165
My friend has an excellent understanding--though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr.: 2.4947834017828954
Collins as the wisest thing she ever did.: 1.4791762151466044
She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her."  "It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends."  "An easy distance do you call it?: 3.590963356550554
It is nearly fifty miles."  "And what is fifty miles of good road?: 1.9853667802226886
Little more than half a day's journey.: 3.0171066229984707
"I should never have said Mrs.: 2.7428527386821377
Collins was settled _near_ her family."  "It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.: 3.2394600231698414
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far."  As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,  "I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family.: 2.999445318467749
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.: 1.8788155451020754
But that is not the case _here_.: 5.799228413709468
Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance."  Mr.: 1.976010055422726
Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_You_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.: 2.786474737024818
_You_ cannot have been always at Longbourn."  Elizabeth looked surprised.: 3.324241447395809
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,  "Are you pleased with Kent?"  A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from their walk.: 2.7377643947580865
The tête-à-tête surprised them.: 0.9397677202240842
Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body, went away.: 2.9426885526324997
"What can be the meaning of this!" said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone.: 3.1567975771962278
"My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way."  But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable from the time of year.: 3.2424724581084763
All field sports were over.: 1.811031890381711
Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.: 2.9483526480538385
They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt.: 2.351866407799773
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.: 2.7686073132234723
Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand.: 3.24726578593341
It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself.: 2.4774589555847446
He seldom appeared really animated.: 0.9338946959925787
Collins knew not what to make of him.: 2.482590204782048
Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself seriously to work to find it out.--She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success.: 2.960478695284687
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable.: 3.1505729731508647
It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.: 3.0709137570842597
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.: 3.062070647388965
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam.: 1.6614966673759644
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr.: 2.9742637156979352
Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.: 2.363602077472646
CHAPTER X.: 0.6640040593848722
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly meet Mr.: 1.9569518504967025
Darcy.--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a favourite haunt of hers.--How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd!--Yet it did, and even a third.: 2.385684168619444
It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.: 2.2705596934101067
He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr.: 2.4009909645877627
Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too.: 2.8162636515566177
His words seemed to imply it.: 2.175734464123147
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?: 1.6233957123912557
She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter.: 2.790287297620753
It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.: 2.6010948436661123
She was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr.: 2.3985234394932413
Are you going much farther?"  "No, I should have turned in a moment."  And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.: 2.9266706062205974
"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she.: 2.9536310963451453
"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again.: 1.9481289578033625
But I am at his disposal.: 2.8966510359314377
He arranges the business just as he pleases."  "And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice.: 2.962256106280657
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr.: 2.4471471236251667
Darcy."  "He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.: 3.338008345602908
"But so we all do.: 2.037719817210589
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.: 2.386489326152541
I speak feelingly.: 3.869276211276869
A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence."  "In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either.: 2.6886802285639604
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?"  "These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature.: 2.1301876978481573
Younger sons cannot marry where they like."  "Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do."  "Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money."  "Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son?: 2.223939196225335
Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."  He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.: 3.0587068593637143
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said,  "I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal.: 2.086368855587509
But, perhaps his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her."  "No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must divide with me.: 3.107471225379832
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy."  "Are you, indeed?: 3.3931575640813403
And pray what sort of guardians do you make?: 2.568577426577478
Does your charge give you much trouble?: 1.5387422508268733
Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way."  As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth.: 2.426720262607744
She directly replied,  "You need not be frightened.: 3.974632117268594
I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.: 3.876786344457448
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs.: 3.031893488797343
Hurst and Miss Bingley.: 5.214537190897851
I think I have heard you say that you know them."  "I know them a little.: 4.14787280920089
yes," said Elizabeth drily--"Mr.: 2.261247595515575
Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.: 1.2499103345786589
Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."  "Care of him!--Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care.: 2.4454698914860993
It was all conjecture."  "What is it you mean?"  "It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing."  "You may depend upon my not mentioning it."  "And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley.: 3.215778855304021
What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."  "Did Mr.: 2.543940818398379
Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"  "I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady."  "And what arts did he use to separate them?"  "He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam smiling.: 2.5111834470358585
"He only told me, what I have now told you."  Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation.: 3.0415925621097055
After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.: 2.7276995696233866
"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she.: 5.584479653170783
"Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings.: 2.2788746804639777
Why was he to be the judge?"  "You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"  "I do not see what right Mr.: 2.3755978793856154
Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy." "But," she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.: 3.131721358091067
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case."  "That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."  This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr.: 3.2628837292395065
Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage.: 3.123015140814743
It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.: 2.235084376077519
There could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr.: 3.2989345985675196
Darcy could have such boundless influence.: 2.416919511600861
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr.: 2.5389756207622534
Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them.: 3.4775166589174886
"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London.: 1.8372918192547967
"To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of objection.: 2.3710438760153503
All loveliness and goodness as she is!: 2.2376510859798246
Her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.: 2.2286021634448203
Neither could any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which Mr.: 2.7393354494248303
Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach." When she thought of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.: 2.2149404665290406
Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.: 2.7311713169172314
Bingley for his sister.: 6.258894538052305
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr.: 2.1679304956122936
Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.: 2.396953537578524
Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr.: 2.8479541710628755
Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home.: 2.1947243206436458
CHAPTER XI.: 0.6640040593848722
When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr.: 2.9559325196687105
Darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent.: 2.22118523210981
They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.: 1.9796392507511684
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded.: 2.862625496278019
Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings.: 3.3867148506991
She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent, without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.: 3.4850577055547722
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her.: 3.031408564479812
But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr.: 2.5601715205191033
Darcy walk into the room.: 2.051069898731069
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.: 2.332845046991328
She answered him with cold civility.: 1.9723961495927091
He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room.: 2.7414896526226205
Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.: 2.7546881681407704
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began,  "In vain have I struggled.: 2.251040839982086
My feelings will not be repressed.: 6.4649375415830885
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you."  Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.: 2.5678303923267096
She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent.: 1.983262636110141
This he considered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her, immediately followed.: 3.237113510572143
He spoke well, but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride.: 3.782981062540871
His sense of her inferiority--of its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.: 2.0156237247449083
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand.: 2.6322858102774975
As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer.: 3.5150884744900304
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said,  "In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned.: 2.7875296791181277
It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you.: 2.808198905965075
But I cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly.: 2.9168382812193543
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one.: 2.886579867866488
It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration.: 3.7498714114695044
The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation."  Mr.: 2.2247813802288583
Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise.: 2.5157465215461525
His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature.: 2.578508599773713
The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful.: 3.160984546385376
At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,  "And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!: 4.454300692401546
But it is of small importance."  "I might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?: 3.051321923456274
Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil?: 1.6731856961009404
But I have other provocations.: 3.739843420978246
You know I have.: 2.901503360811526
Had not my own feelings decided against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?"  As she pronounced these words, Mr.: 2.816658835325183
Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued.: 2.3752349664615418
"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.: 4.2164820617538865
You dare not, you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind."  She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.: 2.790108761164062
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.: 3.5766736158747876
"Can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated.: 3.176399893755495
With assumed tranquillity he then replied, "I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.: 3.274011031938696
Towards _him_ I have been kinder than towards myself."  Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.: 2.4722444309462643
Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided.: 2.511345573726482
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr.: 1.5499587624073197
Wickham.: 14.794541451973775
On this subject, what can you have to say?: 5.530158489912518
"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?"  "His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed."  "And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy.: 2.7681586957487876
"You have reduced him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty.: 1.7526183843676026
You have withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for him.: 2.418594563428589
You have done all this!: 4.007587866779626
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule."  "And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, "is your opinion of me!: 2.8871553744358223
This is the estimation in which you hold me!: 2.091862744266714
My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed!: 2.152626650742407
But perhaps," added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.: 1.95848868874931
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater policy concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by every thing.: 2.6117388327305866
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.: 1.4046966098560414
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.: 2.1554144437861176
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?: 1.9560721400885677
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?"  Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said,  "You are mistaken, Mr.: 2.2238793345639083
She went on.: 51.37639067864135
"From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."  "You have said quite enough, madam.: 3.0075855577877246
I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.: 2.7856297525420066
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great.: 4.079464501519064
She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour.: 2.207820163604325
Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it.: 2.4834145803557157
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr.: 2.302944237372835
Darcy!: 79.50093713444149
that he should have been in love with her for so many months!: 5.368177208106959
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible!: 3.161388080492395
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection.: 1.455569362558874
Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.: 2.1382418011175846
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.: 2.317755588312927
CHAPTER XII.: 0.6640040593848722
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes.: 2.9667969017195945
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise.: 2.440555625446641
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr.: 2.493304864077132
Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.: 2.954764183529237
The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.: 2.5729661805915582
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park.: 2.705196084082829
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.: 3.298775451839596
She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr.: 2.1510594160835197
Darcy, she was directly retreating.: 7.333920742876446
But the person who advanced, was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name.: 3.7652745490283204
She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr.: 2.6555933677488817
Darcy, she moved again towards the gate.: 2.06353172150046
He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.: 2.570024951937255
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"--And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.: 3.2147594298403757
With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand.--The envelope itself was likewise full.--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.: 2.1396498716554553
It was dated from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--       "Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the      apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments,      or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to      you.: 2.573689038393636
I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling      myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both,      cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation,      and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been      spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.: 3.4101280969115626
You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your      attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I      demand it of your justice.: 2.4615732806969115
"Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal      magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.: 2.6232324556205073
Wickham.--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of      my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who      had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who      had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,      to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could      be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--But      from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally      bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in      future secured, when the following account of my actions and their      motives has been read.--If, in the explanation of them which is      due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which      may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry.--The      necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--I      had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with      others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other      young woman in the country.--But it was not till the evening of the      dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a      serious attachment.--I had often seen him in love before.--At that      ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made      acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that      Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general      expectation of their marriage.: 2.8059996067524113
Your sister I also watched.--Her look and      manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any      symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the      evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with      pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of      sentiment.--If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have      been in an error.: 2.444762143360413
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make      the latter probable.--If it be so, if I have been misled by such      error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been      unreasonable.: 3.0284956695155354
But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity      of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given      the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her      temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was      desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will      venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually      influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be      indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial      conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to      the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged      to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my      own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to      my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of      repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to      an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to      forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes      must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother's      family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that      total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed      by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by      your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you.: 2.296023239385729
He had before believed her to return his      affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--But Bingley has      great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment      than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived      himself, was no very difficult point.: 2.4505387781569956
There is but one part of my conduct in the      whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is      that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to      conceal from him your sister's being in town.: 2.5093099345648624
I knew it myself, as      it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant      of it.--That they might have met without ill consequence, is      perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough      extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--Perhaps this      concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--It is done, however,      and it was done for the best.--On this subject I have nothing more      to say, no other apology to offer.: 2.795142903528883
If I have wounded your sister's      feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which      governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have      not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more      weighty accusation, of having injured Mr.: 2.6410810355453296
Wickham, I can only      refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my      family.: 2.788658692554323
Wickham is the son of a very      respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the      Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his      trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on      George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore      liberally bestowed.: 3.1100011241781416
As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think      of him in a very different manner.: 3.9605171474853313
The vicious propensities--the      want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge      of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man      of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of      seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.: 2.60253601519543
Darcy could not have.: 12.213487531906157
Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.: 2.0011654932343226
Wickham has created, a      suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his      real character.: 1.9136807816168226
It adds even another motive.: 0.970685575633225
My excellent father      died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr.: 1.9658099552061963
His own      father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these      events, Mr.: 1.6278950592253363
Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally      resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it      unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary      advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be      benefited.: 2.2138014033811153
He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,      and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would      be a very insufficient support therein.: 2.892755841802252
I knew that Mr.: 1.1344375052393347
The business was therefore soon settled.: 1.5794621606755594
He resigned all      claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could      ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three      thousand pounds.: 2.629237725506576
I      thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his      society in town.: 2.6162246251620607
In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his      studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all      restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.: 1.8470648299405985
For      about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the      incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied      to me again by letter for the presentation.: 2.530502710481414
His circumstances, he      assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were      exceedingly bad.: 3.11471306072783
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his      circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me      to others, as in his reproaches to myself.: 2.489244817208373
After this period, every      appearance of acquaintance was dropt.: 1.6999879916117469
How he lived I know not.: 2.474104731373002
I      must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget      myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce      me to unfold to any human being.: 2.462632151472961
Having said thus much, I feel no      doubt of your secrecy.: 2.6538014126208487
My sister, who is more than ten years my      junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel      Fitzwilliam, and myself.: 3.427434360478254
About a year ago, she was taken from      school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last      summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;      and thither also went Mr.: 2.550687092261474
Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by      her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,      whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his      kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe      herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.: 3.0242775224849674
She was then but      fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her      imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to      herself.: 2.887861497963376
You may imagine what I felt      and how I acted.: 2.549448225881977
Regard for my sister's credit and feelings      prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr.: 2.4243803048423076
Wickham, who left      the place immediately, and Mrs.: 2.5670678351071476
Younge was of course removed from      her charge.: 2.727477266789988
Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my      sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot      help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a      strong inducement.: 3.6842309936851865
His revenge would have been complete indeed.: 2.622193176199495
This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we      have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject      it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty      towards Mr.: 2.836187175761341
Wickham.: 14.794541451973775
I know not in what manner, under what form of      falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to      be wondered at.: 2.296454576876977
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing      concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and      suspicion certainly not in your inclination.: 2.2663405334517597
You may possibly      wonder why all this was not told you last night.: 2.2802627052740703
If your abhorrence of      _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented      by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may      be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find      some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course      of the morning.: 2.6259767223091397
I will only add, God bless you.: 2.021755465424453
"FITZWILLIAM DARCY."     CHAPTER XIII.: 1.3827226467655558
If Elizabeth, when Mr.: 3.4551876316852645
Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents.: 3.1405302680605485
But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.: 3.012001870994006
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.: 1.975137589610133
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.: 2.3864438369617504
With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield.: 2.3405265292512962
His belief of her sister's insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice.: 2.890209218267812
He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.: 2.793774992477483
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.: 2.2268831927228767
Wickham, when she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.: 2.2526109520008006
She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false!: 2.1140531491111054
This cannot be!: 7.037437907874887
This must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.: 3.0080405028839574
In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.: 2.5891216236597447
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr.: 2.6307354477479175
Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words.: 2.534970594764948
So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to the will, the difference was great.: 2.1632618291281447
But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.: 2.1919818629473875
She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with little success.: 2.6543050650055005
On both sides it was only assertion.: 2.8379548799669023
Again she read on.: 2.088004375799742
But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to render Mr.: 2.155496168602879
Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.: 2.709960280547005
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr.: 1.619465460736244
She had never heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance.: 2.860414966469399
As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of enquiring.: 3.663181847709668
His countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.: 2.22679812472721
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.: 1.741764648224583
Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr.: 2.7095110868246426
Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance.: 1.3606078675605806
But no such recollection befriended her.: 2.054123163712175
She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.: 2.9650555224068134
After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read.: 1.9950762260970878
But, alas!: 0.5160150104481042
the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question.: 2.3872906745995457
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr.: 2.8030836146973193
Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration.: 3.4170070491799867
Philips's.: 15.000792988794704
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.: 1.5167653219671904
She was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before.: 1.9053007683282224
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct.: 2.815575980547336
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr.: 2.078250958823491
Darcy--that Mr.: 1.4701767033825337
She remembered also, that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr.: 2.322031486067717
Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father, would always prevent his exposing the son.: 3.085338123590753
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned!: 2.6494395652182643
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn.: 2.157136442682716
Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr.: 4.340780934545388
Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits.: 2.8800120073270867
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr.: 2.6870953992492588
Bingley, was incomprehensible.: 2.7604026475020076
"How despicably have I acted!" she cried.--"I, who have prided myself on my discernment!--I, who have valued myself on my abilities!: 2.1607122531064644
But vanity, not love, has been my folly.--Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned.: 2.492698276444506
Till this moment, I never knew myself."  From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr.: 2.344113710755333
Darcy's explanation _there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.: 3.559096664555909
Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.--How could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been.--Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane.--She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility.: 2.725345857124293
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe.: 2.5781875152360527
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.: 2.4679467891177795
It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before.: 2.549415829914568
After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.: 2.4295385370786082
She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr.: 2.065847640005292
Darcy, only for a few minutes to take leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.--Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it.: 2.6343127276723872
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object.: 2.4562716126568755
CHAPTER XIV.: 0.6640040593848722
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr.: 2.560120462504251
Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings.: 2.17727003866701
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting, that had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been.: 3.1827223994589593
"What would she have said?--how would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself.: 1.6556796337294963
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.--"I assure you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do.: 3.168874715762066
But I am particularly attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!--They were excessively sorry to go!: 2.7713451920572583
But so they always are.: 1.253036103371615
The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year.: 1.6928783427168506
Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure."  "I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it.--I must be in town next Saturday."  "Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.: 3.2404777213614615
I expected you to stay two months.: 1.864887400715639
I told Mrs.: 0.5398087495365448
Collins so before you came.: 2.410016129068885
There can be no occasion for your going so soon.: 2.4690207237156945
Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight."  "But my father cannot.--He wrote last week to hurry my return."  "Oh!: 1.7790450875388937
your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.--Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father.: 2.108399597499005
"Mrs.: 0.5676408607386636
Collins, you must send a servant with them.: 3.3698681805403568
It is highly improper.: 1.340208064782524
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go with her.--Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr.: 2.0843837736559143
Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--I am excessively attentive to all those things.: 2.4926129442247547
You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs.: 2.835981822207046
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone."  "My uncle is to send a servant for us."  "Oh!--Your uncle!--He keeps a man-servant, does he?--I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things.: 2.480156959870989
Bromley, of course.--If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to."  Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.: 2.772499222007659
Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.: 2.229197680220095
Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.: 4.241546541896954
She studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different.: 1.9324634351138446
When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.: 2.4531953584911976
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.: 2.23393737896033
In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.: 2.348127448347988
They were hopeless of remedy.: 0.8863684508421993
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement?: 2.2496068423732645
Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing.: 2.245564520822397
Anxiety on Jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr.: 2.700296987752626
His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend.: 2.4798190570146867
How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!: 2.927495656253054
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.: 2.341775717554485
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay, as they had been at first.: 3.1517611483293493
When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.: 2.335644075925703
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr.: 0.9902364177537667
Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.: 2.4538796062813866
Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it.: 2.73648684610273
The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you.: 2.2386077674280287
Our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly."  Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.: 2.5308484230096657
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_ feel the obliged.: 2.8717191754385327
Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity replied,  "It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably.: 3.039112676236337
We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.: 2.0659953314343005
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.: 1.9910029221138255
You see on what a footing we are.: 1.6789710669504427
You see how continually we are engaged there.: 1.75857448929069
In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings."  Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.: 2.972488075407514
I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so.: 5.37439141437232
Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs.: 1.9490050408027035
Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be as well to be silent.: 2.7706658169094034
Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.: 2.803090058209582
We seem to have been designed for each other."  Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.: 2.5854914091801726
Poor Charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to such society!--But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.: 2.9198741770953736
Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.: 2.1448935137695844
At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.: 2.8075709483313505
After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr.: 2.0229671772432094
Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr.: 3.929332717785812
Gardiner, though unknown.: 2.5836477940715383
He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.: 3.098296964203146
"But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here."  Elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.: 3.0226627216947537
"Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have happened!"  "A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.: 2.664008346723833
"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!--How much I shall have to tell!"  Elizabeth privately added, "And how much I shall have to conceal."  Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr.: 2.2065306995761453
Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them.: 2.454932139676688
But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.: 3.9076580448839304
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr.: 2.5326129301349147
To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister farther.: 3.3493883201925128
It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr.: 2.6679127432640426
is not this an agreeable surprise?"  "And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia; "but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there." Then shewing her purchases: "Look here, I have bought this bonnet.: 2.077194343224885
I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.: 4.5224175749028
I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better."  And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, "Oh!: 2.653883004308237
"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer!: 3.207172302153972
It would be such a delicious scheme, and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all.: 3.6228941663483365
Good Heaven!: 1.4733300970212633
Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton."  "Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down to table.: 3.0055403534411167
"What do you think?: 4.0623465390416325
It is excellent news, capital news, and about a certain person that we all like."  Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he need not stay.: 2.311357354581253
Lydia laughed, and said,  "Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.: 2.574961719546715
You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared!: 2.8844088224494184
I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say.: 2.4390983320199515
But he is an ugly fellow!: 2.621355318460199
I am glad he is gone.: 3.863703420225064
I never saw such a long chin in my life.: 4.925178792813318
Well, but now for my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?: 2.541100851169324
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King.: 3.5423562203151344
There's for you!: 3.468763811744711
She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay.: 3.204427972231319
"I am sure there is not on _his_.: 6.155317338696614
I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her.: 1.6265122872216065
Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing?"  Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal!: 2.4594092691159353
As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.: 3.558685751698853
"How nicely we are crammed in!" cried Lydia.: 3.0305123601284163
"I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox!: 2.83946433490259
And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all, since you went away.: 2.963676027898867
Have you seen any pleasant men?: 1.1609714462369152
Have you had any flirting?: 2.0415963125870293
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.: 2.9603345816935627
Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.: 2.094646150007328
She is almost three and twenty!: 1.3284651676939867
Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty!: 2.3316024712770558
My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think.: 2.3942294328864295
Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it.: 2.6262667946317104
Lord!: 1.759571449836701
Dear me!: 3.7508057835629813
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's.: 2.146624012461635
Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs.: 2.545129097368641
Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs.: 2.8638471505408636
We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a lady,--only think what fun!: 1.7044789338451722
Not a soul knew of it, but Col.: 3.415471164931917
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!: 3.673537716194311
When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least.: 3.5988885256509735
Lord!: 1.759571449836701
how I laughed!: 0.9342131487342049
Forster.: 105.81641556105241
I thought I should have died.: 3.193273658568822
And _that_ made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."  With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn.: 2.380401371120525
Their reception at home was most kind.: 2.086344463101448
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr.: 2.065426981821618
Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth,  "I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."  Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs.: 2.0934806935995196
Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.: 3.319874215408261
Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!: 3.514328853961692
as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too.: 3.0030876147443393
And then when we came away it was such fun!: 2.241265645241078
I thought we never should have got into the coach.: 2.0015993805915078
I was ready to die of laughter.: 1.6922652865992702
And then we were so merry all the way home!: 2.595826832462346
we talked and laughed so loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!"  To this, Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures.: 2.239724041721554
They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds.: 2.052416615618575
But I confess they would have no charms for _me_.: 2.0889983374940684
She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.: 2.527435154275336
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.: 2.512699154208971
It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.: 5.333866579864681
There was another reason too for her opposition.: 1.607311063300838
The comfort to _her_, of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression.: 2.274359596867875
In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.: 2.5993086538627583
She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.: 2.86489621213823
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.: 3.712237291043503
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.: 2.7783895959005163
Darcy and herself.: 3.5872347900372947
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.: 2.132223885743084
She was sorry that Mr.: 1.1475160485578186
Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.: 2.1948235311521285
"His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment."  "Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.: 2.5825471278865004
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"  "Blame you!: 3.312980240859927
What a stroke was this for poor Jane!: 1.1665239559259073
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual.: 2.4095936363025903
Nor was Darcy's vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.: 2.350006384713611
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other.: 2.265994866462547
"This will not do," said Elizabeth.: 4.452896563235329
"You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing.: 2.7484638196409765
For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.: 2.6138975769223483
"I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she.: 5.001069090935987
"Wickham so very bad!: 1.705329334695365
It is almost past belief.: 1.1029733025397226
Darcy!: 79.50093713444149
dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.: 3.0557267779921338
Such a disappointment!: 0.9638023936023892
and having to relate such a thing of his sister!: 3.2202880161281797
It is really too distressing.: 1.2659583056742143
I am sure you must feel it so."  "Oh!: 3.94923159292612
no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both.: 2.089547226408335
I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.: 2.223454029653171
Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather."  "Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance!: 2.5579089948412363
such an openness and gentleness in his manner."  "There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men.: 2.229864762981527
One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it."  "I never thought Mr.: 3.944315956917064
Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do."  "And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason.: 2.8725189308169106
It is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind.: 3.2780743494110975
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty."  "Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now."  "Indeed I could not.: 2.8971444067027243
I was uncomfortable enough.: 0.929157571658704
I was very uncomfortable, I may say unhappy.: 2.7675156735191413
And with no one to speak to, of what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had!: 3.0595795753055945
how I wanted you!"  "How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr.: 1.7886647510175644
Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved."  "Certainly.: 2.767982884021974
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging.: 2.149718615742559
I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham's character."  Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, "Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.: 2.386553348301744
What is your own opinion?"  "That it ought not to be attempted.: 3.6890891722564114
Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public.: 2.1595096931121063
Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light.: 2.8752635897593
I am not equal to it.: 7.7543835933330145
Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.: 2.4247658259008067
At present I will say nothing about it."  "You are quite right.: 3.6045283878407295
To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever.: 1.4759991000610102
We must not make him desperate."  The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.: 3.042651415638146
She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either.: 2.647411839912464
But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbad the disclosure.: 3.239448142258768
She dared not relate the other half of Mr.: 1.954518251232419
Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend.: 3.350734541516206
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery.: 2.053378228586338
"And then," said she, "if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.: 2.545491836536205
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"  She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits.: 2.5143890842990113
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley.: 1.543118972347605
Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity.: 2.7293172750391688
"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs.: 3.6059532545218973
Bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of Jane's?: 3.5674890922835027
For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody.: 2.5994996077764223
I told my sister Philips so the other day.: 2.492262441439206
But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London.: 3.367044907515491
Well, he is a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now.: 3.321972054693616
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every body too, who is likely to know."  "I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more."  "Oh, well!: 3.7667441865725975
it is just as he chooses.: 4.614509325479368
Nobody wants him to come.: 2.6982697710103287
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it.: 3.2569634237634886
Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done."  But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.: 2.820198004416219
"Well, Lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they?: 2.823548503651973
Well, well, I only hope it will last.: 3.4294174709671266
And what sort of table do they keep?: 1.6732507099515985
Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say.: 5.0800447836319
There is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping, I dare say."  "No, nothing at all."  "A great deal of good management, depend upon it.: 2.968435010257775
Yes, yes.: 3.928995351853854
_They_ will take care not to outrun their income.: 3.023832984790688
_They_ will never be distressed for money.: 1.8579626700088638
Well, much good may it do them!: 1.4091509025834328
And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead.: 2.3839601298307342
They look upon it quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens."  "It was a subject which they could not mention before me."  "No.: 3.485681856227288
It would have been strange if they had.: 3.5981995329659857
But I make no doubt, they often talk of it between themselves.: 1.995815801362558
_I_ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."     CHAPTER XVIII.: 2.0201451057441013
The first week of their return was soon gone.: 1.7255785148162117
The second began.: 0.9742054524549032
It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace.: 3.4364959682051004
The dejection was almost universal.: 1.238521301530316
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.: 1.4723926891286323
What is to become of us!: 3.068196554783536
What are we to do!" would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.: 2.3065689706951713
"How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?"  Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years ago.: 1.8872620329724208
I thought I should have broke my heart."  "I am sure I shall break _mine_," said Lydia.: 3.8054926106814406
"If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs.: 1.2515506645153793
"Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton!: 2.1274611218962476
But papa is so disagreeable."  "A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever."  "And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good," added Kitty.: 2.5230031056257456
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn-house.: 1.6930585493087043
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.: 2.1240541398714754
Darcy's objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.: 2.37180643691234
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs.: 1.9240554620028154
Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.: 2.906765070421729
A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.: 2.376010210319149
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs.: 2.5935014719280134
Forster, the delight of Mrs.: 2.272752588037656
Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described.: 4.012355961060842
Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.: 2.008831820188894
Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia," said she, "though I am _not_ her particular friend.: 2.8513870895821927
As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go.: 3.4580959599449588
She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs.: 3.004288889829843
Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home.: 2.8247270818771497
He heard her attentively, and then said,  "Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances."  "If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair."  "Already arisen!" repeated Mr.: 2.701570429839381
"What, has she frightened away some of your lovers?: 1.9598232405300158
But do not be cast down.: 2.804685565973186
Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly."  "Indeed you are mistaken.: 2.5298732466148293
I have no such injuries to resent.: 4.561760983268795
It is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining.: 3.1001821659507547
Excuse me--for I must speak plainly.: 2.7188938413213735
Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous.: 2.4571738933808516
A flirt too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.: 2.1671340333855698
She will follow wherever Lydia leads.: 1.1315745054855042
Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled!: 1.4405022560374754
my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?"  Mr.: 2.7464494125251986
Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,  "Do not make yourself uneasy, my love.: 2.477808990049847
Wherever you and Jane are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three very silly sisters.: 2.402321173249693
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton.: 2.0076187456809134
Let her go then.: 2.4202421352004215
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here.: 2.3986785107585575
The officers will find women better worth their notice.: 1.0953638014622065
At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life."  With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.: 3.1913806567617864
It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.: 4.1044121362816
She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.: 2.4479656340747566
She saw with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers.: 2.4018142684098502
She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown.: 4.53623886094265
She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.: 2.673719171825617
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?: 2.4935411670454917
They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.: 3.0285588485124224
Wickham for the last time.: 4.724491319151291
Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.: 1.960474527218392
Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.: 3.119654765539124
He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man, asked her how she had liked him.: 2.614459734607819
Her answer was warmly in his favour.: 1.8524447222556222
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, "How long did you say that he was at Rosings?"  "Nearly three weeks."  "And you saw him frequently?"  "Yes, almost every day."  "His manners are very different from his cousin's."  "Yes, very different.: 3.5884021870598266
Darcy improves on acquaintance."  "Indeed!" cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her.: 2.817572851515191
"And pray may I ask?" but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "Is it in address that he improves?: 3.2671456972112356
for I dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials."  "Oh, no!" said Elizabeth.: 3.277111600845718
"In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was."  While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.: 2.589375464041147
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added,  "When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."  Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents,  "You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr.: 2.5775162394922138
Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right.: 2.0283347596243644
His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by.: 3.2925574158681408
I only fear that the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe.: 2.996352476650048
His fear of her, has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart."  Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head.: 3.6211050011345005
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him.: 2.636028986452328
The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.: 2.3680264898984054
When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs.: 1.683954173819128
Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning.: 2.810989871841425
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.: 2.001362024977794
Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.: 2.935381093015663
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.: 3.016790129869033
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort.: 2.816583570780201
Respect, esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown.: 2.0876561630528836
But Mr.: 0.857383407621251
Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.: 1.8373450333070558
He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments.: 2.3005065772089677
This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.: 1.919291062502735
Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband.: 3.565742195236362
But she had never felt so strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.: 1.9246791889068466
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.: 2.5440595405378583
Their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp.: 2.563726131407717
Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself.: 2.6650459233787447
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment.: 2.308059879638294
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.: 3.004372212139959
"But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to wish for.: 3.90363108868855
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.: 1.6202547948855988
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized.: 2.4104748009250954
A scheme of which every part promises delight, can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation."  When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short.: 2.087453689813682
Those to her mother, contained little else, than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs.: 2.79693080173067
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn.: 1.982640843398031
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.: 2.5769427008217876
Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.: 2.320330125227684
Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire.: 2.6318447324927963
In that county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs.: 3.0516587067402017
Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.: 1.5099081653301716
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.: 3.3084787283640753
But it was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.: 2.7756290060258864
With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.: 2.688209417571668
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner.: 3.8801762801373734
"But surely," said she, "I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."  The period of expectation was now doubled.: 2.385534995744295
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival.: 2.6832579172084765
But they did pass away, and Mr.: 2.3913292365599452
Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn.: 1.9505628374036492
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.: 2.408568120997689
One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.: 1.507358653415924
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &c.: 3.039511812096138
are sufficiently known.: 0.9723244023529719
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern.: 2.2260334190417916
To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs.: 1.9124598128006371
Gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated.: 2.1500696985356123
It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.: 2.767335139656031
In talking over their route the evening before, Mrs.: 2.2488478245217123
Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.: 3.077744724252819
"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?" said her aunt.: 3.216581680053429
Wickham passed all his youth there, you know."  Elizabeth was distressed.: 3.266980583365026
She must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.: 2.103796438894133
They have some of the finest woods in the country."  Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce.: 3.0917790707773047
The possibility of meeting Mr.: 2.5239090757092577
It would be dreadful!: 12.359468659440978
She blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk.: 2.487758091941344
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer.: 2.5419025134124644
A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme.: 3.242304275730405
To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.: 9.627210008929445

Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.: 2.30497263994544
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.: 1.6053503002129208
They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.: 2.0004066618667085
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view.: 2.162205684036399
They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.: 2.288088754230255
It was a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.: 2.2104507976893686
Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely adorned.: 1.3379885528474507
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.: 2.0261868589575456
They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!: 2.733255114182336
They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned.: 2.076048551857541
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken.: 1.5569353494128486
On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.: 3.4071508361972236
The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.: 2.2632572707748717
They followed her into the dining-parlour.: 2.3177173257423607
It was a large, well-proportioned room, handsomely fitted up.: 2.774872017096117
The hill, crowned with wood, from which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.: 2.1693071849528645
Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight.: 2.8386411743726936
The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.: 2.8058173244151874
"And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress!: 4.373998103153755
With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!: 1.5904309885777914
Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--But no,"--recollecting herself,--"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them."  This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.: 2.434493083805638
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really absent, but had not courage for it.: 2.213153299289168
At length, however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.: 2.900089167478271
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture.: 2.110294501009498
She approached, and saw the likeness of Mr.: 2.1593051128720755
Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantle-piece.: 1.2718417814394272
Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.: 1.9792075593807437
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it.: 4.315437584126205
"And that," said Mrs.: 2.8063965791545145
Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, "is my master--and very like him.: 2.133807528347649
It was drawn at the same time as the other--about eight years ago."  "I have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs.: 2.3259362447468437
Gardiner, looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face.: 2.849222712351425
But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not."  Mrs.: 2.6874335559584743
Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.: 2.7200720894866692
"Does that young lady know Mr.: 0.9992919369540455
Darcy?"  Elizabeth coloured, and said--"A little."  "And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?"  "Yes, very handsome."  "I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.: 2.622489555207442
This room was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then.: 1.8805799128359015
He was very fond of them."  This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr.: 2.5197848873705433
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.: 3.039816366195043
"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mr.: 2.557589153372409
yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long.: 2.605807546688809
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him."  Mr.: 2.03210780764281
Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs.: 1.5393243572423732
Reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.: 2.3056979161169013
I do not know who is good enough for him."  Mr.: 2.999787495877177
Gardiner smiled.: 3.280190599956682
Elizabeth could not help saying, "It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so."  "I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows him," replied the other.: 4.215015285147984
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old."  This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas.: 2.476481949139542
That he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest opinion.: 5.472119664106706
Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying,  "There are very few people of whom so much can be said.: 3.0908708666754863
You are lucky in having such a master."  "Yes, Sir, I know I am.: 3.355089335960324
If I was to go through the world, I could not meet with a better.: 4.8230158056678825
But I have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the world."  Elizabeth almost stared at her.--"Can this be Mr.: 2.568266104239523
Darcy!" thought she.: 6.927875516316022
"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs.: 2.0977466865058654
"Yes, Ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just as affable to the poor."  Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.: 2.9030736623276603
Reynolds could interest her on no other point.: 1.6232471758379075
She related the subject of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain.: 5.137849591958308
Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.: 2.7058233767991333
"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever lived.: 3.9338473891232053
Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but themselves.: 1.6752763434252376
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name.: 2.8434522695348674
Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it.: 3.1990405206729724
To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men."  "In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought Elizabeth.: 2.6493059014916978
"This fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."  "Perhaps we might be deceived."  "That is not very likely; our authority was too good."  On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when last at Pemberley.: 2.986933656177355
"He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.: 4.855883358337433
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter the room.: 3.5394111085369966
"And this is always the way with him," she added.--"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment.: 2.5929599395627827
There is nothing he would not do for her."  The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were all that remained to be shewn.: 2.6863829709801244
In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.: 3.1773127505851027
In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger.: 2.5322106526289336
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.: 1.9041182688969926
At last it arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr.: 1.2884731891203058
Darcy, with such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her.: 3.8696625596582424
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.: 1.8279369727417898
Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his father's life time.: 3.5131279126408304
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance.: 2.35304441951706
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs.: 1.488200219560645
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?: 1.6943539549014999
As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--How much of good or evil must be done by him!: 2.506961745532508
Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.: 2.6147478302239118
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.: 2.3655074781163923
As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.: 2.494872711609587
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.: 3.039727579764963
Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush.: 3.121040860669618
Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr.: 1.8725446672223955
Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it.: 1.8833252000974647
Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most uncomfortable of her life.: 2.466713927812592
Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.: 2.9973823650193387
At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.: 3.2655890704277315
The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence.: 2.9768772378988455
She was overpowered by shame and vexation.: 1.0453345970473988
Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world!: 3.1141046584278347
How strange must it appear to him!: 1.7025347944772558
In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!: 1.3333074337255166
It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again!: 2.337035124412025
why did she come?: 1.8179618411752838
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?: 2.5888150619293944
Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.: 3.122557047783595
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting.: 2.0234780097379166
That he should even speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her family!: 2.8205898981603377
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.: 1.7007083106936132
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when he put his letter into her hand!: 2.442852688558475
She knew not what to think, nor how to account for it.: 3.1072776403655666
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene.: 2.786614679365073
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr.: 2.784684707314461
Darcy then was.: 1.9914606337030412
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing, she was still dear to him.: 3.9169826294145946
Perhaps he had been civil, only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was not like ease.: 2.6546705948573797
They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.: 2.126655509587022
Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.: 2.1845292349792205
With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten miles round.: 3.2202311124648464
It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.: 2.8227584189985153
They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.: 2.3123570159911386
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs.: 2.8358902687890817
Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr.: 3.0168833199426706
Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little.: 2.763236235733576
Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance.: 4.207993093498871
The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met.: 2.1605140215272955
Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them.: 2.386224094765627
For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.: 3.7460986710524824
With a glance she saw, that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed.: 3.1398864369950292
Her colour changed, and she said no more.: 2.954708403918794
Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.: 3.0223255439314576
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself.: 3.068300087076941
"What will be his surprise," thought she, "when he knows who they are!: 2.3590307491089573
He takes them now for people of fashion."  The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.: 3.023552093392606
That he was _surprised_ by the connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr.: 4.41149698522667
Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph.: 4.191946689810214
It was consoling, that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush.: 2.4835870384543153
The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr.: 2.2624491802899
Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport.: 2.5944311178045267
Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder.: 2.166705158298023
Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself.: 2.5204181542377935
Her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was she repeating, "Why is he so altered?: 2.286038562348053
From what can it proceed?: 1.8653085378971763
It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened.: 2.5274545799166668
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this.: 1.9451790301012843
It is impossible that he should still love me."  After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.: 2.9034226756493346
It originated in Mrs.: 1.058393052345797
Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's.: 2.59798891698845
Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together.: 3.8990648509269885
After a short silence, the lady first spoke.: 3.631509944227891
"They will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr.: 2.0538454238804786
Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr.: 2.0105763924742734
Bingley's name had been last mentioned between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged.: 3.006778692834466
They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought.: 2.298076428066285
Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased.: 2.7659942096359327
His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of the highest kind.: 3.9805303411322055
They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr.: 4.140373999735439
Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.: 1.9833827174355845
He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn.: 2.441482819412484
She wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject.: 3.808827490114356
At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.: 2.80304232532807
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over.: 1.5324610292207106
On Mr.: 0.8138573233208121
Gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness.: 3.0863328696320553
Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.: 2.5749742664727626
"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.: 2.787403798957575
"There _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.: 3.2260143997209245
It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention.: 3.1819740023326157
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling."  "To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as Wickham; or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good.: 3.3408478777223074
But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable?"  Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.: 3.08884444598313
"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied her uncle.: 4.920403647522555
"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds."  Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing.: 2.5178218089362776
"From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs.: 2.4819943632367845
Gardiner, "I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body, as he has done by poor Wickham.: 3.2766586627274994
He has not an ill-natured look.: 2.651113349683125
But to be sure, the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming character!: 3.3315987290174496
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.: 1.5785101514801225
But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue."  Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire.: 3.0280237315655927
In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.: 3.4495253941356565
Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of any thing else.: 3.053629932288059
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr.: 2.371709880268299
Darcy's civility, and above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.: 4.157837467486333
CHAPTER II.: 0.7980798552021955
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr.: 1.2572475114096728
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.: 1.9800106478518402
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle, driving up the street.: 2.7430532161625285
Elizabeth immediately recognising the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she expected.: 3.071362949366184
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business.: 2.5543171793218815
Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece.: 2.3168795533156423
While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing.: 2.3936354084414555
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.: 2.0851211188607452
She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.: 2.5729425671278747
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place.: 2.0639414057119327
With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.: 2.1930569552889376
Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was only exceedingly shy.: 3.91744634966185
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.: 1.7750444677024013
Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful.: 3.213692127339372
She was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.: 2.959111210293856
They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.: 3.3244306355668187
He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.: 2.9946015658133707
To Mr.: 0.9768423400212144
They had long wished to see him.: 3.541721290408743
The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention.: 2.951662339460426
The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr.: 1.492034652653647
Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love.: 2.135008747985478
Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.: 2.0148209489764737
Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.: 4.361155480274544
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.: 3.28365698716669
In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!: 2.6058560847076975
how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a like manner.: 2.232179301538995
But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane.: 3.8925093077719146
No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard.: 1.545930290652869
Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister.: 2.3001421740087133
On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.: 2.656207380673815
He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "It is above eight months.: 3.3210155935771684
We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield."  Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn.: 2.648116606900004
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr.: 3.8962088074088146
Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.: 2.4784699447162546
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible.: 2.3967406975567767
Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.: 2.216406379299925
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose to depart, Mr.: 2.2736468006354813
Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr.: 2.1527197147313886
Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country.: 3.8557886538790394
Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed.: 2.4355236035732735
Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little.: 2.836871882066526
Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.: 2.504542452079705
But she had no reason to fear Mr.: 3.6888058676101805
Gardiner's curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication.: 4.050613752338378
Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her.: 3.9998495684216984
They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.: 1.9472897084963836
Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.: 3.4709416376425652
They could not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known, would not have recognised it for Mr.: 3.3649484976432764
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight.: 1.914636200827809
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town, where the family did not visit.: 2.2644603315229186
It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.: 3.173404406967831
Darcy afterwards discharged.: 0.7763874185850395
As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out.: 3.044939479744096
She certainly did not hate him.: 1.2369623387736344
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced.: 2.4368047405976663
But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked.: 2.376158388160454
It was gratitude.--Gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.: 2.7240403052913367
He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.: 2.5497777214662274
Such a change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.: 2.8501784030317054
She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.: 2.8638184554758146
Gardiner left them soon after breakfast.: 2.9187292365746575
The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.: 2.1980544173679033
CHAPTER III.: 0.7980798552021955
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be renewed.: 2.5319793608523904
On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.: 2.0329537276920617
Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.: 2.355941891738466
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs.: 2.3879313835507725
Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London.: 4.14888719152188
Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved.: 1.96445075722262
Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.: 2.5317062685968152
By Mrs.: 0.8212728888148488
Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments.: 2.7127304350199752
It was first broken by Mrs.: 1.0271456389353693
Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.: 2.154080674942494
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention.: 3.7147952219115528
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much.: 2.776299266020443
Her own thoughts were employing her.: 2.206875810868237
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.: 2.047664192280963
She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.: 2.467926363729567
After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family.: 2.2946846180071057
She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.: 3.1059834138054714
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs.: 2.0347366099794364
There was now employment for the whole party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected them round the table.: 3.767035647163331
While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.: 2.0967114080256906
Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.: 3.668706312751277
He had been some time with Mr.: 3.55599914881723
Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning.: 3.1511162003289748
No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room.: 2.2263387119962488
Darcy were by no means over.: 2.943395605374
Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.: 3.8039413145474557
Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,  "Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?: 3.1168595000459702
They must be a great loss to _your_ family."  In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone.: 2.9135594722957396
To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own.: 2.723309920206309
He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.: 2.3036908704243
Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more.: 2.6093183931647896
Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.: 2.738120189525762
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned; and while Mr.: 1.5505828296662914
Darcy was attending them to their carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress.: 2.9206549416818643
But Georgiana would not join her.: 1.3268045891833389
Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.: 3.195718077975896
When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.: 3.0320596375114195
"How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr.: 1.8848344756469164
Darcy," she cried; "I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.: 2.8089870669404364
She is grown so brown and coarse!: 3.581923242221633
Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again."  However little Mr.: 2.3186903450980605
Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.: 1.8609369860748526
Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.: 2.056940041577643
Her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines.: 1.865840529867227
Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them.: 2.6259462757953957
They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable."  Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.: 3.4772521089643478
He was resolutely silent however; and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued,  "I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_ a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time."  "Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but _that_ was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."  He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.: 2.819607800752561
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.: 2.3947540868755524
They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every thing but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs.: 4.343301465356159
Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs.: 4.901620538377365
Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject.: 2.672117347234057
CHAPTER IV.: 0.6640040593848722
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere.: 2.4461323372928714
Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.: 2.637249408240887
The one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago.: 1.7053957408521294
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence.: 2.0548570711207947
It was to this effect:       "Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of      a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming      you--be assured that we are all well.: 2.1761168833352325
What I have to say relates to      poor Lydia.: 2.4532423318621355
To Kitty, however, it does not      seem so wholly unexpected.: 4.66959464980301
Thoughtless and indiscreet I      can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it)      marks nothing bad at heart.: 1.8444669306583503
His choice is disinterested at least,      for he must know my father can give her nothing.: 2.562281412716129
Our poor mother      is sadly grieved.: 1.3062345730527454
My father bears it better.: 1.0500608454563112
How thankful am I,      that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must      forget it ourselves.: 2.0449088730510967
They were off Saturday night about twelve, as      is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at      eight.: 1.3162481881500225
My dear Lizzy, they must      have passed within ten miles of us.: 2.9269425375682894
Colonel Forster gives us reason      to expect him here soon.: 1.428559995207945
I am afraid you will not be able to make      it out, but I hardly know what I have written."  Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.: 3.025524909922811
"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried      letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not      confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer      for being coherent.: 2.691054930466432
Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would      write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.: 3.9975211245638924
Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day      before, not many hours after the express.: 2.2129902193441855
Though Lydia's short      letter to Mrs.: 2.5447643599376315
F.: 1.047527668725766
gave them to understand that they were going to      Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief      that W.: 1.6820649875084468
never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which      was repeated to Colonel F.: 3.264331239780756
intending to trace their route.: 1.1407895185886325
He did trace them easily to      Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed      into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them      from Epsom.: 1.4005166237956848
All that is known after this is, that they were seen      to continue the London road.: 3.0069312648745585
I know not what to think.: 3.966999796275937
After making      every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F.: 1.3937143950614677
came on into      Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at      the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such      people had been seen to pass through.: 3.815495905529224
With the kindest concern he      came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner      most creditable to his heart.: 2.3092380906296412
I am sincerely grieved for him and      Mrs.: 1.452001729398473
F.: 1.047527668725766
but no one can throw any blame on them.: 2.0704591491859574
Our distress, my      dear Lizzy, is very great.: 4.123747865440229
My father and mother believe the worst,      but I cannot think so ill of him.: 3.5193744661643027
Many circumstances might make it      more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to      pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design      against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely,      can I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible.: 2.300881618843865
I grieve to      find, however, that Colonel F.: 2.8420662572490776
is not disposed to depend upon their      marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he      feared W.: 2.033386580941491
was not a man to be trusted.: 3.5227132217531865
My poor mother is really ill      and keeps her room.: 1.3790759241651305
Could she exert herself it would be better, but      this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life      saw him so affected.: 3.94011806692689
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed      their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot      wonder.: 2.690585880148391
I am not so      selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.: 5.038080040733967
Adieu.: 14.59536766359343
I      take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,      but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging      you all to come here, as soon as possible.: 3.180989399842468
I know my dear uncle and      aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have      still something more to ask of the former.: 3.2683550143395204
What      he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress      will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest      way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again      to-morrow evening.: 2.846255042635458
In such an exigence my uncle's advice and      assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately      comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness."  "Oh!: 2.9871307308558546
where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and Mr.: 3.278033288266538
Darcy appeared.: 6.48537170263789
Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.: 2.6989358834908583
I must find Mr.: 0.7332097586037255
what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a minute, but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr.: 2.5400942011573973
You are not well enough;--you cannot go yourself."  Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.: 2.5370759865907258
Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home, instantly.: 2.8170231208176166
On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, "Let me call your maid.: 3.240258395674938
Is there nothing you could take, to give you present relief?--A glass of wine;--shall I get you one?--You are very ill."  "No, I thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.: 2.2424020022083835
"There is nothing the matter with me.: 3.349302250420313
I am quite well.: 6.8226090019310375
I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn."  She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word.: 2.4875605150491884
Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence.: 2.5923181102312656
At length, she spoke again.: 6.442975016755169
"I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news.: 4.18166500952419
It cannot be concealed from any one.: 3.4870562423439204
My youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown herself into the power of--of Mr.: 1.7790374214550075
Wickham.: 14.794541451973775
_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest.: 2.5835957210212026
She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever."  Darcy was fixed in astonishment.: 2.356955411547235
"When I consider," she added, in a yet more agitated voice, "that _I_ might have prevented it!--_I_ who knew what he was.: 2.9844076483770383
Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family!: 2.6101011124060864
Had his character been known, this could not have happened.: 2.479002089592867
But it is all, all too late now."  "I am grieved, indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved--shocked.: 2.99834391774508
But is it certain, absolutely certain?"  "Oh yes!--They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland."  "And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"  "My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour.: 2.662866693205807
But nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done.: 2.4144338026528502
How are they even to be discovered?: 2.408297105527855
I have not the smallest hope.: 3.747751219952401
It is every way horrible!"  Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.: 1.704487038757791
"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--Oh!: 1.579593947512373
had I known what I ought, what I dared, to do!: 2.656005506387214
But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too much.: 2.7775502381386326
Wretched, wretched, mistake!"  Darcy made no answer.: 1.2240822077403177
He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy.: 2.5564623951450134
Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.: 1.769497794343942
Her power was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.: 1.6947138120605356
She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.: 2.9504941995516654
It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.: 2.548099735494981
But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.: 4.218913395870741
Lydia--the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern.: 2.9179967930723296
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress.--But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.: 1.9955743016520664
This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day."  "Oh, yes.: 3.1471448095617554
Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy.: 3.3561780694573016
Say that urgent business calls us home immediately.: 1.1860173391047606
Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible.--I know it cannot be long."  He readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting, look, went away.: 2.001592017074535
As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.: 2.618899459249245
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.: 2.0809564996876517
But if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment.: 2.198157384354937
Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business.: 2.069082700788044
No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation.: 3.5279381264262053
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared incomprehensible.: 2.4166768514216255
But now it was all too natural.: 3.1312162182855365
For such an attachment as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.: 2.2363332345886233
She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body.: 3.0808184688737734
Sometimes one officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion.: 2.0078584136546445
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--Oh!: 1.1667613220876838
how acutely did she now feel it.: 1.5746575719071652
Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing, by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr.: 2.0886811525581495
Gardiner could not but be deeply affected.: 2.371746201851718
Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr.: 2.5824360869591954
Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power.--Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled.: 1.984402013602099
They were to be off as soon as possible.: 5.819380074675359
"But what is to be done about Pemberley?" cried Mrs.: 2.523983016768604
_That_ is all settled."  "That is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare.: 4.238319110476816
"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth!: 2.9646104283976022
Oh, that I knew how it was!"  But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour.: 2.2860854087747406
Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure.: 2.710134038157318
An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.: 5.806634036950075
Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.: 3.0967161031262567
"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter.: 3.0077237489978663
It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best.: 2.716409239941824
Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?: 2.799769662597801
"Upon my word," said Mrs.: 1.8118168728278659
Gardiner, "I begin to be of your uncle's opinion.: 5.493532678887151
I cannot think so very ill of Wickham.: 2.9316494428547792
Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?"  "Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest.: 2.998793504336158
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable.: 1.97162190220925
But I dare not hope it.: 2.9483642488661697
Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the case?"  "In the first place," replied Mr.: 2.47675458082025
Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland."  "Oh!: 2.960652962872094
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption!: 1.6226198594288535
And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road."  "Well, then--supposing them to be in London.: 2.874203163916862
They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose.: 2.5139552956723903
It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland."  "But why all this secrecy?: 3.1304121575947925
Why any fear of detection?: 1.555445117154413
Why must their marriage be private?: 1.2551256198510727
His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her.: 2.7285686383955494
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money.: 1.815772002805075
He cannot afford it.: 0.9241918346326697
And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?: 2.44875879082016
But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.: 2.74742021077271
Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter."  "But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?"  "It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt.: 2.970592888213497
But, really, I know not what to say.: 3.7128503833350224
But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity.: 2.4179308359479657
She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater--what shall I call it?: 2.8401744582096966
susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough.: 2.131988627462358
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman."  "But you see that Jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt."  "Of whom does Jane ever think ill?: 2.787796536804709
And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them?: 2.408989716291176
We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word.: 3.693693742781979
That he is as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating."  "And do you really know all this?" cried Mrs.: 3.429130216373358
"I do, indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring.: 7.933219472047756
"I told you the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr.: 3.0875619619933414
Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him.: 2.837807533863953
From what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl.: 3.1422035915020743
Yet he knew to the contrary himself.: 1.9008442041184164
He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her."  "But does Lydia know nothing of this?: 3.55535572963319
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?"  "Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all.: 2.8338735404858073
Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr.: 3.2237998508644052
And when I returned home, the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time.: 2.1317159372839365
As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?: 2.6459626922411297
And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs.: 2.230553959028403
Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.: 2.8464276760341662
That _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.: 1.7007332621999598
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away.: 3.164057242577902
When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were.: 2.993957748470158
Every girl in, or near Meryton, was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites."         *       *       *       *       *  It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey.: 2.1941314337678026
From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.: 3.020818285302125
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.: 1.903849317695519
They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day.: 2.285525689845658
The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.: 2.55686996055434
Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.: 2.4134366481769867
Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives.: 2.3607464416187423
"Not yet," replied Jane.: 4.974065264970007
"But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope every thing will be well."  "Is my father in town?"  "Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word."  "And have you heard from him often?"  "We have heard only once.: 3.1316448928420852
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do.: 3.7466988308805282
How are you all?"  "My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken.: 2.592861440447551
She is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all.: 2.3311194097218086
She does not yet leave her dressing-room.: 2.8557955333001472
Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven!: 2.2926608136593605
are quite well."  "But you--How are you?" cried Elizabeth.: 4.669009437163082
"You look pale.: 1.6040195655084766
How much you must have gone through!"  Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr.: 3.6320786923589563
Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of the whole party.: 3.0211965346952665
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.: 2.2705607762726365
The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.: 3.1451299388037612
Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing.: 2.0696329272554417
"If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to Brighton, with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her.: 3.4226186717536105
Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight?: 2.159390968215704
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after.: 3.650507367332378
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am.: 4.079469849772947
Poor dear child!: 0.9512809056761248
And now here's Mr.: 0.7795987602972045
Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.: 3.0875458036504178
Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.: 2.288575327791665
"Do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.: 2.6461831017728517
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.: 3.687132006640527
In a few days more, we may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost.: 2.9162380294468457
As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be done."  "Oh!: 3.3441901399549074
my dear brother," replied Mrs.: 1.5939237771994479
Bennet, "that is exactly what I could most wish for.: 3.3062170993379323
And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them marry.: 2.6367749591618797
And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them, after they are married.: 2.478796860973602
Bennet from fighting.: 2.771905291181677
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,--that I am frightened out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me, such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.: 3.257548925114114
And tell my dear Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.: 2.7700796675855037
Oh, brother, how kind you are!: 1.7950775313060705
I know you will contrive it all."  But Mr.: 1.8100692195861983
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.: 2.8401142521851988
One came from her books, and the other from her toilette.: 3.091117749352332
The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty.: 3.042652768877808
As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,  "This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.: 2.639562622071881
But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other, the balm of sisterly consolation."  Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, "Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."  Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply.: 2.3363345139463343
Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.: 2.621418855419694
In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy.: 2.688787045746801
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued the subject, by saying, "But tell me all and every thing about it, which I have not already heard.: 3.0422496438839057
Give me farther particulars.: 1.2111568940081034
What did Colonel Forster say?: 1.3724950336918056
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place?: 1.9662600551524243
They must have seen them together for ever."  "Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm.: 2.439696012512289
I am so grieved for him.: 2.81795874029728
He _was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey."  "And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?: 2.379173919295167
Did he know of their intending to go off?: 1.967868596775508
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."  "And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?"  "How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains!: 2.935350038412743
My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how imprudent a match it must be.: 2.411414083045706
Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter, she had prepared her for such a step.: 3.659561349678376
Does he know his real character?"  "I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did.: 2.8060515773942485
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.: 2.5641453446163207
And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said, that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false."  "Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!"  "Perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister.: 2.7878842566901465
"But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.: 2.089703180159653
We acted with the best intentions."  "Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife?"  "He brought it with him for us to see."  Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.: 2.377676081949676
I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with      who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the      world I love, and he is an angel.: 2.9973766949120537
I should never be happy without      him, so think it no harm to be off.: 2.7218916849518093
You need not send them word at      Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the      surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia      Wickham.: 2.952204275306329
What a good joke it will be!: 3.674556145132026
I can hardly write for      laughing.: 1.9372498247270755
Pray make my excuses to Pratt, for not keeping my      engagement, and dancing with him to-night.: 1.88216591684316
I shall send for my      clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally      to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are      packed up.: 3.0781826124046194
Good bye.: 4.524772560911848
Give my love to Colonel Forster, I hope you      will drink to our good journey.: 2.756679352881951
"Your affectionate friend,       "LYDIA BENNET."  "Oh!: 2.2837947573708464
thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!" cried Elizabeth when she had finished it.: 2.763388375251721
"What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment.: 4.253877568979635
But at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.: 2.522460959307537
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy.: 3.59271490810602
My poor father!: 0.9920163060047088
how he must have felt it!"  "I never saw any one so shocked.: 3.2596203767717844
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes.: 2.461576700632793
My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!"  "Oh!: 2.7119741648422506
Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"  "I do not know.--I hope there was.--But to be guarded at such a time, is very difficult.: 3.2782133010255
But the horror of what might possibly happen, almost took from me my faculties."  "Your attendance upon her, has been too much for you.: 2.6601606127898876
You do not look well.: 4.941715827547984
that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone."  "Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.: 2.94296011268163
Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on.: 2.166836022384501
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me.: 2.6232777455765186
She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if they could be of use to us."  "She had better have stayed at home," cried Elizabeth; "perhaps she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours.: 3.2029173358346754
Assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable.: 3.190612928615816
"He meant, I believe," replied Jane, "to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could be made out from them.: 2.8011742320587847
His principal object must be, to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham.: 1.8368376160781732
It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be remarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham.: 2.6899594276681977
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach.: 2.068192494960499
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this."     CHAPTER VI.: 3.1561727663174457
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr.: 3.7092764021754805
Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.: 2.204394899798118
His family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion.: 2.5105501379943744
They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain.: 2.4812025248671707
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.: 1.8880832813083448
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr.: 3.161182243646492
Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.: 3.540373217564142
Bennet, and was a great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom.: 4.9006030459211445
Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.: 2.729003638929411
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light.: 2.5358400417512486
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.: 3.239613197398087
Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.: 3.6517026827852264
Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street.: 2.8545275050313803
That Mr.: 0.9503191407854485
Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings.: 3.592722909963368
Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.: 2.5783489969978053
He added, that Mr.: 5.268532713443234
Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and promised to write again very soon.: 3.1833430910320177
There was also a postscript to this effect.: 1.933743318162766
"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself.: 3.086942578328618
At present we have nothing to guide us.: 2.0227069508024047
Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head.: 2.991426852191536
But, on second thoughts, perhaps Lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better than any other person."  Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved.: 2.4025709670731166
She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years.: 2.5570108726867518
It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.: 3.23764052520505
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected.: 2.506378746897214
Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.: 2.639640781695657
But before they heard again from Mr.: 1.2142081560692317
Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.: 2.689104335382362
It was as follows:       "MY DEAR SIR,       "I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation      in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now      suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter      from Hertfordshire.: 2.424219646748125
Collins and      myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable      family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest      kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.: 2.8140413053319016
No      arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe      a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that      must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind.: 2.4175513998797302
The death      of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.: 3.318540112584641
And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to      suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness      of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree      of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of      yourself and Mrs.: 3.2827114722734994
Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own      disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of      such an enormity, at so early an age.: 3.4093810878025392
Howsoever that may be, you      are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined      by Mrs.: 3.7223419289174737
Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter,      to whom I have related the affair.: 2.660339630916602
Let me advise you then, my dear Sir,      to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy      child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the      fruits of her own heinous offence.: 2.6122061182838783
"I am, dear Sir, &c.: 5.353788607108013
&c."  Mr.: 3.3556913402777893
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living.: 2.8281481856291038
His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them.: 3.1997167516185887
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out, as likely to give any news of him.: 2.744478657647339
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton.: 1.6970609480853251
He owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.: 2.5842995454866875
Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family; Jane heard them with horror.: 2.5698421934056275
"A gamester!" she cried.: 9.983415618781045
"This is wholly unexpected.: 3.1344899878340935
I had not an idea of it."  Mr.: 3.677271990365152
Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.: 3.7678400333649473
Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit.: 2.535353666183818
When Mrs.: 0.6632245997698023
Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.: 2.6655082389895086
"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia!" she cried.: 3.3195814014677163
"Sure he will not leave London before he has found them.: 2.3816324939710447
Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?"  As Mrs.: 3.0809844402604667
Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr.: 3.928021079905333
The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.: 2.871639564719906
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.: 2.5877652115006895
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs.: 2.829180880703512
Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.: 2.5766053031725944
Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from Pemberley.: 2.0250606635225625
The present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware, that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better.: 2.8970155409274714
It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.: 3.052483911041035
Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure.: 3.665792433135614
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.: 2.937882651926331
It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "Say nothing of that.: 2.967619266795341
Who should suffer but myself?: 1.2309171219838424
It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it."  "You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth.: 4.927198970012223
"You may well warn me against such an evil.: 2.632933283458591
Human nature is so prone to fall into it!: 1.542125468117552
No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame.: 4.124607795512413
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.: 2.435217969464007
It will pass away soon enough."  "Do you suppose them to be in London?"  "Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"  "And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty.: 2.4983562653665765
"She is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there will probably be of some duration."  Then, after a short silence, he continued, "Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shews some greatness of mind."  They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea.: 2.877072001052167
"This is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune!: 2.3074733660919926
Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can,--or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away."  "I am not going to run away, Papa," said Kitty, fretfully; "if _I_ should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia."  "_You_ go to Brighton!--I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne for fifty pounds!: 2.669811296665993
No officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the village.: 1.8014032942896043
Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.: 2.6413470626405435
And you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner."  Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.: 2.620675944510687
"Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy.: 3.4239046420205326
If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them."     CHAPTER VII.: 2.935886054537154
Two days after Mr.: 0.9811603386949415
Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask."  "What do you mean, Hill?: 3.1048713599418223
We have heard nothing from town."  "Dear madam," cried Mrs.: 2.31331173676513
He has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter."  Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.: 2.3154364677320594
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said,  "If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the little copse."  Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.: 2.713568791840275
Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out,  "Oh, Papa, what news?: 3.176525983884285
what news?: 2.2549960629071255
have you heard from my uncle?"  "Yes, I have had a letter from him by express."  "Well, and what news does it bring?: 4.192244457952354
good or bad?"  "What is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it."  Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.: 2.686325149039599
Jane now came up.: 4.6486951569313435
"Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know myself what it is about."       "Gracechurch-street, Monday,       August 2.: 2.8064711305680725
"MY DEAR BROTHER,       "At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such      as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction.: 2.8704464582604916
Soon after      you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what      part of London they were.: 2.530006169047768
The particulars, I reserve till we meet.: 2.2496460956535858
It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them      both----"  "Then it is, as I always hoped," cried Jane; "they are married!"       Elizabeth read on; "I have seen them both.: 3.1939133619054902
They are not married,      nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are      willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on      your side, I hope it will not be long before they are.: 2.9506580995491385
All that is      required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her      equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your      children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,      moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your      life, one hundred pounds per annum.: 2.231171591570068
These are conditions, which,      considering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as      far as I thought myself privileged, for you.: 3.273325150316791
I shall send this by      express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.: 1.6538480352570817
You      will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr.: 1.7484166852021652
Wickham's      circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to      be.: 2.5014556119897384
If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act      in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will      immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper      settlement.: 2.3917666081119986
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming      to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on      my diligence and care.: 2.8673831341805545
Send back your answer as soon as you can,      and be careful to write explicitly.: 2.1170221331873513
We have judged it best, that my      niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will      approve.: 2.8930017702087762
She comes to us to-day.: 2.663958031303453
I shall write again as soon as any      thing more is determined on.: 2.351018909623657
GARDINER."  "Is it possible!" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.: 5.3224085423664835
"Can it be possible that he will marry her?"  "Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her sister.: 2.9093341002018973
my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately.: 2.7186598641789947
Consider how important every moment is, in such a case."  "Let me write for you," said Jane, "if you dislike the trouble yourself."  "I dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done."  And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.: 3.3642242769579043
"And may I ask?" said Elizabeth, "but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with."  "Complied with!: 3.1895442410936967
I am only ashamed of his asking so little."  "And they _must_ marry!: 2.453705152966438
Yet he is _such_ a man!"  "Yes, yes, they must marry.: 3.2074918574400693
There is nothing else to be done.: 7.719968622649644
But there are two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever to pay him."  "Money!: 2.5441429176939225
my uncle!" cried Jane, "what do you mean, Sir?"  "I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after I am gone."  "That is very true," said Elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me before.: 2.5761046902046
His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!: 1.4805114150547183
it must be my uncle's doings!: 4.107944715669961
Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself.: 2.7015307262469337
A small sum could not do all this."  "No," said her father, "Wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds.: 3.0917714188065504
I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship."  "Ten thousand pounds!: 3.045088214631814
Heaven forbid!: 4.568448225347949
How is half such a sum to be repaid?"  Mr.: 1.251893909133614
Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house.: 2.5089977342377847
"And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves.: 4.681431521246121
"How strange this is!: 2.1102416159438433
And for _this_ we are to be thankful.: 1.8932064015821903
Oh, Lydia!"  "I comfort myself with thinking," replied Jane, "that he certainly would not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her.: 2.918832986768803
Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced.: 2.867210693322637
He has children of his own, and may have more.: 4.289105907940196
How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?"  "If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been," said Elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr.: 2.190867866445418
Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own.: 4.620317205038491
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited.: 4.075108984977435
Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.: 1.842711136618514
By this time she is actually with them!: 2.6419517435787143
What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!"  "We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said Jane: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy.: 2.59590964564884
His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking.: 3.719066714227545
Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten."  "Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor I, nor any body, can ever forget.: 2.2644814094042163
It is useless to talk of it."  It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.: 2.771750293823949
They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to make it known to her.: 4.162161182505075
He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied,  "Just as you please."  "May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"  "Take whatever you like, and get away."  Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up stairs together.: 2.6510894016662516
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs.: 2.28375506550674
Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all.: 2.46557904979523
After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud.: 2.298358735384136
Bennet could hardly contain herself.: 1.9810463462201644
As soon as Jane had read Mr.: 4.283656587818169
Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance.: 2.74773120969101
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation.: 2.930192338160687
To know that her daughter would be married was enough.: 3.454201648331395
She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.: 2.0213640260747407
"My dear, dear Lydia!" she cried: "This is delightful indeed!--She will be married!--I shall see her again!--She will be married at sixteen!--My good, kind brother!--I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage every thing.: 2.323615494115529
How I long to see her!: 2.374702994145314
and to see dear Wickham too!: 1.9444998082982259
But the clothes, the wedding clothes!: 2.0876771970253127
I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly.: 1.9259637388807678
Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her.: 2.8139289119827384
Stay, stay, I will go myself.: 4.174477183583771
My dear, dear Lydia!--How merry we shall be together when we meet!"  Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.: 1.831023262830438
Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.: 5.872555095925826
"For we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great measure, to his kindness.: 2.616714256686397
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr.: 2.4124438875478256
Well!: 158.20734007297727
I am so happy.: 3.47943296933355
In a short time, I shall have a daughter married.: 4.393829156165446
Wickham!: 121.45209944996236
How well it sounds.: 1.5656930961138404
And she was only sixteen last June.: 3.8609490043331305
My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you write for me.: 4.391684581756273
We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."  She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her father was at leisure to be consulted.: 2.763732213553145
One day's delay she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite so obstinate as usual.: 3.160444787378056
Other schemes too came into her head.: 2.1944000016340044
"I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips.: 3.415224004437456
And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs.: 2.5061012201704167
Long.: 11.602527070972203
here comes Hill.: 0.9239663471804476
My dear Hill, have you heard the good news?: 2.621330498142374
Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding."  Mrs.: 3.3424094763009076
Hill began instantly to express her joy.: 2.0836674925943086
Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful.: 3.2079054845374526
She felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity, could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.: 2.4823767489286466
Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him.: 3.2274499636203373
He now wished it more than ever.: 2.2546117400255565
Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her.: 1.98203704478752
When first Mr.: 0.34073877072494585
This son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for.: 2.691419619198955
Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.: 2.3907780916533254
Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he would.: 3.5774337698230454
This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving.: 2.1601701412215815
Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.: 2.2361723286899284
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.: 1.5624285461313492
Bennet and the children.: 2.7389427149387116
But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter, depended on the will of the parents.: 2.371057053414902
This was one point, with regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr.: 3.2560285912577265
Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.: 3.2038298027572916
In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him.: 2.9520174433173505
He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present arrangement.: 2.719092018919202
He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her, through her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within that sum.: 2.9696991127871217
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to have as little trouble in the business as possible.: 2.717764610256434
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.: 1.6560977355635906
His letter was soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution.: 2.4305949564245575
He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any message to her.: 2.5003533878591617
The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood.: 2.44669947117871
It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy.: 1.6787733896642814
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm house.: 3.5397376907500115
But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her misery was considered certain.: 2.7001011968827635
Bennet had been down stairs, but on this happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high.: 2.8482249175421623
No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph.: 2.7070889777809706
She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.: 2.0584102578041823
"Haye-Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings would quit it, or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off!: 2.7954947061116275
I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."  Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the servants remained.: 2.9542072568783087
Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding.: 2.092200525769584
Into _one_ house in this neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance.: 2.2229150811509957
I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn."  A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr.: 2.123053482481751
Bennet was firm: it soon led to another; and Mrs.: 1.455414224663018
Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter.: 2.387048509959542
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever, on the occasion.: 2.575650200649083
Bennet could hardly comprehend it.: 1.7765188797727396
That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible.: 2.9419452933934105
She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they took place.: 2.7629120845048685
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr.: 2.9072697290766136
Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the spot.: 2.109381492977176
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much.: 2.840109398712761
Not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them.: 3.38889908158038
Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr.: 2.4801256059669194
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.: 4.373258155178336
The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this.: 3.056345303167716
She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.: 4.0303687795679135
She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it.: 2.983762434269416
She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.: 4.290347827610759
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they should meet.: 4.203698225235914
What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been gladly and gratefully received!: 3.1395838403991605
But while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.: 2.3292131047845346
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her.: 2.2005313811626745
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was.: 1.4738902024822285
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine.: 2.679582075883312
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.: 1.682645327983734
Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.: 2.0133716215259008
To Mr.: 0.9768423400212144
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr.: 3.1847723566281454
Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia.: 3.0482336845208047
"It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon      as his marriage was fixed on.: 3.887167785719633
And I think you will agree with me,      in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both      on his account and my niece's.: 2.1598884120039807
It is Mr.: 0.598372464912502
Wickham's intention to go      into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still      some who are able and willing to assist him in the army.: 2.6791956361205784
He has the      promise of an ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in      the North.: 2.3133530789606516
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of      the kingdom.: 3.436864722432425
He promises fairly, and I hope among different people,      where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be      more prudent.: 2.0983758711149156
I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of      our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the      various creditors of Mr.: 2.606162909645408
And      will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances      to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list,      according to his information.: 2.4075525503190756
They will then join his regiment,      unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from      Mrs.: 2.4204392529196084
She is well, and begs to be dutifully      remembered to you and her mother.--Your's, &c.: 4.632963252674141
"E.: 0.249624633864179
GARDINER."  Mr.: 0.7786706663012496
Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr.: 2.2481967240882086
Bennet, was not so well pleased with it.: 6.603380522253533
"She is so fond of Mrs.: 2.9019650045936345
The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----'s regiment."  His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again, before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative.: 2.26733505945195
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to the North.: 3.3788740713337746
Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn.: 3.140473799977889
Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.: 3.6159568885407802
The carriage was sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time.: 3.5767435870899575
They came.: 3.4256278896293537
The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive them.: 3.1690164960761043
Smiles decked the face of Mrs.: 2.108721849423798
Bennet, as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.: 2.2489068445220943
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room.: 3.2186401049969304
Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.: 2.3727876593255477
Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial.: 3.6301047859143525
His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips.: 2.449212079523943
The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him.: 3.099857133376976
Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless.: 2.4817234899013565
She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.: 3.1611971509545755
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.: 2.6512905029749407
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man.: 2.4138075985896976
_She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.: 2.065254206809842
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.: 2.336930921392923
Good gracious!: 1.4813562072427962
when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again!: 3.2805132694065313
though I thought it would be very good fun if I was."  Her father lifted up his eyes.: 2.631914720958058
Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "Oh!: 2.37958106836064
mamma, do the people here abouts know I am married to-day?: 2.2001461917008127
I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like any thing."  Elizabeth could bear it no longer.: 2.6771734862447074
She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour.: 2.615552010598727
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, "Ah!: 2.367360202145907
Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman."  It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment, from which she had been so wholly free at first.: 2.97002086838949
Her ease and good spirits increased.: 1.981373801287396
She longed to see Mrs.: 2.7322112982436404
Philips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs.: 2.8604740014982446
Wickham," by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married, to Mrs.: 2.5110592870838944
Hill and the two housemaids.: 4.019037077134388
I am sure my sisters must all envy me.: 2.602778215701646
I only hope they may have half my good luck.: 1.9969154407073284
They must all go to Brighton.: 2.0127642129888836
What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."  "Very true; and if I had my will, we should.: 2.8399219802951166
Must it be so?"  "Oh, lord!: 2.4429267961211623
yes;--there is nothing in that.: 3.8019849327973607
I shall like it of all things.: 2.5841284161808886
You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.: 2.3058498378557037
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all."  "I should like it beyond any thing!" said her mother.: 3.2266837742290133
"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over."  "I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands."  Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.: 2.5627149189206677
Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.: 3.1965264392009205
No one but Mrs.: 2.382724234897453
Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.: 2.925807342619028
These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.: 1.9562356611380967
Wickham's affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him.: 3.619068014603916
She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.: 2.969016242776184
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him.: 1.883381681767564
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.: 2.205164819689989
He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country.: 3.3516701871249066
One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,  "Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe.: 3.3384599025386414
You were not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it.: 4.0454092161960755
You are so strange!: 2.643635068249973
But I must tell you how it went off.: 2.303289966780307
We were married, you know, at St.: 3.0511692354527193
Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish.: 3.9980541888906007
And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock.: 2.4676072209442057
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church.: 4.319320794572069
Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss!: 6.516198336859378
I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.: 3.107788132405892
And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon.: 2.331210350003829
However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham.: 3.558612973482069
I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.: 3.608737005545614
"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them.: 3.0882316143864816
If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight.: 2.7112396013518496
Not one party, or scheme, or any thing.: 2.2889609292911013
Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr.: 2.6597224424414856
Stone.: 7.297683831796716
Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day.: 3.9893661307781834
But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.: 2.886148829996804
Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.: 1.9978280488363895
But gracious me!: 0.987696234319784
I quite forgot!: 0.8987380604676676
I ought not to have said a word about it.: 2.0504810817021273
It was to be such a secret!"  "If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the subject.: 3.3045767885737805
You may depend upon my seeking no further."  "Oh!: 1.471660478631427
certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will ask you no questions."  "Thank you," said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry."  On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.: 3.1380752965644843
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information.: 2.3610375051698997
Darcy had been at her sister's wedding.: 6.144933215335952
It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.: 1.9793034414494786
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none.: 3.075329626061869
Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.: 2.1016931560243513
She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.: 2.382958399072624
"You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time.: 2.6665249677768124
CHAPTER X.: 0.6640040593848722
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as soon as she possibly could.: 2.6502942487799706
She was no sooner in possession of it, than hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.: 3.673325961237704
"Gracechurch-street, Sept.: 2.7496557210349653
6.: 1.3192266624751354
I must confess myself      surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.: 2.1943902936797186
Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,      that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_      side.: 2.6227266142066235
If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my      impertinence.: 2.346820422296774
But if you are really innocent and      ignorant, I must be more explicit.: 3.171652804672015
On the very day of my coming      home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.: 2.7238279209982452
Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.: 3.1075892791439084
It was all      over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked      as _your's_ seems to have been.: 2.130166779706868
He came to tell Mr.: 2.7536787288615914
Gardiner that      he had found out where your sister and Mr.: 2.672252633475298
Wickham were, and that      he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia      once.: 3.1367416475710277
From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day      after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting      for them.: 2.126377279838504
The motive professed, was his conviction of its being      owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well      known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,      to love or confide in him.: 2.9914740190698135
He generously imputed the whole to his      mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath      him, to lay his private actions open to the world.: 2.118644170150356
His character      was to speak for itself.: 2.6300843485836642
He called it, therefore, his duty to step      forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on      by himself.: 2.515255046245087
If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never      disgrace him.: 2.6973030854062108
He had been some days in town, before he was able to      discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was      more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another      reason for his resolving to follow us.: 4.039962094847491
There is a lady, it seems, a      Mrs.: 2.8308446256621416
Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was      dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though      he did not say what.: 3.5559514059075985
She then took a large house in Edward-street,      and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.: 2.0262326182092627
This Mrs.: 0.39629785937023754
Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he      went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town.: 3.600791036538167
But      it was two or three days before he could get from her what he      wanted.: 3.477340373208496
She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery      and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be      found.: 4.864787934950847
Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in      London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they      would have taken up their abode with her.: 3.38312070861759
At length, however, our      kind friend procured the wished-for direction.: 1.9976512508385267
They were in ----      street.: 1.9931006879723179
He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.: 2.535774196195449
But he found Lydia      absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.: 1.514462073756232
She was sure they should be married some time or      other, and it did not much signify when.: 3.8552333672900803
Since such were her      feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a      marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he      easily learnt, had never been _his_ design.: 2.85616740885965
He confessed himself      obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,      which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the      ill-consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone.: 2.4803320288379553
He      meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future      situation, he could conjecture very little about it.: 3.3355031091395593
He must go      somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have      nothing to live on.: 4.540745806112042
Darcy asked him why he had not married your      sister at once.: 2.5503510296901215
Bennet was not imagined to be very rich,      he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation      must have been benefited by marriage.: 4.405921675808736
But he found, in reply to      this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more      effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.: 2.4788852918480004
Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof      against the temptation of immediate relief.: 2.9104318760654837
They met several times,      for there was much to be discussed.: 2.546204092252352
Wickham of course wanted more      than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.: 2.135470643150914
Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr.: 1.1846553679313094
Darcy's next step was      to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in      Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home.: 3.125590146890134
But Mr.: 0.857383407621251
Gardiner      could not be seen, and Mr.: 4.8839159965665955
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could      so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed      seeing him, till after the departure of the former.: 2.606520028815505
He did not      leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a      gentleman had called on business.: 3.701864712923897
On Saturday he came again.: 1.6799063665174503
Your      father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they      had a great deal of talk together.: 3.98423591467765
They met again on Sunday, and      then _I_ saw him too.: 2.696048963536926
It was not all settled before Monday: as soon      as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn.: 2.787218724872796
But our visitor      was very obstinate.: 1.3092161368142412
He has been accused of many      faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one.: 2.2023497654581967
They battled it      together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman      or lady concerned in it deserved.: 2.213403305370526
But at last your uncle was forced      to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,      was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,      which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your      letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an      explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give      the praise where it was due.: 2.922155891903251
But, Lizzy, this must go no farther      than yourself, or Jane at most.: 2.37676923475146
You know pretty well, I suppose,      what has been done for the young people.: 3.68524187058178
His debts are to be paid,      amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,      another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his      commission purchased.: 3.178399679084076
It was owing to him, to his      reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character      had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been      received and noticed as he was.: 3.1234990200356236
But in spite of all this      fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that      your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit      for _another interest_ in the affair.: 2.943695191378189
When all this was resolved      on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at      Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more      when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to      receive the last finish.: 3.099476976849958
I believe I have now told you every thing.: 2.4573333477765473
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I      hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.: 2.855005714141585
Lydia came to      us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house.: 3.6826570395572493
_He_ was      exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I      would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour      while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter      last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a      piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no      fresh pain.: 3.4257957966561845
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,      representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and      all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.: 2.831053043429281
If she heard me,      it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen.: 4.39512732997799
I was      sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth      and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.: 2.2112834572722115
Darcy was      punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the      wedding.: 2.5060437208319217
He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again      on Wednesday or Thursday.: 2.9442625984498143
Will you be very angry with me, my dear      Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold      enough to say before) how much I like him.: 2.753437796630696
His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but      a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his      wife may teach him.: 2.1195120112166275
I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever      mentioned your name.: 1.4746769419010701
But slyness seems the fashion.: 0.9398094286387199
Pray forgive      me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so      far, as to exclude me from P.: 4.364482887876779
I shall never be quite happy till I      have been all round the park.: 3.1149054633693285
A low phaeton, with a nice little      pair of ponies, would be the very thing.: 2.724582734624933
But I must write no more.: 2.978138602688476
The children have been wanting me this half hour.: 1.5443985242450942
Your's, very      sincerely,       "M.: 3.2208792819462473
GARDINER."  The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share.: 2.192423393970344
The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr.: 1.4389949958943427
Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!: 2.3566039071484965
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.: 2.4319026142382065
Her heart did whisper, that he had done it for her.: 3.6029141882617193
But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham.: 2.5355199058623454
Brother-in-law of Wickham!: 2.061126300669173
Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection.: 3.3494521143331095
He had to be sure done much.: 3.674136990388091
She was ashamed to think how much.: 2.1789570856884377
But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief.: 2.030446805738449
It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return.: 2.4689201213854317
They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing to him.: 3.190679159955499
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him.: 1.7845478099688696
For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.: 2.4796702596353715
She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again.: 2.5602059283852623
Darcy and herself.: 3.5872347900372947
"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said he, as he joined her.: 3.6133801983894367
"You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome."  "I should be sorry indeed, if it were.: 3.0570380986657266
_We_ were always good friends; and now we are better."  "True.: 2.6750525044491797
And so, my dear sister, I find from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley."  She replied in the affirmative.: 3.203100634004304
"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.: 3.163161768908601
And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?: 3.5753259171787213
But of course she did not mention my name to you."  "Yes, she did."  "And what did she say?"  "That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned out well.: 3.77091069991172
At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely misrepresented."  "Certainly," he replied, biting his lips.: 2.8964558607174853
I wonder what he can be doing there."  "Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said Elizabeth.: 3.042368390658166
"It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year."  "Undoubtedly.: 2.5217442578030647
I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had."  "Yes; he introduced us to his sister."  "And do you like her?"  "Very much."  "I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two.: 3.4250470117562215
When I last saw her, she was not very promising.: 3.6448598706745874
I am very glad you liked her.: 2.3583765214816585
I hope she will turn out well."  "I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."  "Did you go by the village of Kympton?"  "I do not recollect that we did."  "I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had.: 3.2206861272784217
A most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House!: 1.3171856084224982
It would have suited me in every respect."  "How should you have liked making sermons?"  "Exceedingly well.: 2.298688271762461
I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing.: 3.663240193979001
One ought not to repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me!: 4.276412601842545
The quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of happiness!: 2.527944892792892
But it was not to be.: 7.456066530179102
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?"  "I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."  "You have.: 3.2444556767719384
and it was not wholly without foundation.: 5.238966703793667
You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it."  They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,  "Come, Mr.: 3.290198657223653
Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.: 3.057896073617437
Do not let us quarrel about the past.: 2.0475409948728958
In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind."  She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.: 3.3126528289488992
CHAPTER XI.: 0.6640040593848722
Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.: 2.982526460322172
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs.: 2.621239430322509
Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.: 2.705366859439944
my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"  "Oh, lord!: 2.638461491532068
Not these two or three years perhaps."  "Write to me very often, my dear."  "As often as I can.: 2.9668920261133804
My sisters may write to _me_.: 1.2316021657319498
They will have nothing else to do."  Mr.: 2.1742200107106604
Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's.: 2.49772250729876
He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.: 3.2644737957600634
"He is as fine a fellow," said Mr.: 2.175584280725309
Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, "as ever I saw.: 4.508102574858483
He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all.: 5.250454055493987
I am prodigiously proud of him.: 1.1394250628846134
I defy even Sir William Lucas himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law."  The loss of her daughter made Mrs.: 2.0749001455594427
Bennet very dull for several days.: 2.5301055451116468
"I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends.: 2.764659518363909
One seems so forlorn without them."  "This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said Elizabeth.: 3.0084235783144195
"It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single."  "It is no such thing.: 2.319031039201832
If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."  But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news, which then began to be in circulation.: 2.5191543494824953
Bennet was quite in the fidgets.: 4.655511877142546
"Well, well, and so Mr.: 4.281870983380924
Philips first brought her the news.) "Well, so much the better.: 2.1729182466697226
He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure _I_ never want to see him again.: 4.221553272033245
But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it.: 4.826076733919291
And who knows what _may_ happen?: 1.3627019916405934
But that is nothing to us.: 5.04989671665575
You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it.: 2.2282088280642225
And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"  "You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs.: 3.2283829422856676
Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.: 3.0162770386578206
He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday.: 2.7105515619734377
She was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be killed."  Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing colour.: 3.5989046669025053
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,  "I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed.: 3.228987662027808
But don't imagine it was from any silly cause.: 1.6972730537404739
I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I _should_ be looked at.: 3.50537357931504
I do assure you, that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain.: 2.507233636218584
Not that I am afraid of _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks."  Elizabeth did not know what to make of it.: 4.469092576172782
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it.: 3.2430095361096005
"Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation!: 2.5275203261400616
They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.: 2.061216219661961
Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs.: 2.6683363108103295
You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.: 2.7694816767276658
But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again."  His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.: 2.6692088944973555
"'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he.: 1.6877185889436288
"If he wants our society, let him seek it.: 2.1909840437872954
He knows where we live.: 1.559645199075547
I will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back again."  "Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him.: 2.9598100846509596
But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined.: 2.707548462130722
We must have Mrs.: 1.1463863367140779
Long and the Gouldings soon.: 1.7018248931296256
That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him."  Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr.: 2.388502784092179
As the day of his arrival drew near,  "I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her sister.: 3.5837157674104074
"It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.: 3.8026817582962322
My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know how much I suffer from what she says.: 3.7046722406382706
Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!"  "I wish I could say any thing to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but it is wholly out of my power.: 2.8468649472158036
You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much."  Mr.: 3.06206130115995
Bingley arrived.: 2.982063219799069
Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could.: 2.928102170919415
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.: 2.575458999002761
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.: 1.2986028833884509
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr.: 2.7121519426565808
Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.: 4.291519316302213
what's his name.: 2.1652795649413275
That tall, proud man."  "Good gracious!: 1.9111246173573901
Darcy!--and so it does I vow.: 2.2104739615662945
Well, any friend of Mr.: 1.4209647164828132
Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him."  Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.: 2.500213356642928
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter.: 2.5276578911738556
Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr.: 3.552500543188002
Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr.: 3.9400253547946615
Bingley's friend, without being heard by either of them.: 3.351478411035615
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.: 2.9805177741353335
Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.: 3.437222754321428
Her astonishment at his coming--at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.: 2.696613200992449
The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken.: 2.7322633454848617
But she would not be secure.: 12.743238463109435
"Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early enough for expectation."  She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister, as the servant was approaching the door.: 2.4647807338240106
Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected.: 3.658859730804101
On the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.: 2.017151655590882
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.: 2.356545256739077
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.: 1.4095190009246918
But, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.: 3.816127020564586
It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.: 2.996320129441616
He was received by Mrs.: 1.4226836163023149
Bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.: 2.288624370130125
Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr.: 1.998712084381591
Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.: 2.8023698842181597
He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.: 3.489337058057516
There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself.: 4.591488224473424
But now several minutes elapsed, without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane, as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground.: 1.9823544611663377
She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.: 2.209834662764428
"Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said she.: 3.610512173748243
"Yet why did he come?"  She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.: 2.803877242797981
She enquired after his sister, but could do no more.: 3.9046497511812714
"It is a long time, Mr.: 4.234883979968046
Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs.: 1.6917346372207143
He readily agreed to it.: 2.897840709790571
"I began to be afraid you would never come back again.: 2.858402078959761
People _did_ say, you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true.: 3.345276814033286
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away.: 2.1550832247349425
Miss Lucas is married and settled.: 0.9742430482537442
And one of my own daughters.: 6.586540900288843
It was in the Times and the Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be.: 5.0580932432611
It was only said, 'Lately, George Wickham, Esq.: 2.514315092305054
to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.: 2.8743099374507315
It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it.: 2.953234814606471
Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes.: 1.685399589065535
How Mr.: 0.6211523791778072
Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.: 7.383236293910248
"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married," continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr.: 4.095359788168373
They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not know how long.: 2.760610734064833
His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.: 3.354948359305366
Thank Heaven!: 1.1199318091118546
he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves."  Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr.: 2.6556261784948707
Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.: 3.494679156813097
It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present.: 3.147753808762904
A few weeks, he believed.: 5.809798833828832
"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr.: 1.8442015649763073
Bingley," said her mother, "I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr.: 4.2698108533615375
Bennet's manor.: 6.839011974843843
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.: 3.0518838754573228
At that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for moments of such painful confusion.: 2.1806775599735335
"The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be in company with either of them.: 4.143567767759009
When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.: 2.69893162013319
He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty.: 3.744249564455573
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever.: 2.9056594671795897
But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.: 3.4775805344512785
When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs.: 2.5227423159359184
Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time.: 4.065424504041602
Bingley," she added, "for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned.: 3.1898655598617487
I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement."  Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern, at having been prevented by business.: 2.801042125746312
They then went away.: 1.955898432715974
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year.: 2.5882470676599616
CHAPTER XII.: 0.6640040593848722
As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more.: 2.2189508666351183
"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she, "did he come at all?"  She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.: 2.6705737059077537
"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?: 3.3586781366191567
If he no longer cares for me, why silent?: 2.5894136362354234
Teazing, teazing, man!: 1.0706298901677174
I will think no more about him."  Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.: 2.702411939287506
"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy.: 2.422459492667172
I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming.: 3.5414936459813706
I am glad he dines here on Tuesday.: 2.5025656032431827
It will then be publicly seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance."  "Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly.: 2.6326462313338648
"Oh, Jane, take care."  "My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now."  "I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever."         *       *       *       *       *  They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs.: 3.0229665715330243
Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived.: 2.9834393293309103
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two, who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time.: 4.2682225320412135
When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.: 2.860098022704116
Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself.: 2.307151728088634
On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided.: 2.4066294410966687
He placed himself by her.: 2.1083349119443686
Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.: 2.1868684980808384
He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr.: 3.3237845131544925
Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.: 3.0831504608567744
His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured.: 3.4153022071144767
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour.: 2.502152265562775
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage.: 1.9525574262939485
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner, whenever they did.: 2.6709763243507205
Her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.: 3.3227695443643013
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.: 2.4951494232097904
Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her uncivil.: 2.3863592798913067
She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.: 3.1379088122906436
"If he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "I shall give him up for ever."  The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas!: 4.066957492974864
And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,  "The men shan't come and part us, I am determined.: 3.3382950971482224
We want none of them; do we?"  Darcy had walked away to another part of the room.: 2.3155180696973874
She followed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!: 3.1938303780976773
"A man who has once been refused!: 2.3586655741529357
How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love?: 2.1610671728768587
Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?: 2.2021629502889777
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"  She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,  "Is your sister at Pemberley still?"  "Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."  "And quite alone?: 3.084188102129944
Have all her friends left her?"  "Mrs.: 2.3436522771359463
Annesley is with her.: 1.7309538322496758
The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks."  She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success.: 2.9867544575727676
He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.: 4.484569211985664
When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party.: 3.110217777482157
She now lost every expectation of pleasure.: 1.9292159806044487
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.: 3.9637022277035734
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.: 2.7525945947775066
"Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "What say you to the day?: 3.0945213643453946
The venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat a haunch.: 3.462567400636665
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas's last week; and even Mr.: 2.060424917687149
Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not.: 2.516481971623611
Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.' She did indeed.: 2.6489329786765263
I do think Mrs.: 1.7936280717421986
Long is as good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously."  Mrs.: 2.331528163084751
Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.: 3.8123991786082807
"It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth.: 4.69668091229553
"The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.: 1.853420684582397
I hope we may often meet again."  Elizabeth smiled.: 2.917150278342364
"Lizzy, you must not do so.: 5.342307494748797
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.: 2.220738776165644
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection.: 2.442877717928767
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man."  "You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment."  "How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"  "And how impossible in others!"  "But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?"  "That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.: 2.835326723043489
We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.: 2.9562686250191192
Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your confidante."     CHAPTER XIII.: 3.008179927757976
A few days after this visit, Mr.: 2.352601033628458
Bingley called again, and alone.: 3.908093289831698
His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time.: 2.2491294321339064
He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits.: 2.9237720015095836
Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.: 2.9716244258607616
"Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky."  He should be particularly happy at any time, &c.: 2.4621846821105047
&c.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.: 2.3546555765951105
"Can you come to-morrow?"  Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.: 3.293526541605579
He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them dressed.: 4.808616777486553
In ran Mrs.: 0.3696835940944126
He is come--Mr.: 1.1559653423861562
Bingley is come.--He is, indeed.: 3.1004459244013773
Make haste, make haste.: 3.9126701696527797
Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair."  "We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago."  "Oh!: 3.0836507852784636
hang Kitty!: 7.5549166569382615
what has she to do with it?: 2.752203287670053
Come be quick, be quick!: 1.730196611124466
where is your sash my dear?"  But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.: 3.25831412794003
The same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the evening.: 2.362944517538503
After tea, Mr.: 1.1595194288746833
Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument.: 2.3693505071612475
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs.: 1.5015256842935967
Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them.: 1.771990519122463
What do you keep winking at me for?: 2.245227676658924
What am I to do?"  "Nothing child, nothing.: 2.244799031054744
I did not wink at you." She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,  "Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room.: 2.684815736967837
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it.: 3.0573577188418444
In a few minutes, Mrs.: 3.390563672025215
"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother as soon as she was in the hall.: 3.421853394048037
"Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room."  Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.: 2.5751933837952623
Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.: 3.7426926967566283
Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.: 2.229491059918989
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.: 2.3981124022584384
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.: 1.9898495754397116
After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.: 3.1359075356615906
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr.: 2.054998511938409
Darcy returned within the stated time.: 1.167461035637931
Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence.: 2.8475482960303853
Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on.: 2.404437308636818
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected.: 1.7979367909378023
There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him.: 2.8754072889263957
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs.: 4.047295869224513
Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter.: 3.3176538081798643
Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.: 3.458207989150472
But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her.: 3.481912031231144
On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would have told it all.: 2.5031506883591024
_Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she thought was still worse.: 1.8501714374457292
Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.: 2.659748482299093
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.: 2.998482894004004
"'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much.: 2.389278308047001
I do not deserve it.: 6.325159594881147
why is not every body as happy?"  Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.: 1.9340688377701278
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.: 1.8428319939640954
But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said, for the present.: 4.015647976314686
"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried.: 3.5046998647868977
"I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself.: 2.514501730986424
He is gone to my father already.: 3.536402704816636
Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family!: 2.7902951766666892
how shall I bear so much happiness!"  She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.: 2.6466783163609993
Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.: 2.1178945338795927
"And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection!: 4.193153824842962
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance!: 2.905345459098741
the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"  In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.: 2.3202957354542835
"Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door.: 3.4851042064972213
"With my mother up stairs.: 2.4244033681673316
She will be down in a moment I dare say."  He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister.: 3.252229788353046
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship.: 1.8579790881541238
They shook hands with great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.: 3.463320285888214
Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.: 1.8961101177702475
Bennet could not give her consent, or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when Mr.: 2.827011605879131
Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was.: 1.6447318607636454
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter and said,  "Jane, I congratulate you.: 3.1557219243454897
"You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled.: 3.7288067873207287
Your tempers are by no means unlike.: 2.5737080642988848
You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income."  "I hope not so.: 2.7412472425134333
Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be unpardonable in _me_."  "Exceed their income!: 1.581288929212845
Bennet," cried his wife, "what are you talking of?: 2.917436042026024
Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely more." Then addressing her daughter, "Oh!: 2.468329478946985
my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy!: 5.885807349596847
I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night.: 2.045230191705541
I knew how it would be.: 3.8967136496452586
I always said it must be so, at last.: 2.821384485587636
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing!: 3.314269907150717
I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together.: 3.1931015933998825
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!"  Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.: 2.479346447556279
Jane was beyond competition her favourite child.: 1.489555635335416
At that moment, she cared for no other.: 2.875848394524936
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.: 2.2567644398221716
Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought himself obliged to accept.: 2.7552355030906224
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur.: 2.700758314204107
In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.: 3.518264350565807
"He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!: 3.412198116232455
I had not believed it possible."  "I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth.: 4.505933906866747
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.: 2.9812679652262575
But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other."  "That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever heard you utter.: 2.9816937570000777
It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard."  "Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!"  "He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty."  This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities.: 3.059525709974132
Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.: 3.424625817935926
"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried Jane.: 2.2280516556983065
Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all!: 1.8062533782789147
If I could but see _you_ as happy!: 2.163577347306557
Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness.: 2.896182301592256
No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr.: 3.305336817405392
Collins in time."  The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret.: 2.877079229406913
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs.: 1.3189213281681498
Philips, and _she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.: 2.4438568242778165
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.: 2.780791761706921
CHAPTER XIV.: 0.6640040593848722
It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.: 3.293103297813737
As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery.: 2.97570449625624
They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open, and their visitor entered.: 2.589737313034497
They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.: 2.572688331193306
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.: 3.1519302936712426
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.: 2.508363443182324
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.: 2.8709995320066297
After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,  "I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.: 4.481719822859414
"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters."  "Yes, madam," said Mrs.: 3.075553153996808
Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine.: 3.849178866878556
"She is my youngest girl but one.: 2.920394358964086
My youngest of all, is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man, who I believe will soon become a part of the family."  "You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short silence.: 2.657578029016219
"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's."  "This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west."  Mrs.: 2.991300122758009
Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then added,  "May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr.: 2.3966220083194565
Collins well."  "Yes, very well.: 4.250317110115719
I saw them the night before last."  Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.: 2.3128526684870065
But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.: 2.7590119484167075
Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,  "Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn.: 3.0244909495302994
I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company."  "Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the different walks.: 3.4524558254305107
I think she will be pleased with the hermitage."  Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest down stairs.: 3.004078755769357
As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.: 2.9565565126437128
Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it.: 3.0486108168397004
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.: 2.286573066791366
"How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in her face.: 3.232112469514652
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner:--  "You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither.: 2.9007327198234796
"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.: 4.8491231155321435
I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here."  "Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with.: 4.558220603395341
But however insincere _you_ may choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so.: 2.131547962333211
A report of a most alarming nature, reached me two days ago.: 1.7394437179746918
Though I _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you."  "If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far.: 3.135701033335059
What could your ladyship propose by it?"  "At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."  "Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth, coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence."  "If!: 2.987632782538247
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?: 2.4344555972358357
Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves?: 4.26833832742826
Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?"  "I never heard that it was."  "And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?"  "I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.: 3.235600707057098
_You_ may ask questions, which _I_ shall not choose to answer."  "This is not to be borne.: 2.45483530077272
Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied.: 3.372416370140321
Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"  "Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."  "It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason.: 2.8431473024778073
But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.: 3.3210876073363775
You may have drawn him in."  "If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it."  "Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?: 4.268257913644326
I have not been accustomed to such language as this.: 2.16095647865533
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."  "But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit."  "Let me be rightly understood.: 2.253978212357918
No, never.: 1.9884786283242097
Darcy is engaged to _my daughter_.: 2.2987538117639303
Now what have you to say?"  "Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me."  Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,  "The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.: 3.2835337945212744
From their infancy, they have been intended for each other.: 3.4331268997021023
It was the favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of her's.: 2.773095344022155
While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family!: 3.4874764648407925
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?: 2.7487001630512276
To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh?: 3.1775846369810994
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy?: 1.8081215716731132
Have you not heard me say, that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"  "Yes, and I had heard it before.: 2.368300446419682
But what is that to me?: 4.306673099850249
If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh.: 2.789441176204122
You both did as much as you could, in planning the marriage.: 3.2564391128966013
Its completion depended on others.: 1.2200610656412072
If Mr.: 0.6211523791778072
And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"  "Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.: 1.7914727553472354
You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him.: 2.13870397486817
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us."  "These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth.: 2.477283127994439
"But the wife of Mr.: 2.538031291679467
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine."  "Obstinate, headstrong girl!: 2.1817345982186005
I am ashamed of you!: 1.9159690155270532
Is nothing due to me on that score?: 5.875036852107024
"Let us sit down.: 2.865093433543214
You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it.: 2.4716787829590983
I have not been used to submit to any person's whims.: 2.868529410189517
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."  "_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on _me_."  "I will not be interrupted.: 3.4483835135544045
They are descended on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancient, though untitled families.: 4.042607749473283
Their fortune on both sides is splendid.: 1.3527745080074767
They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?: 2.7717118440433075
The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune.: 2.203907692349209
Is this to be endured!: 2.2784981166828002
But it must not, shall not be.: 3.662744290021923
If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere, in which you have been brought up."  "In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere.: 3.0916752282624844
You _are_ a gentleman's daughter.: 1.8028358726374054
But who was your mother?: 2.2088550923541903
Who are your uncles and aunts?: 1.3276745495168987
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman.: 2.4659156975294447
I shall not go away, till you have given me the assurance I require."  "And I certainly _never_ shall give it.: 2.9108358079090215
I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.: 3.109777217414611
Your ladyship wants Mr.: 0.5662434256474334
Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make _their_ marriage at all more probable?: 1.599931859017462
Supposing him to be attached to me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?: 2.4599098739469367
Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged.: 3.1832368854428132
You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.: 2.5183775765710377
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine.: 1.8022079205584352
I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject."  "Not so hasty, if you please.: 4.063163872784001
I have by no means done.: 2.59900296997722
To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add.: 2.9861910168634025
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement.: 2.2702790024609714
I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.: 3.1600923811238446
And is _such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister?: 2.3577431884390267
Heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking?: 6.083614694921025
"You have insulted me, in every possible method.: 6.392347735314995
I must beg to return to the house."  And she rose as she spoke.: 3.115763483720278
Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back.: 3.2944240290742783
Her ladyship was highly incensed.: 6.047609026060353
"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!: 4.5597400389068055
Unfeeling, selfish girl!: 0.9426317141514912
Do you not consider that a connection with you, must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"  "Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say.: 3.388762714375707
You know my sentiments."  "You are then resolved to have him?"  "I have said no such thing.: 3.450697759691138
I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."  "It is well.: 3.16757314352236
You refuse, then, to oblige me.: 2.9711183728082986
You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.: 2.2025727134543382
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."  "Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any possible claim on me, in the present instance.: 2.9762938749618164
No principle of either, would be violated by my marriage with Mr.: 3.0212984144941863
And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn."  "And this is your real opinion!: 3.2740150763945977
This is your final resolve!: 6.269193775305572
Very well.: 3.365129387474781
I shall now know how to act.: 2.4322041932742176
Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.: 3.7235383954892747
I came to try you.: 2.366351003526508
I hoped to find you reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point."  In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,  "I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.: 2.77284193578716
I send no compliments to your mother.: 2.0764988020446227
You deserve no such attention.: 1.4152037572518603
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.: 1.557268646963543
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.: 2.319665262238954
"She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."  "She is a very fine-looking woman!: 3.7380048139356115
and her calling here was prodigiously civil!: 1.1455903849030526
for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.: 3.0191493402043523
The discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.: 2.3388440398916255
Lady Catherine it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.: 2.0890750396532005
It was a rational scheme to be sure!: 5.118912668809841
but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply the idea.: 2.4332961937574775
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.: 2.3844000508545062
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked forward to as possible, at some future time.: 1.8843940379825705
In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference.: 2.8751023083947884
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce.: 2.5935184693894535
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side.: 2.612006940932577
With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.: 1.9131048869563432
If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity unblemished could make him.: 2.834660670550364
In that case he would return no more.: 1.9380069338903338
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.: 2.4710232687273677
I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy.: 2.6044051775046024
The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.: 4.061694612412705
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.: 3.876310716604711
She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.: 3.690487289578776
He then said,  "I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly.: 2.52882247891187
I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony.: 3.185801143014585
Let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest."  The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued,  "You look conscious.: 2.7259841455577614
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer.: 2.4209136120542447
and what can _he_ have to say?"  "Something very much to the purpose of course.: 2.8558409304691437
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases.: 2.560877152261728
I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point.: 2.2225953850371956
What relates to yourself, is as follows.: 2.558357424876592
"Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs.: 1.0649343772090423
Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another: of which we have been advertised by the same authority.: 2.9235935435449183
Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate, may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious personages in this land."  "Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?" "This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage.: 2.541177861404162
Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of."  "Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?: 2.841640217680349
But now it comes out."  "My motive for cautioning you, is as follows.: 2.3930256761172006
We have reason to imagine that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye."  "_Mr.: 2.5621789040851612
Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_ surprised you.: 4.73879090147245
Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related?: 2.671732872578707
Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life!: 3.371032218489748
It is admirable!"  Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile.: 2.9930273600515696
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.: 2.196177058531812
"Are you not diverted?"  "Oh!: 2.502327930677737
Pray read on."  "After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.: 2.385972084031488
I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned." "Mr.: 2.6361249584623296
Collins moreover adds," "I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally known.: 2.385890094654854
It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it.: 2.0547059187629784
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing." "_That_ is his notion of christian forgiveness!: 1.6548233257803475
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch.: 3.560721529191528
You are not going to be _Missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.: 3.622525834813756
For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?"  "Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted.: 2.7425593146647205
But it is so strange!"  "Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing.: 2.404744183936422
Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_ pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!: 2.2127737709901543
Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr.: 3.5300479579295745
Collins's correspondence for any consideration.: 3.317551745210588
Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law.: 2.695333343630305
And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report?: 2.580594502759374
Did she call to refuse her consent?"  To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it.: 2.298094390123284
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.: 3.686431459317068
Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr.: 2.2289050455760377
Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.: 2.8068602429384217
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr.: 1.7909108956058424
Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's visit.: 3.0028729168424277
Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out.: 2.361189421629927
Bennet was not in the habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five set off together.: 2.853728426320427
Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them.: 3.5383260386665314
They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy, were to entertain each other.: 2.8178215116035816
Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.: 2.0708041086913394
They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone.: 2.5386897272167572
Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said,  "Mr.: 3.561367558742464
Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's.: 3.17639714276401
I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister.: 1.8930253856232906
Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it.: 3.372971983749081
Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express."  "I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.: 3.0812192344093576
I did not think Mrs.: 4.631192519905135
Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them."  "If you _will_ thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone.: 2.829614452790171
That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny.: 2.796292987519574
But your _family_ owe me nothing.: 1.3241127404917477
Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought only of _you_."  Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.: 2.9219696526827494
If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.: 2.2887323718522
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.: 3.1903675531810936
They walked on, without knowing in what direction.: 3.0646312439844987
She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give.: 2.4277797955628353
But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.: 2.5504577476599453
"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before.: 2.742020791629315
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly."  Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_.: 2.9334132372764077
After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations."  "What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?: 3.3207536915014737
For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof.: 2.0371966869689184
It was unpardonable.: 2.9295171152087045
"The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility."  "I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.: 2.915503021892523
The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.: 3.4996656874846344
Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner.' Those were your words.: 1.9199269924868632
You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did.: 2.813734413975768
The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way, that would induce you to accept me."  "Oh!: 2.7239180872500897
do not repeat what I then said.: 1.7268436422337476
These recollections will not do at all.: 2.495212491520328
I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it."  Darcy mentioned his letter.: 3.5942791316891087
"Did it," said he, "did it _soon_ make you think better of me?: 3.0711531445277167
Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?"  She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed.: 2.341395680612929
"I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary.: 3.3904697546844713
I hope you have destroyed the letter.: 3.050290328402955
There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again.: 2.36659880174871
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me."  "The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies."  "When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit."  "The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.: 2.9275340598846853
The adieu is charity itself.: 1.4256943604332961
But think no more of the letter.: 4.65326064167184
The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten.: 2.8342269470210413
You must learn some of my philosophy.: 1.707734526416097
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure."  "I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.: 2.199712982212386
_Your_ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of ignorance.: 2.626318376753782
But with _me_, it is not so.: 4.403422018220945
Painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.: 2.4399446949952
I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.: 3.31170650344963
As a child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my temper.: 2.523399783007009
I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.: 2.5412249338961224
Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_) I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own.: 2.6949532194429033
Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth!: 2.0167056232416347
What do I not owe you!: 1.3004875579699173
You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.: 1.4946777223527596
By you, I was properly humbled.: 3.465318584004919
I came to you without a doubt of my reception.: 2.5582189708375767
You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."  "Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"  "Indeed I had.: 1.8402743777859674
What will you think of my vanity?: 3.5020950540913067
I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses."  "My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you.: 2.22909856531745
I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.: 1.6889044613682958
How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"  "Hate you!: 1.6981276420051499
I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction."  "I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at Pemberley.: 2.4697218900607725
You blamed me for coming?"  "No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."  "Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.: 2.3723555802338203
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you."  He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.: 2.38857145355766
She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.: 2.8431935279005898
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.: 3.2054107339410423
"What could become of Mr.: 1.7223758804213194
Bingley and Jane!" was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs.: 2.0678105567896137
"I must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elizabeth.: 3.2238421908024524
"Not at all.: 5.54769162874872
When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."  "That is to say, you had given your permission.: 3.6162138574210476
I guessed as much." And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case.: 4.436133057160168
"On the evening before my going to London," said he "I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.: 3.5846668425194905
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs, absurd and impertinent.: 1.9219614711133728
His surprise was great.: 1.2571325865684952
He had never had the slightest suspicion.: 2.8964248924042217
I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."  Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.: 3.4574081228237046
"Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"  "From the former.: 2.3251752274661377
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection."  "And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him."  "It did.: 3.227993762499327
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.: 0.988609322955818
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine, made every thing easy.: 2.4507019122984093
I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.: 2.6790606767461678
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.: 3.1069145571808523
He was angry.: 1.9531223375864242
But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments.: 2.643643504594776
He has heartily forgiven me now."  Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr.: 1.906072974943707
Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself.: 2.37096586566474
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it was rather too early to begin.: 3.384830901049424
In the hall they parted.: 6.52640174164953
"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and from all the others when they sat down to table.: 3.621379593505952
She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.: 2.3970743813677875
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.: 2.2008770731645506
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.: 2.4640562476714067
At night she opened her heart to Jane.: 1.6757510965757267
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.: 3.3309435178661517
"You are joking, Lizzy.: 8.25992178062597
This cannot be!--engaged to Mr.: 1.7122455478248086
Darcy!: 79.50093713444149
No, no, you shall not deceive me.: 2.4994662918344814
I know it to be impossible."  "This is a wretched beginning indeed!: 2.3548312890699994
My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.: 3.3943498936578926
Yet, indeed, I am in earnest.: 7.071743923636478
I speak nothing but the truth.: 2.188118516659319
He still loves me, and we are engaged."  Jane looked at her doubtingly.: 5.324913583580387
"Oh, Lizzy!: 3.4448961061615786
it cannot be.: 28.125803065697596
I know how much you dislike him."  "You know nothing of the matter.: 4.391463128328082
_That_ is all to be forgot.: 3.2348468749287544
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.: 3.503290333320295
But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.: 2.227557183662927
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself."  Miss Bennet still looked all amazement.: 2.227316665402475
Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth.: 3.5333278821256133
can it be really so!: 2.586417316587028
Yet now I must believe you," cried Jane.: 2.4373811940023904
"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you certain?: 3.687776937085577
forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?"  "There can be no doubt of that.: 3.3959682979278187
It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world.: 3.1421510769356544
But are you pleased, Jane?: 3.3339484505347605
Shall you like to have such a brother?"  "Very, very much.: 3.108743007318853
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight.: 1.1730851840231384
But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.: 2.5388603457293937
And do you really love him quite well enough?: 2.458578921977725
Oh, Lizzy!: 1.4860149358728776
do any thing rather than marry without affection.: 1.8399374266188602
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?"  "Oh, yes!: 2.950116561658796
You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I tell you all."  "What do you mean?"  "Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley.: 3.6549550505874175
Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay.: 3.4398353856207486
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley."  Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment.: 2.3250276386143582
When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish.: 3.2316115454322136
"Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself.: 3.9425038712723777
I always had a value for him.: 2.0397029141191494
Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me.: 2.7162123431212373
But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.: 3.8696090536904886
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton!: 2.1827013709120306
I owe all that I know of it, to another, not to you."  Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.: 3.9345376636753446
She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend.: 3.3197533891645836
But now she would no longer conceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage.: 2.3128966908358217
Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley!: 1.6025204041633785
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here?: 2.2011165733193727
I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company.: 3.591189586443242
What shall we do with him?: 2.6770118304449606
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way."  Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.: 2.926906260397519
As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, "Mr.: 2.611437535919672
Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"  "I advise Mr.: 3.0056038399858847
Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs.: 3.5198125119003674
Bennet, "to walk to Oakham Mount this morning.: 4.48379598071468
It is a nice long walk, and Mr.: 3.0720286538934243
Darcy has never seen the view."  "It may do very well for the others," replied Mr.: 2.4097114674746667
Bingley; "but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty.: 5.872171706614477
Wont it, Kitty?"  Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.: 2.344593084009066
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented.: 2.248525248795745
As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs.: 1.6922166443037314
Bennet followed her, saying,  "I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself.: 3.291518476577024
But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then.: 3.7272894534278973
So, do not put yourself to inconvenience."  During their walk, it was resolved that Mr.: 2.185471498420669
Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening.: 3.0487658886170155
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's.: 3.2199120341659704
She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.: 2.154102084903586
But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr.: 2.522552290652183
Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.: 3.3388311835785602
*       *       *       *       *  In the evening, soon after Mr.: 3.5040943316178472
Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme.: 2.514889863231224
She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr.: 3.1957587643811984
Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.: 3.966463383762521
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he wants you in the library." She was gone directly.: 2.7992031955116063
Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.: 3.449268709919968
"Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing?: 3.270723594272194
Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man?: 2.415404178541132
Have not you always hated him?"  How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate!: 1.6417850138105032
It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr.: 2.4885585254307534
"Or in other words, you are determined to have him.: 3.0404549893846022
He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.: 2.685083894074706
But will they make you happy?"  "Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my indifference?"  "None at all.: 1.9345899209028958
We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him."  "I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him.: 3.4573862840302665
He is perfectly amiable.: 3.4722661064324196
You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms."  "Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent.: 2.995683262747001
He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask.: 3.7005058272860674
I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on having him.: 2.78737306329633
But let me advise you to think better of it.: 2.9747784300778886
I know your disposition, Lizzy.: 2.110220424730469
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior.: 1.940098202842936
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage.: 1.5616737446851399
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery.: 1.112646312309578
My child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life.: 1.8540201845539597
You know not what you are about."  Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr.: 2.461243024474555
Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.: 2.675995947087466
"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to say.: 5.179460865898407
If this be the case, he deserves you.: 2.3864622239839153
Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.: 1.4592935021109112
He heard her with astonishment.: 5.798277490677594
"This is an evening of wonders, indeed!: 2.4078364822590044
Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way.: 2.0331309948697562
I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."  He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr.: 2.9740907096835603
Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."  Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure.: 2.8447831992203225
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication.: 3.0887394861981465
Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs.: 1.9700738173534857
Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them.: 3.2653230371071547
She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.: 2.24165812616043
"Good gracious!: 1.114929357432883
Lord bless me!: 0.987696234319784
only think!: 19.47290416148864
Darcy!: 79.50093713444149
And is it really true?: 1.6949522405169568
how rich and how great you will be!: 2.6183694526184387
What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have!: 2.7599227929421946
Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all.: 3.2081482542644837
I am so pleased--so happy.: 1.8507384935122972
Such a charming man!--so handsome!: 1.9317420620128092
so tall!--Oh, my dear Lizzy!: 2.791656799858325
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.: 1.7585026546055216
Dear, dear Lizzy.: 5.5558596211514155
A house in town!: 3.2133356704623113
Three daughters married!: 1.9830730817878843
Ten thousand a year!: 5.293159887166591
Oh, Lord!: 0.8284667207030223
What will become of me.: 1.749728187204787
But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.: 3.602552762904091
'Tis as good as a Lord!: 1.8477090815005703
And a special licence.: 0.6335849351672325
You must and shall be married by a special licence.: 1.6443635532566685
But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr.: 1.5688968275054223
Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow."  This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for.: 3.1330720441646127
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs.: 2.030914733530171
Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.: 2.3980334699687287
Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.: 3.010557731986897
"Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well as Jane's."     CHAPTER XVIII.: 3.372379437026324
Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.: 2.5313423816814256
"How could you begin?" said she.: 3.5354607834698304
"I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?"  "I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation.: 2.792743897951231
It is too long ago.: 2.0951572621736605
Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?"  "For the liveliness of your mind, I did."  "You may as well call it impertinence at once.: 2.214945577248066
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention.: 2.631932835800757
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone.: 1.4038100990518823
I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike _them_.: 2.422501540109595
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you.: 2.1626935236498457
There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.: 2.579335255679542
To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love."  "Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was ill at Netherfield?"  "Dearest Jane!: 2.0765298523774733
who could have done less for her?: 2.5986510443198156
But make a virtue of it by all means.: 2.0273458728405833
My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last.: 2.714001844683247
What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?: 2.3963830036367444
But I wonder how long you _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.: 2.736764328797267
_Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the subject?: 2.823945861718682
The moral will be perfectly fair.: 1.4718750867720602
Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of removing all my doubts.: 2.3241913224113113
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.: 1.9669751272089544
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's.: 2.8378135057504084
But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for?: 3.2468320042277576
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?: 1.4893239541596637
My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made."  "Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine, what is to befall her?"  "I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth.: 3.0378874161703826
But it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly."  "And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.: 3.2216671482012815
But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."  From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr.: 2.05188922549569
Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs.: 2.376765182344849
Gardiner's long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:       "I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have      done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but      to say the truth, I was too cross to write.: 2.975922055815483
You supposed more than      really existed.: 1.2919563183745872
You must write again very      soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.: 2.018644946046053
I      thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes.: 4.4835327807116325
How could I      be so silly as to wish it!: 2.941242986223187
Your idea of the ponies is delightful.: 2.13091900544929
We will go round the Park every day.: 2.209658223693344
Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one      with such justice.: 2.9368379847001855
I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I      laugh.: 1.6650245815059843
Darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can      spare from me.: 3.5416044126057655
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.: 2.749293610710957
Your's, &c."  Mr.: 2.4225294808194757
Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine, was in a different style; and still different from either, was what Mr.: 2.827418379401672
Bennet sent to Mr.: 1.398240224318653
Collins, in reply to his last.: 4.758295753157034
"DEAR SIR,       "I must trouble you once more for congratulations.: 2.468455075155445
Elizabeth will      soon be the wife of Mr.: 1.6641964273773415
Console Lady Catherine as well as      you can.: 4.5964125524563695
He has      more to give.: 4.908800354603952
"Your's sincerely, &c."  Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere.: 3.309414957819344
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard.: 2.345066441257603
Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.: 2.6855181954434535
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother's in sending it.: 1.9660630940830888
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.: 2.179529866893295
Before any answer could arrive from Mr.: 1.0001050743349402
Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge.: 3.3053952965603526
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident.: 1.918108896145581
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over.: 2.400645256144117
At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr.: 2.989183669611048
Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband.: 4.959536733359645
He bore it however with admirable calmness.: 1.919931283841054
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St.: 2.3724839338842534
James's, with very decent composure.: 4.003670789303135
If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.: 3.780452680723624
Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs.: 3.1738121370932095
Philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.: 3.2787311802434447
Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant.: 3.2900417192885225
Elizabeth did all she could, to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.: 2.7817750605070026
Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.: 1.7227801271134038
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs.: 0.81266583945618
Bingley and talked of Mrs.: 2.0496193589545353
Darcy may be guessed.: 1.7723652778490642
I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children, produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.: 2.7997285395620892
Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do.: 1.953436563169612
He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.: 2.5745080244175162
Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.: 2.2865820600127824
So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.: 2.046632584354338
The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.: 2.4080883585561517
Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters.: 2.58364176468079
In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great.: 2.2169267588098287
She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid.: 2.4947999795265297
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs.: 2.514936740084677
Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.: 2.3449871598600853
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs.: 2.1213950650914826
Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.: 3.2959984165295495
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune.: 2.6423389667235364
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.: 2.9201043696690134
The letter was to this effect:       "MY DEAR LIZZY,       "I wish you joy.: 4.037755040742662
If you love Mr.: 0.5808596569435012
Darcy half as well as I do my dear      Wickham, you must be very happy.: 3.8126519559555745
It is a great comfort to have you      so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will      think of us.: 4.51218283753127
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very      much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live      upon without some help.: 2.786167489190449
Any place would do, of about three or four      hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr.: 2.9606837842338436
Darcy about it,      if you had rather not.: 7.384445781214537
"Yours, &c."  As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.: 2.0371983972044148
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them.: 2.6173462809886403
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance towards discharging their bills.: 2.272505449404836
Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme.: 1.8939965332795958
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.: 2.305807325777471
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.: 2.1433906842577155
Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.: 2.5537602257312098
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.: 2.6548466337361862
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.: 2.5094004362591305
Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.: 2.6838062892419483
They were able to love each other, even as well as they intended.: 2.9746106953898437
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother.: 2.4553484893449835
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way.: 1.8723206687924623
By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.: 2.508368545115983
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end.: 2.609094381571922
But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.: 3.178295133627265
