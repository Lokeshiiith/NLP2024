A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air.: 1.648434370501858
He held the bowl aloft and intoned:  —_Introibo ad altare Dei_.: 2.1562978243270496
Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:  —Come up, Kinch!: 1.9957416570608153
Come up, you fearful jesuit!: 1.7447028887141942
Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest.: 1.7949924978730813
He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains.: 1.5458055749426742
Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.: 2.056095794285142
Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly.: 1.836371706168535
—Back to barracks!: 3.9736324210967684
he said sternly.: 1.2452015768802498
He added in a preacher’s tone:  —For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns.: 1.7140435596838923
Slow music, please.: 1.575286407710646

A little trouble about those white corpuscles.: 1.474192070869928
Silence, all.: 1.8187990221353114
He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points.: 1.5989206044980393
Chrysostomos.: 2.420709619727489
Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm.: 2.170507950277988
—Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly.: 2.618333394803352
That will do nicely.: 2.5217587069510787
Switch off the current, will you?: 1.5896581857756003
He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown.: 1.5542147454951776
The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.: 1.5267502109823299
A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.: 1.8149976059940165
—The mockery of it!: 1.5199001728052777
he said gaily.: 1.2388563504292613
Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!: 1.546942207480249
He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself.: 1.9207419386069402
Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck.: 1.7113425610754645
Buck Mulligan’s gay voice went on.: 3.0506747157430802
—My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls.: 2.2411202789324927
But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn’t it?: 1.7946887432593341
Tripping and sunny like the buck himself.: 1.4390700588657515
We must go to Athens.: 2.3551985639528636
Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?: 1.7773090438576205
He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:  —Will he come?: 1.8077967714461556
The jejune jesuit!: 2.0204431222267316
Ceasing, he began to shave with care.: 3.0730358218367337

—Yes, my love?: 12.511212835224505
—How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?: 1.7591058822669008
Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.: 1.9747071779235166
—God, isn’t he dreadful?: 3.4736335942597196
he said frankly.: 1.2366554911670782
A ponderous Saxon.: 1.2321206436677568
He thinks you’re not a gentleman.: 2.451264857975309
Bursting with money and indigestion.: 1.984726743750644
Because he comes from Oxford.: 1.8433850773715335
You know, Dedalus, you have the real Oxford manner.: 2.740442253949786
He can’t make you out.: 3.56386137529885
O, my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.: 2.3000454549612326
He shaved warily over his chin.: 2.230622972344621
—He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said.: 2.2491677684242206
Where is his guncase?: 7.700496993829322
—A woful lunatic!: 1.3300134058407465
Mulligan said.: 1.7129012515084658
Were you in a funk?: 7.036860788033597
—I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear.: 3.44445653090083
Out here in the dark with a man I don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther.: 2.2137413752263426
You saved men from drowning.: 1.5865743818979985
I’m not a hero, however.: 3.5332595394666457
If he stays on here I am off.: 1.6069702563209143
Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade.: 1.7948064399840156
He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.: 2.31156950286478
—Scutter!: 5.540182956634215
he cried thickly.: 1.2165072715588032
He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper pocket, said:  —Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.: 1.9397576764033937
Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief.: 1.7122708771572814
Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.: 1.4579722372727397
Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:  —The bard’s noserag!: 2.7487526151306843
A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.: 1.4921455613417094
You can almost taste it, can’t you?: 2.819020732032003
He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly.: 1.9682180675499619
—God!: 13.130258689089832
he said quietly.: 2.7791313796760044
Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet mother?: 2.3097081086910407
The snotgreen sea.: 1.2302513351681297
The scrotumtightening sea.: 1.2302513351681297
_Epi oinopa ponton_.: 1.1719544252990588
Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks!: 2.165190403505086
I must teach you.: 1.3565530372300592
You must read them in the original.: 2.2948027086692564
_Thalatta!: 8.936658005791672
Thalatta!_ She is our great sweet mother.: 3.415662511193476
Come and look.: 1.6842139399951848
Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet.: 2.760110354345053
Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown.: 3.5005400650358274
—Our mighty mother!: 1.9877588207490693
Buck Mulligan said.: 1.5481045530981867
He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s face.: 2.310435479332205
—The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said.: 1.7496750978541225
That’s why she won’t let me have anything to do with you.: 3.359927727571067
—Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.: 4.602519680129443
—You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you, Buck Mulligan said.: 1.9537775016243857
But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her.: 1.9881277851508012
And you refused.: 1.1440223003503829
There is something sinister in you....: 1.4343104087933483
He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek.: 1.4717916086403136
A tolerant smile curled his lips.: 2.4614590827099634
—But a lovely mummer!: 2.8656967593836393
he murmured to himself.: 1.4813627791654302
Kinch, the loveliest mummer of them all!: 3.941918179935102
He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.: 1.615516136103808
Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.: 2.0971978551278725
Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart.: 2.1105684492062027
Silently, in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of wetted ashes.: 1.6386112934428005
Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him.: 3.1001593119594935
The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid.: 1.538035130784897
A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.: 1.583770940109554
Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.: 2.2341899887934162
—Ah, poor dogsbody!: 2.8751521283365573
I must give you a shirt and a few noserags.: 2.4145988068509356
How are the secondhand breeks?: 5.416408232590197
—They fit well enough, Stephen answered.: 1.8252472421478272
Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.: 3.1354075296536217
—The mockery of it, he said contentedly.: 3.348803804810093
Secondleg they should be.: 1.651683951135004
God knows what poxy bowsy left them off.: 2.386235099545673
I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe, grey.: 2.3634781459668672
You’ll look spiffing in them.: 2.758481132551605
I’m not joking, Kinch.: 3.0804753824222812
You look damn well when you’re dressed.: 3.5466786768493774
—Thanks, Stephen said.: 3.609696849353742
I can’t wear them if they are grey.: 3.581510679784738
—He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.: 3.1378329053485725
Etiquette is etiquette.: 1.18937813744319
He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey trousers.: 2.117582009322004
He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin.: 1.3919466263869253
Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes.: 2.7192192558498602
—That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says you have g.: 2.247651342078948

He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea.: 1.6624578053261043
His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth.: 1.4762597893912046
Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk.: 2.432494238555463
—Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!: 3.5560954341318496
Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a crooked crack.: 2.009196706984164

Lead him not into temptation.: 1.5434873175504638
And her name is Ursula.: 1.537956480370938
Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen’s peering eyes.: 2.9501117601843503
—The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said.: 1.7322338450737627
If Wilde were only alive to see you!: 1.8624832126419746

The cracked lookingglass of a servant.: 1.6135335123354884
—It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it?: 2.822248509989119
he said kindly.: 2.3349456050185338
God knows you have more spirit than any of them.: 1.6619616101706027

Buck Mulligan asked impatiently.: 2.289593701594892
Cough it up.: 2.7280404293181815
I’m quite frank with you.: 2.7680230288387007
What have you against me now?: 2.062652305238732
They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale.: 1.7113618210230295

—Do you wish me to tell you?: 3.4013246554811736
he asked.: 4.058900803730759
—Yes, what is it?: 4.5071941641419215
Buck Mulligan answered.: 2.190423062281935
I don’t remember anything.: 3.58680589125724
He looked in Stephen’s face as he spoke.: 2.906861585186272
A light wind passed his brow, fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes.: 1.6920201210007735
Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:  —Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s death?: 2.994031495676306
Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:  —What?: 2.7905851847700243
Where?: 6.645876832604564
I can’t remember anything.: 3.4195650248191383
I remember only ideas and sensations.: 1.31003405338191
What happened in the name of God?: 4.510502496511368
—You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get more hot water.: 2.275850290985988
She asked you who was in your room.: 3.602729711695872
—Yes?: 19.916459654563926
Buck Mulligan said.: 1.5481045530981867
What did I say?: 2.88393679461598
I forget.: 8.975984014320503
—You said, Stephen answered, _O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly dead._  A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan’s cheek.: 2.19011563800256
—Did I say that?: 5.004762691572082
he asked.: 4.058900803730759
Well?: 7.622280227213387
What harm is that?: 1.4832313969760373
He shook his constraint from him nervously.: 3.327266266793375
—And what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own?: 2.63911546008639
You saw only your mother die.: 1.4312197722837883
It’s a beastly thing and nothing else.: 2.9578414789633745
It simply doesn’t matter.: 2.7585762636721545
You wouldn’t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you.: 2.1413147182423447
Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it’s injected the wrong way.: 1.9925511773893958
To me it’s all a mockery and beastly.: 2.8142779563472464
Her cerebral lobes are not functioning.: 1.3403914655785745
She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt.: 1.757625035811917
Humour her till it’s over.: 2.9398414196926606
You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don’t whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette’s.: 2.0578860685853555
Absurd!: 4.815433498404449
I suppose I did say it.: 2.038457019248215
I didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother.: 2.6709284791758967
He had spoken himself into boldness.: 1.3207983714532672
Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:  —I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.: 2.521611841575687
—Of what then?: 3.830313637421771
Buck Mulligan asked.: 21.63633460760374
—Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.: 3.6599279629744914
Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.: 2.4912497894527528
—O, an impossible person!: 3.1138732665513165
he exclaimed.: 2.279493949619239
He walked off quickly round the parapet.: 1.453605392976597
Stephen stood at his post, gazing over the calm sea towards the headland.: 1.5373611419893147
Sea and headland now grew dim.: 1.2460607325453419
Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt the fever of his cheeks.: 2.172432876596928
A voice within the tower called loudly:  —Are you up there, Mulligan?: 2.242045789427257
—I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.: 3.623369214955587
He turned towards Stephen and said:  —Look at the sea.: 2.600103548260284
What does it care about offences?: 1.614777456483474
Chuck Loyola, Kinch, and come on down.: 2.0052807881041317
The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.: 1.2501860437075147
His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level with the roof:  —Don’t mope over it all day, he said.: 2.2827651332522807
Give up the moody brooding.: 1.385115581091016
His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead:       And no more turn aside and brood      Upon love’s bitter mystery      For Fergus rules the brazen cars.: 1.7004396115315275
Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed.: 1.5143128697769963
Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet.: 1.5124642403879391
White breast of the dim sea.: 1.505210404747778
The twining stresses, two by two.: 1.9476452623800957
A hand plucking the harpstrings, merging their twining chords.: 3.2169935814285213
Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide.: 1.3666032187354953
It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters.: 1.9496170349931115
Fergus’ song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords.: 1.892483367653619
Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music.: 1.7818867494381005
Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside.: 1.8277411914042765
She was crying in her wretched bed.: 1.3949952484254122
For those words, Stephen: love’s bitter mystery.: 1.9448637398083735
Where now?: 1.725013297171586
Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer.: 2.3408860137647833
A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl.: 2.262917120822648
She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang:       I am the boy      That can enjoy      Invisibility.: 1.818662413566426
Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.: 1.5110342268437096
And no more turn aside and brood.: 1.3754878229682146
Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys.: 2.0310959786776035
Memories beset his brooding brain.: 1.383929151730744
Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament.: 1.8547721527673493
A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening.: 1.526214005334016
Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s shirts.: 2.1625699460824497
In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.: 1.7032665417467732
Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul.: 2.110163555244321
On me alone.: 1.5314302292133286
The ghostcandle to light her agony.: 2.503176115102592
Ghostly light on the tortured face.: 1.7858857212682198
Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their knees.: 1.5587881943865745
Her eyes on me to strike me down.: 1.8678405546638692

Chewer of corpses!: 1.2231796369034
No, mother!: 1.74971478930674
Let me be and let me live.: 3.7958637510719053
—Kinch ahoy!: 1.7987250845471103
Buck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower.: 3.1122136027554568
It came nearer up the staircase, calling again.: 1.9255064690471726
Stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry, heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.: 2.260159107629626
—Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey.: 3.0926212558771167
Breakfast is ready.: 1.2068136114783676
Haines is apologising for waking us last night.: 2.0645515486659325
—I’m coming, Stephen said, turning.: 4.305447456575465
—Do, for Jesus’ sake, Buck Mulligan said.: 2.11589262469338
For my sake and for all our sakes.: 2.71632327474188
His head disappeared and reappeared.: 3.3866546275961946
—I told him your symbol of Irish art.: 2.0899374728112865
He says it’s very clever.: 2.8054698377767764
Touch him for a quid, will you?: 2.481336891380638
A guinea, I mean.: 3.269281606820153
—The school kip?: 1.5787296853031667
Buck Mulligan said.: 1.5481045530981867
How much?: 9.532313401732214
Four quid?: 1.6567099603097075
Lend us one.: 22.744348640554982
—If you want it, Stephen said.: 3.491027909448756
—Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight.: 2.127247906564145
We’ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids.: 3.483122399417859
Four omnipotent sovereigns.: 1.1143849247111595
He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tune with a Cockney accent:       O, won’t we have a merry time,      Drinking whisky, beer and wine!: 1.8842440370384816
On coronation,      Coronation day!: 1.2328217768858665
O, won’t we have a merry time      On coronation day!: 2.066111802370202
Warm sunshine merrying over the sea.: 3.040336501864411
The nickel shavingbowl shone, forgotten, on the parapet.: 1.9756276040856633
Why should I bring it down?: 1.897203750319711
Or leave it there all day, forgotten friendship?: 1.8551209255870853
He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.: 2.178135640315
So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes.: 1.4624570432419852
I am another now and yet the same.: 1.5602959607726037
A servant too.: 1.219579535748295
A server of a servant.: 2.182724728842192
In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan’s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its yellow glow.: 1.922954008124781
Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.: 1.821782701015987
—We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said.: 2.706968065444198
Haines, open that door, will you?: 1.5891138441059793
Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker.: 1.6437854692313683
A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors.: 2.276708879620452
—Have you the key?: 5.906993403884381
a voice asked.: 6.837984880329115
—Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said.: 2.039437319261794
Janey Mack, I’m choked!: 3.0911872711595314
He howled, without looking up from the fire:  —Kinch!: 3.0481975826445957
—It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.: 3.7612782195032426
The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered.: 1.6657959161120586
Haines stood at the doorway, looking out.: 2.551304382622209
Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait.: 2.934071929262665
Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him.: 1.9742257790820137
Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief.: 2.379051111264315
—I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when...: 3.5199128447390775
But, hush!: 1.207790627515692
Not a word more on that subject!: 1.793513577446125
Kinch, wake up!: 1.3706603355225622
Bread, butter, honey.: 1.861439388941247
Haines, come in.: 1.6996800205007074
The grub is ready.: 1.2438696727636505
Where’s the sugar?: 5.80706930704223
O, jay, there’s no milk.: 2.414939023730935
Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker.: 2.5710971352327427
Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.: 3.50927163058198
—What sort of a kip is this?: 2.1620596620905568
he said.: 3.156209769095999
I told her to come after eight.: 4.118918980365708
—We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily.: 3.0885955566721237
There’s a lemon in the locker.: 3.6226667633590712
—O, damn you and your Paris fads!: 2.621095592905135
Buck Mulligan said.: 1.5481045530981867
I want Sandycove milk.: 1.2382798742143166
Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:  —That woman is coming up with the milk.: 2.69482568224614
—The blessings of God on you!: 1.5152185130053393
Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his chair.: 2.059048655433264
Sit down.: 6.742088081735048
Pour out the tea there.: 1.9318291984802438
The sugar is in the bag.: 2.7423210006598047
Here, I can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs.: 3.4621924465939893
He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates, saying:  —_In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti._  Haines sat down to pour out the tea.: 2.548029772317083
—I’m giving you two lumps each, he said.: 2.2974295585329334
Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman’s wheedling voice:  —When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said.: 1.9894409848349053
And when I makes water I makes water.: 3.29651186369156
—By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.: 2.5645947054076363
Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:  —_So I do, Mrs Cahill,_ says she.: 2.0132826440023734
_Begob, ma’am,_ says Mrs Cahill, _God send you don’t make them in the one pot._  He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife.: 2.6207834378117894
—That’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines.: 2.9043273563543357
Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum.: 2.019621207676384
Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.: 1.9914655775562957
He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows:  —Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?: 1.98173029222732
—I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.: 2.905681845463239
—Do you now?: 7.626295105936395
Buck Mulligan said in the same tone.: 5.214104492849858
Your reasons, pray?: 8.237754244306577
—I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion.: 2.4379620809621567
Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.: 3.1214694465903237
Buck Mulligan’s face smiled with delight.: 3.753858379031865
—Charming!: 4.849067398474481
he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly.: 1.9647186880538998
Do you think she was?: 3.1862165213447455
Quite charming!: 1.658065147185408
Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:  _—For old Mary Ann  She doesn’t care a damn.: 2.377326892929677
But, hising up her petticoats..._  He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.: 1.4941226979514914
The doorway was darkened by an entering form.: 2.1060231935581424
—The milk, sir!: 6.620269852086293
—Come in, ma’am, Mulligan said.: 2.3056456373797043
Kinch, get the jug.: 1.6859788748173201
An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen’s elbow.: 3.70839172416127
—That’s a lovely morning, sir, she said.: 2.9356976441756224
Glory be to God.: 2.8308894059438314
—To whom?: 6.224395711701583
Mulligan said, glancing at her.: 3.34204292662164
Ah, to be sure!: 3.9198748178039664
Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.: 2.7858974803967884
—The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of the collector of prepuces.: 2.783194742309339
—How much, sir?: 2.9533064951474666
asked the old woman.: 5.092314522508776
—A quart, Stephen said.: 2.4781243903405454
Old shrunken paps.: 1.1719544252990588
She poured again a measureful and a tilly.: 2.9116621731412424
Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger.: 1.4561283674582532
Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs.: 1.6903678289841972
They lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle.: 1.9504550710090012
Silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times.: 1.7532628035424478
A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning.: 1.9131700785820853
To serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.: 2.597180688786389
—It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.: 2.617769790488793
—Taste it, sir, she said.: 2.8600061468048215
He drank at her bidding.: 3.8627501229902577
—If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts.: 2.331333854526784
Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits.: 3.1672471933150623
—Are you a medical student, sir?: 3.0287994936711957
the old woman asked.: 12.200905761660662
—I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered.: 2.9836189990052255
—Look at that now, she said.: 3.6703711860254025
Stephen listened in scornful silence.: 1.2865745897409122
She bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she slights.: 2.1357628465145124
To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in God’s likeness, the serpent’s prey.: 1.8819085073025565
And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.: 2.003892522210721
—Do you understand what he says?: 4.21599342853957
Stephen asked her.: 9.392171638096674
—Is it French you are talking, sir?: 2.5258223793545307
the old woman said to Haines.: 2.7324827561537592
Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.: 2.6176642314697585
—Irish, Buck Mulligan said.: 2.461516214991741
Is there Gaelic on you?: 3.080832296514215
—I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it.: 3.4205901634233387
Are you from the west, sir?: 3.5387387859632375
—I am an Englishman, Haines answered.: 4.417509151713002
—He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland.: 3.1256426358248808
—Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak the language myself.: 3.056470257119272
I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows.: 3.836100185339325
—Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan.: 1.900092234660517
Wonderful entirely.: 1.604575814556274
Fill us out some more tea, Kinch.: 1.5710736986927456
Would you like a cup, ma’am?: 3.7835812201590273
—No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go.: 2.554279060093871
Haines said to her:  —Have you your bill?: 2.1817776119161287
We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?: 2.4514000028387883
Stephen filled again the three cups.: 2.9111709128440277
—Bill, sir?: 1.7663850098315577
she said, halting.: 7.3956962961036705
Well, it’s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling.: 1.7786327360039984
That’s a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.: 2.894549994180396
Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets.: 1.8780059358388737
—Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.: 2.648742887818128
Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk.: 1.4272173065528533
Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried:  —A miracle!: 1.9628695729646723
He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:  —Ask nothing more of me, sweet.: 2.3117769945350806
All I can give you I give.: 2.579230579014555
Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.: 3.606963476981778
—We’ll owe twopence, he said.: 2.486880647906771
—Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin.: 3.35658462288607
Time enough.: 3.574589216359428
Good morning, sir.: 2.337444351320174
She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant:  _—Heart of my heart, were it more,  More would be laid at your feet._  He turned to Stephen and said:  —Seriously, Dedalus.: 2.157766008713892
I’m stony.: 7.647450027572179
Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money.: 1.547497632731516
Today the bards must drink and junket.: 1.570403315797755
Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty.: 2.1209556246177463
—That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your national library today.: 2.7541981552596604
—Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.: 1.5869940849775157
He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:  —Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?: 1.8925932554128673
Then he said to Haines:  —The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.: 2.5459792716697973
—All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf.: 1.9675937736014253
Speaking to me.: 2.486650686973668
They wash and tub and scrub.: 1.3271375144742674
Agenbite of inwit.: 1.385185120942213
Conscience.: 3.0324287377854287
Yet here’s a spot.: 7.937828702118582
—That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good.: 1.848170424471694
Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone:  —Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.: 2.500639867449893
—Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen.: 3.0795408590083664
I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.: 2.435538578334859
—Would I make any money by it?: 1.971503422825043
Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock, said:  —I don’t know, I’m sure.: 3.466504801843563
He strolled out to the doorway.: 3.036127881319257
Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour:  —You put your hoof in it now.: 2.057605980670401
What did you say that for?: 4.7019852674274905
—Well?: 22.86684068164016
Stephen said.: 3.459974694862643
The problem is to get money.: 1.5889602487690944
From whom?: 3.9078335683685594
From the milkwoman or from him.: 6.294324758709278
—I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.: 2.4203557584479976
—I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.: 2.6649000652483488
Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm.: 2.339162522748904
—From me, Kinch, he said.: 3.29481671011522
In a suddenly changed tone he added:  —To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right.: 2.4217769012293204
Damn all else they are good for.: 1.7384254216046064
Why don’t you play them as I do?: 2.949142896909485
To hell with them all.: 2.3337602216222684
Let us get out of the kip.: 3.0583050646278296
He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying resignedly:  —Mulligan is stripped of his garments.: 1.7234982782717518
He emptied his pockets on to the table.: 3.468367580886757
—There’s your snotrag, he said.: 4.599361807918446
And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain.: 1.8265975059067376
His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief.: 2.092253442933727
God, we’ll simply have to dress the character.: 2.202197311620761
I want puce gloves and green boots.: 1.542891974647594
Contradiction.: 2.420709619727489
Do I contradict myself?: 1.604861310674972
Very well then, I contradict myself.: 1.8607506654122625
Mercurial Malachi.: 2.7492211033651777
A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands.: 2.5467705199771133
—And there’s your Latin quarter hat, he said.: 3.297222823719023
Stephen picked it up and put it on.: 3.1617878796756402
Haines called to them from the doorway:  —Are you coming, you fellows?: 2.5461670812196284
—I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door.: 2.740598738983729
Come out, Kinch.: 1.6985375883645857
You have eaten all we left, I suppose.: 1.7385050990593895
Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:  —And going forth he met Butterly.: 2.0447884827508576
Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked it.: 2.1747829654881876
He put the huge key in his inner pocket.: 1.8014574559929353
At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:  —Did you bring the key?: 2.321519113896235
—I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.: 3.4739744309934144
He walked on.: 3.6231651686813366
Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.: 1.8553766480953136
—Down, sir!: 4.586560546973712
How dare you, sir!: 2.8486423896031337
Haines asked:  —Do you pay rent for this tower?: 2.3125212873688774
—Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.: 1.6074136976966988
—To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.: 2.001818437470274
They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:  —Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say.: 1.5909472004438447
Martello you call it?: 3.289657576767462
—Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on the sea.: 2.610137658723187
But ours is the _omphalos_.: 1.393827121779259
Haines asked Stephen.: 6.522186352788816
—No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain.: 3.9007684002435514
I’m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up.: 2.749207656624527
Wait till I have a few pints in me first.: 2.666781169241971
He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat:  —You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?: 2.382309302800868
—It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.: 2.670017209157992
—You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably.: 2.6777311624468307
Is it some paradox?: 4.5515113432304855
—Pooh!: 2.0898687147847532
Buck Mulligan said.: 1.5481045530981867
We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.: 1.3765149223818678
It’s quite simple.: 7.299075965978806
He proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father.: 2.1289022645849194
—What?: 9.840555452504102
He himself?: 5.679208129249694
Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in loose laughter, said to Stephen’s ear:  —O, shade of Kinch the elder!: 2.101215567820118
Japhet in search of a father!: 3.690054895675231
—We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines.: 3.521588040613585
And it is rather long to tell.: 2.163895327134976
Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.: 2.786232622853276
—The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.: 1.8708980726483813
—I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore.: 1.8435756321035945
_That beetles o’er his base into the sea,_ isn’t it?: 2.0760353239225076
Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak.: 1.7019865144707729
In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.: 1.547902460807585
Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.: 1.6076461342939348
The seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins.: 2.122655831381894
—I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.: 2.385939394349303
The Father and the Son idea.: 2.7797176777266537
The Son striving to be atoned with the Father.: 4.720488823645553
Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face.: 1.412367298568852
He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety.: 2.2412075372940072
He moved a doll’s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:  _—I’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.: 2.5651164327944156
My mother’s a jew, my father’s a bird.: 4.750058229127542
With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.: 1.5698436608826651
So here’s to disciples and Calvary._  He held up a forefinger of warning.: 4.011979665366591
_—If anyone thinks that I amn’t divine He’ll get no free drinks when I’m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water again._  He tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:  _—Goodbye, now, goodbye!: 1.8950458804032755
Write down all I said And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.: 1.8536575855622446
What’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly And Olivet’s breezy...: 2.5998738712381755
Goodbye, now, goodbye!_  He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.: 1.7442089268522436
Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and said:  —We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose.: 2.285403088207359
He’s rather blasphemous.: 6.854028077064252
Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn’t it?: 2.0472969900958424
What did he call it?: 2.931406469633119
Joseph the Joiner?: 27.462988002657394
—The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.: 1.980598538071602
—O, Haines said, you have heard it before?: 4.969708351631134
—Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.: 3.498764934902661
—You’re not a believer, are you?: 2.5170499981615646
Haines asked.: 3.986968000735017
I mean, a believer in the narrow sense of the word.: 2.2952603459598313
Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God.: 1.7196183117919102
—There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.: 2.96597489032901
Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone.: 1.4748188617683993
He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.: 2.8114796922203142
—Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.: 3.824321151553234
Haines helped himself and snapped the case to.: 1.6544656895986243
He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.: 1.9459669253474958
—Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again.: 4.551389245455904
Either you believe or you don’t, isn’t it?: 2.3932731009928947
Personally I couldn’t stomach that idea of a personal God.: 2.0380757706884376
You don’t stand for that, I suppose?: 4.198373019180017
—You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible example of free thought.: 2.4536770147511033
He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side.: 1.9147212264352333
Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.: 1.6919363524212392
My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen!: 1.802898778885995
A wavering line along the path.: 1.5487446367071953
He wants that key.: 1.3616747599662826
It is mine.: 1.427609774818918
I paid the rent.: 1.4126178531288405
Now I eat his salt bread.: 1.3235226203197452
Give him the key too.: 2.6150191832420258
All.: 6.052131618485058
He will ask for it.: 1.460689814508158
That was in his eyes.: 5.67530175261575
—After all, Haines began...: 2.976102644131054
Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind.: 1.970552667892986
—After all, I should think you are able to free yourself.: 2.147927414814702
You are your own master, it seems to me.: 1.964868061816687
—I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian.: 3.046334832096263
—Italian?: 5.1080838033499205
Haines said.: 4.106572195552516
A crazy queen, old and jealous.: 1.5220249451855534
Kneel down before me.: 4.730680731327945
—Italian?: 5.1080838033499205
Haines said again.: 1.4954517937836023
What do you mean?: 8.489771634808433
—The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.: 1.9620712857364746
Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke.: 1.4578565694324195
An Irishman must think like that, I daresay.: 2.3465091166164456
We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly.: 1.6683284064700592
It seems history is to blame.: 1.3619743657155166
The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen’s memory the triumph of their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam:_ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars.: 2.101127783756452
Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs.: 1.8471343701782403
A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ’s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son.: 1.7723190612256372
Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger.: 1.6417820454103687
Idle mockery.: 1.5776425891193573
The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael’s host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields.: 2.260632882405926
Prolonged applause.: 1.4478852574705654
_Zut!: 8.936658005791672
Nom de Dieu!_  —Of course I’m a Britisher, Haines’s voice said, and I feel as one.: 2.798785605159103
I don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.: 2.4003173168107566
That’s our national problem, I’m afraid, just now.: 3.1225792249075903
Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.: 2.591558295677894
—She’s making for Bullock harbour.: 2.5960370548877134
The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.: 2.0347301174561476
—There’s five fathoms out there, he said.: 2.7079642503881467
It’ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one.: 2.0290134699976234
It’s nine days today.: 3.340191476189085
The man that was drowned.: 2.8387592121475476
A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite.: 2.0281565370283534
Here I am.: 3.282420139754385
They followed the winding path down to the creek.: 1.9784706243082524
Buck Mulligan stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder.: 2.382976904504583
A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.: 1.7962433610385764
—Is the brother with you, Malachi?: 4.974722537123069
—Down in Westmeath.: 3.840108216251242
With the Bannons.: 9.587555219504587
—Still there?: 6.051988174050794
I got a card from Bannon.: 1.592830778932318
Says he found a sweet young thing down there.: 1.5328541734726966
Photo girl he calls her.: 1.961343950608592
—Snapshot, eh?: 1.4597406532825525
Brief exposure.: 1.583403391336072
Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots.: 3.1708402798082638
An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face.: 1.7015991724747332
He scrambled up by the stones, water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth.: 2.135394270656461
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone.: 1.9854176734048539
—Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of rock.: 2.056390369626959
Chucked medicine and going in for the army.: 2.291964490219916
—Ah, go to God!: 2.8996631893197193
Buck Mulligan said.: 1.5481045530981867
—Going over next week to stew.: 1.578109446323196
You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?: 3.227254013451228
—Yes.: 10.458765153873907
—Spooning with him last night on the pier.: 1.9205754868787017
The father is rotto with money.: 2.468903867959464
—Is she up the pole?: 5.209052605623469
—Better ask Seymour that.: 4.555601606371959
—Seymour a bleeding officer!: 1.5233547541172232
Buck Mulligan said.: 1.5481045530981867
He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying tritely:  —Redheaded women buck like goats.: 1.9628929089931906
He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.: 2.1310990529484894
—My twelfth rib is gone, he cried.: 1.831313658475966
I’m the _Übermensch._ Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen.: 2.5557905056417622
He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay.: 2.593291290700291
—Are you going in here, Malachi?: 5.897602596628375
—Yes.: 10.458765153873907
Make room in the bed.: 2.0434562562325698
The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes.: 1.8992891643353196
Haines sat down on a stone, smoking.: 4.666589388943417
—Are you not coming in?: 4.453706005368471
Buck Mulligan asked.: 21.63633460760374
—Later on, Haines said.: 2.799498129990625
Not on my breakfast.: 2.0800936651506894
Stephen turned away.: 17.120606021112998
—I’m going, Mulligan, he said.: 3.347945100047104
—Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.: 3.0793509240056465
Stephen handed him the key.: 2.6929009780799302
Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes.: 2.1361750414489884
—And twopence, he said, for a pint.: 3.223151841214772
Throw it there.: 1.6930149400806775
Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap.: 1.6248702333182332
Buck Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:  —He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord.: 1.645938065207803
Thus spake Zarathustra.: 1.2012846516222362
His plump body plunged.: 4.397606157929217
—We’ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish.: 2.1413110142165452
Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.: 2.1687350244018124
—The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried.: 3.0556679194079783
Half twelve.: 2.672487680049023
—Good, Stephen said.: 3.5065056533440884

Mr Deasy said I was to copy them off the board, sir.: 2.9072544388108374
—Can you do them yourself?: 6.6385166891007215

She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been.: 1.555939875765698

Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem.: 2.4426113955986586

Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes.: 1.9984090692284064
Give hands, traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors.: 1.7464750300218843

With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.: 1.502355265366496
Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness.: 1.751069337785354
My childhood bends beside me.: 1.3267365143105299

Mine is far and his secret as our eyes.: 1.4998661505208073

The sum was done.: 3.5628090667099457
—It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.: 3.4854331687959155

He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench.: 1.8085010179496435
—You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form.: 2.945371933277569
In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.: 2.0512212342119103
—Sargent!: 7.46274019296471
—Run on, Stephen said.: 2.6800761025356103
Mr Deasy is calling you.: 1.2702477856583336
He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife.: 1.9568816113494085
They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet.: 1.8320567822761096
When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him.: 2.157859539050078
He turned his angry white moustache.: 3.3240427748519674
—What is it now?: 3.7247861365906183
he cried continually without listening.: 2.8803798329518346
—Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.: 2.266559892253036
—Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore order here.: 2.468885345710648
And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice cried sternly:  —What is the matter?: 2.579508587542399
What is it now?: 3.4344790279362574
Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.: 2.164351910459847
Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs.: 2.33801657397636

As it was in the beginning, is now.: 3.660666290708333
On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be.: 1.4860779352452473

A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor.: 2.1275114071337966
Blowing out his rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.: 1.9447517006849486
—First, our little financial settlement, he said.: 2.2289241818964327
He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong.: 2.021795778180373
It slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid them carefully on the table.: 1.9252467619408014
—Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.: 2.382786128510008
And now his strongroom for the gold.: 3.297731841106956
Stephen’s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir’s turban, and this, the scallop of saint James.: 2.680962321271365
An old pilgrim’s hoard, dead treasure, hollow shells.: 1.3987707719899387

And here crowns.: 1.2228097442080095
See.: 4.727888929029264
He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.: 1.980488349411486
—Three twelve, he said.: 1.7563446100983917
I think you’ll find that’s right.: 3.9651214438962485
—Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.: 2.3644176428165955
You have earned it.: 1.2161746281781138
Stephen’s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells.: 2.810781950820277
Symbols too of beauty and of power.: 1.9187519142657374
A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery.: 1.7349143673535043
—Don’t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said.: 3.3393644412932044
You’ll pull it out somewhere and lose it.: 2.157899435216665
You just buy one of these machines.: 2.124338988836823
You’ll find them very handy.: 2.637604805684714
Answer something.: 10.608539601568994

The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same.: 1.9236519176531701
Three times now.: 1.2219853614494822

Well?: 7.622280227213387
I can break them in this instant if I will.: 2.1093184042871314

But no matter.: 1.758175221719993
O’Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly:  —One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe.: 2.314695683597909
It was in that case of fratricide, the Childs murder case.: 2.242334660130494

Pause.: 2.0143610267965997

Something quite ordinary.: 1.2400785938513754
Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.: 1.6733907385335451
I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match, that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.: 1.7613228680683062
A POLISHED PERIOD   J.: 1.1971297894754422
O’Molloy resumed, moulding his words:  —He said of it: _that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to live._  His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.: 1.857358959504313
—Fine!: 5.977424847869572
Myles Crawford said at once.: 5.8205523919086435

—You like it?: 4.609381287321523
O’Molloy asked Stephen.: 4.134276191237109
Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed.: 1.674946465760499
He took a cigarette from the case.: 2.1890551600804677
O’Molloy offered his case to Myles Crawford.: 2.1799400987901376
Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy, saying:  —Muchibus thankibus.: 2.692304220105391
A MAN OF HIGH MORALE   —Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J.: 1.7866693209959972
O’Molloy said to Stephen.: 4.308053060969872
What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush poets: A.: 2.245656737649265
E.: 1.7201479306608167
the mastermystic?: 22.035632567553517
That Blavatsky woman started it.: 1.4099237415164716
She was a nice old bag of tricks.: 2.7755223576997032
E.: 1.7201479306608167
has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness.: 1.8747616421324271
Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A.: 2.4063065899705003
E.’s leg.: 1.492659732786225
He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.: 2.470850177236075
Speaking about me.: 1.6482290896540088
What did he say?: 3.0653246189966246
What did he say?: 3.0653246189966246
What did he say about me?: 2.496005769448904
Don’t ask.: 16.17386873239534
—No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.: 2.2998729743655044
Let me say one thing.: 1.4277270635141426
The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical society.: 1.601396494600182
Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days), advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.: 1.7077676192132614
He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:  —You know Gerald Fitzgibbon.: 2.3144076028082363
Then you can imagine the style of his discourse.: 2.487526267832387
—He is sitting with Tim Healy, J.: 2.657204015112986
—He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child’s frock.: 3.0617942462639163
Go on.: 7.033053191459626
Well?: 7.622280227213387
—It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely upon the new movement.: 2.6116273018791745
It was then a new movement.: 2.3315812793718766
We were weak, therefore worthless.: 1.3635924338788346
He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.: 1.792976003167822
IMPROMPTU   In ferial tone he addressed J.: 1.4556530118843447
O’Molloy:  —Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed.: 2.379684558444199
That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall.: 2.7102714237538508
His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it.: 1.370623581155838
He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked (though he was not) a dying man.: 1.8509901345136455
His gaze turned at once but slowly from J.: 1.4831805538579832
O’Molloy’s towards Stephen’s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking.: 2.6868792393236927
His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair.: 1.4655625885770935
Still seeking, he said:  —When Fitzgibbon’s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.: 2.157493230536203
Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.: 2.1228800454695347
He raised his head firmly.: 2.115401396576486
His eyes bethought themselves once more.: 2.0688100294975427
Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.: 3.185062235777647
He began:  _—Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend.: 1.749673997895816
It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses._  His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech.: 1.7844908740835457
_And let our crooked smokes._ Noble words coming.: 1.4202952351082574

_—And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride.: 1.9350881124255617

He lifted his voice above it boldly:  _—But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day.: 1.8677138863317178

Terence O’Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda.: 1.7616880542435287
For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.: 1.6856208911369257
Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.: 2.2476709945371907

Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.: 1.9439543419394498
In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face.: 1.6282540822984513
Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus.: 1.9380501861936341
Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels.: 2.7303309509051545
In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them.: 1.8329657217803246
Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature.: 2.1324748730232335
Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief.: 1.4390674800064291
Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power.: 1.7332681751720147
It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: _We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body.: 1.7769069327518734
Mind C.: 1.424890885772777
K.: 1.4806011546975872
doesn’t pile it on._ It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H.: 2.4142103911321318
O’Neill’s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements.: 2.0884003479797686
Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen’s to be soled only as the heels were still good.: 1.9433289055871568
He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.: 1.7884602481163816
Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.: 1.7891035840629055

Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow.: 3.3737981936269397
Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.: 2.730895821204834
—There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.: 3.7135498299881475
—Bloom, says he.: 3.6437179949259377
He’s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.: 3.1392335246109373

Little Alf was knocked bawways.: 1.4140295552197857
Faith, he was.: 9.284683102096315
—Good Christ!: 2.657323895262385
I could have sworn it was him.: 2.0645556002728687
And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he’s under the influence:  —Who said Christ is good?: 2.3935724914997256
—I beg your parsnips, says Alf.: 2.026950136023433
—Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?: 2.6259055295926443
—Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off.: 3.2988780225508587
He’s over all his troubles.: 3.847995863257897
But Bob Doran shouts out of him.: 1.8748663548922495
—He’s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.: 2.4362259978921617
Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn’t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises.: 1.8812420507358596
And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you’re there.: 1.8794136563051587
—The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.: 2.3082041232248556
The tear is bloody near your eye.: 1.30544035412994
Talking through his bloody hat.: 1.5068814846440868
Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff’s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.: 2.261941483384426
—The noblest, the truest, says he.: 1.8136365497940945
And he’s gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.: 2.772917023041582
And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.: 1.803604728799639
Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.: 1.7680255426208544
—Come in, come on, he won’t eat you, says the citizen.: 2.969045112861293
So Bloom slopes in with his cod’s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.: 2.367032799051368
—O, Christ M’Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters.: 3.9364783070309763
Listen to this, will you?: 2.1774513922962258
And he starts reading out one.: 2.035191807208457
_7 Hunter Street, Liverpool._   _To the High Sheriff of Dublin,             Dublin._   _Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i hanged..._  —Show us, Joe, says I.: 2.189399032787974
—_...: 17.230249383640242
private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when..._  —Jesus, says I.: 2.0335725379161915
—_...: 17.230249383640242
Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith..._  The citizen made a grab at the letter.: 1.86519087030768
—Hold hard, says Joe, _i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can’t get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five ginnees._  _H.: 2.0666760244170965
Rumbold,             Master Barber._   —And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.: 2.889838348835883
—And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe.: 2.0687068727981024
Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf.: 2.5857097777341003
Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?: 3.2629912381540302
So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn’t and he couldn’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he’d just take a cigar.: 2.2614134386998916
Gob, he’s a prudent member and no mistake.: 2.900203771249423
—Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.: 2.4932438382283717
And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.: 2.040091922927618
—They’re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.: 2.371532706265134
And he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.: 1.910065487212511
In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor.: 3.1404577970570253
Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.: 1.4630075701975833
So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I’m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don’t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.: 2.2923309663980236
—There’s one thing it hasn’t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.: 2.5529982158962246
—What’s that?: 3.1816935079248982
—The poor bugger’s tool that’s being hanged, says Alf.: 3.363672385936544
—That so?: 2.955133119377436
—God’s truth, says Alf.: 2.846865279645476
I heard that from the head warder that was in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible.: 2.4564320133825115
—That can be explained by science, says Bloom.: 1.9711162561396953
It’s only a natural phenomenon, don’t you see, because on account of the...: 3.2192988458415366
And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.: 2.0119415842762023
The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis._  So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other.: 2.197703981674306
Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought.: 2.185561579370945
Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs.: 1.6603665635268328
And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get.: 1.7567200993533387
So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:  —Give us the paw!: 1.9731971500671932
Give the paw, doggy!: 1.7782179598593266
Good old doggy!: 1.0973438282701218
Give the paw here!: 2.2774227878869073
Give us the paw!: 1.818504544305004
Arrah, bloody end to the paw he’d paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip.: 2.006318948968574
Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs’ tin he told Terry to bring.: 1.8989956555903693
Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more.: 2.671226318168596
Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.: 1.643175664503912
And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she’s far from the land.: 1.7547999273381392
And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face.: 3.142859897615759
Phenomenon!: 6.0235432912574565
The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.: 1.8068944671967173
Time they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk.: 2.3213953462907284
And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn’t near roast him, it’s a queer story, the old one, Bloom’s wife and Mrs O’Dowd that kept the hotel.: 2.2890268800027735
Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat.: 1.8693619348244694
And Bloom with his _but don’t you see?_ and _but on the other hand_.: 2.5388057209375163
And sure, more be token, the lout I’m told was in Power’s after, the blender’s, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment.: 2.209934872976223
Phenomenon!: 6.0235432912574565
—The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.: 3.0402812545248863
—Ay, ay, says Joe.: 3.4184958696514562
—You don’t grasp my point, says Bloom.: 2.1687158612263695
What I mean is...: 15.411593170282458
—_Sinn Fein!_ says the citizen.: 1.786519639112819
_Sinn Fein amhain!_ The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.: 1.8256035098110364
The last farewell was affecting in the extreme.: 1.347083880964788
From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance.: 1.6862970959460895
The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle.: 1.5044194833236932
A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons.: 1.9918757627030603
A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza’s plaintive muse.: 1.9217624781904017
Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents.: 1.475641117190797
Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual mirth-provoking fashion.: 1.5543729964721331
Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies.: 1.7425587129331752
The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day’s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat.: 1.9778738228476618
The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite.: 1.9202074159271796
The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed _doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y.: 2.594519333566653

All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness.: 1.7528815648524618
An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F.: 1.468175889173575
E.: 1.7201479306608167
I.: 7.3427091458448634
as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland’s patron saint.: 1.8679538494098333
In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged.: 2.0693045271103174
The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties.: 1.5757355352525646
The readywitted ninefooter’s suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted.: 2.0589086489783086
Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.: 1.5479240020419607
E.: 1.7201479306608167
I., several of whom were bleeding profusely.: 1.467799239561403
Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses.: 2.1958457366453925
The objects (which included several hundred ladies’ and gentlemen’s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.: 1.5639800401711703
Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus Cruentus_.: 2.076941433769517
He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate—short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man.: 1.6489347620719221
The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah_, amid which the ringing _evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable.: 2.0744822049737497
It was exactly seventeen o’clock.: 1.5918875381220428
The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication.: 1.5637231631454553
Hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously.: 2.2676826085682307
As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office.: 1.748695785143421
On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim.: 2.3217344568257974
The housesteward of the amalgamated cats’ and dogs’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution.: 2.289445269712375
Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers’ association as a token of his regard and esteem.: 1.7605888086650487
The _nec_ and _non plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake.: 1.6833694907977814
The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_.: 2.37453813501919
Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach.: 1.8616872670692457
She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park.: 1.9069626566767506
She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment.: 1.684967763808921
That monster audience simply rocked with delight.: 1.2711997973548779
But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time.: 1.682132687775739
A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself.: 1.9284489235977365
Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage.: 1.9123339521417178
A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot.: 1.9991310131484525
Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion’s history) placed on the finger of his blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds.: 1.9662741837424371
Nay, even the stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion.: 2.172385338047341
With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage,_ to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:  —God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart.: 2.0082183327506837
Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down Limehouse way.: 1.7705839119000453
So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland.: 2.248528805626847
Antitreating is about the size of it.: 2.061126889420225
Gob, he’d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you’d ever see the froth of his pint.: 1.971962310820094
And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don’t be talking.: 1.9776880029640242
And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of.: 1.6741020301035558
And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.: 1.88316573851358
So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me.: 2.3028070784017194
I’d train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog.: 2.5161196393222456
Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn’t blind him.: 2.379763364505172
—Afraid he’ll bite you?: 2.9124933914947664
says the citizen, jeering.: 9.931991353172295
—No, says I.: 6.272453186067437
But he might take my leg for a lamppost.: 2.158183583550146
So he calls the old dog over.: 2.211215650899429
Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.: 2.170848769696205
Such growling you never heard as they let off between them.: 1.5697834455704616
Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that.: 2.022056871156262
Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.: 2.8546160581889266
All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_ of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry.: 1.6280478606968813
The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse.: 2.1209599671307773
Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_ resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards.: 1.7414332712024927
We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D.: 1.7406423297753322
C.: 2.4776009465393525
points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye.: 2.48144897808958
We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication.: 1.601498482415838
The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught.: 1.9146650377625558
Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen’s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.: 1.4953965134132776
So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off.: 1.8908762994718713
And Joe asked him would he have another.: 2.872755434791688
—I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there’s no ill feeling.: 2.7140638748372328
Gob, he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking.: 3.4363109574160924
Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap’s dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators.: 1.6046086225993523
Entertainment for man and beast.: 1.4782142294317104
And says Joe:  —Could you make a hole in another pint?: 2.634154841166544
—Could a swim duck?: 5.523946538901188
—Same again, Terry, says Joe.: 1.7572303265783347
Are you sure you won’t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment?: 3.639051739460832
—Thank you, no, says Bloom.: 4.6930280286560855
As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don’t you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam’s.: 2.282692587499707
Martin asked me to go to the house.: 3.9774411273114594
You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn’t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the policy.: 3.2627169532838103
—Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old Shylock is landed.: 2.685568064680817
So the wife comes out top dog, what?: 2.1177324464258267
—Well, that’s a point, says Bloom, for the wife’s admirers.: 4.9777449918292485
—Whose admirers?: 1.6055867028663526
Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee’s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act.: 1.9609326851100575
He was bloody safe he wasn’t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court.: 2.0319445186081513
Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery.: 1.8244861676114705
True as you’re there.: 3.3448065167897805
O, commend me to an israelite!: 3.323820009017133
Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.: 1.5969830752443364
So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that’s dead to tell her.: 2.073623478769981
Choking with bloody foolery.: 1.4248936984562184
And shaking Bloom’s hand doing the tragic to tell her that.: 2.566150642628235
Shake hands, brother.: 1.70821731995142
You’re a rogue and I’m another.: 5.598334020600729
—Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour.: 1.9388200165984009
But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.: 1.852574256562795
—No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.: 1.914522717309294
—Then suffer me to take your hand, said he.: 2.226526058016302
The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.: 1.6102853893363975
And off with him and out trying to walk straight.: 2.318127198965817
Boosed at five o’clock.: 1.6998108816429611
Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, 14A.: 1.4907207797681787
Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups.: 1.9665087122861293
And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging.: 2.126079604255779
And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another.: 2.0805957792881085
_How is your testament?: 1.4304935282008857
Have you got an old testament?_ Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what.: 2.119131121846918
Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady.: 1.9714259475864664
Jack Mooney’s sister.: 3.1791509007179877
And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples.: 1.78252377570228
Gob, Jack made him toe the line.: 1.4944293978635153
Told him if he didn’t patch up the pot, Jesus, he’d kick the shite out of him.: 2.3816522896981
So Terry brought the three pints.: 2.979353817066419
—Here, says Joe, doing the honours.: 3.894052289266591
Here, citizen.: 11.807442718364987
—_Slan leat_, says he.: 2.8725825086759147
—Fortune, Joe, says I.: 1.9133525436629004
Good health, citizen.: 2.6984521960876418
Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already.: 2.961565658298892
Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.: 2.7260542751876984
—Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf?: 4.373789293780758
—Friend of yours, says Alf.: 2.695717954591811
—Nannan?: 3.2018725381323705
The mimber?: 22.035632567553517
—I won’t mention any names, says Alf.: 2.2039191612573004
—I thought so, says Joe.: 3.347529725481512
I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M.: 2.0743455785974807
—Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.: 2.0490662253297995
So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue.: 2.139242983543026
Walking about with his book and pencil here’s my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier.: 2.0783140105925657
Mister Knowall.: 1.6907479287571148
Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks.: 1.408403309334634
Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O’Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her.: 2.0261860009571357
Couldn’t loosen her farting strings but old cod’s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it.: 1.9168115953784077
What’s your programme today?: 5.134079290210357
Ay.: 5.360608849447323

Gob, he’d have a soft hand under a hen.: 2.5433897780633417

Gara.: 1.4060143567867762
Klook Klook Klook.: 1.8487811996393184

He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg.: 1.6244316377749266
Ga ga ga ga Gara.: 1.6548646783648349
Klook Klook Klook.: 1.8487811996393184
—Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.: 2.543408624953755
—Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going?: 3.2644309404841376
I wanted to see him, as it happens.: 6.534450659512196
—That’s too bad, says Bloom.: 3.3813778730652233
I wanted particularly.: 1.2504625571293357
Perhaps only Mr Field is going.: 1.4546522099408707
I couldn’t phone.: 3.7321863133517827
You’re sure?: 30.694687659142787
—Nannan’s going too, says Joe.: 2.436370879889464
The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park.: 1.63682231722011
What do you think of that, citizen?: 4.981674851348001
_The Sluagh na h-Eireann_.: 1.41071580942567
Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham.: 7.524142882032172
Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?: 1.786677624859021
Mr Allfours (Tamoshant.: 1.5233937217779132
Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house.: 1.6273365752215685
The answer to the honourable member’s question is in the affirmative.: 2.0065611592494976
Mr Orelli O’Reilly (Montenotte.: 2.736688933227914
Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?: 1.4860706795197793

The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides.: 2.3522582112065735

The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England’s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor.: 2.154099068351381
The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors’ book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.: 2.208745368208492

Ireland my nation says he (hoik!: 1.8779846914601854
phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there’s the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.: 2.072792548917635
So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries.: 2.04785856312294

And there’s the man now that’ll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.: 4.2272024304186155
Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general’s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king’s expense.: 2.173887360795524

You never saw the like of it in all your born puff.: 2.6191688344114508
Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he’d remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting.: 2.2321447346993724
The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses.: 1.6382110000843777
O, Jesus, he did.: 2.652911178816473
And he let a volley of oaths after him.: 2.1995171553569874
—Did I kill him, says he, or what?: 3.135036791564369
And he shouting to the bloody dog:  —After him, Garry!: 1.9335542132883312
After him, boy!: 3.204036556806061
Hundred to five!: 2.9665779981165215
Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.: 3.16153090358049
When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven.: 1.6825993651760536
And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him.: 1.8579534682803702
And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: _Elijah!: 1.9668472504466938
Elijah!_ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba!: 2.255272732652799
Adonai!_ And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe’s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.: 1.8544855391151034
[ 13 ]   The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace.: 1.5755753613355221
Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.: 2.098828755341089
The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly.: 1.7057472778827232
Many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name _H.: 1.7363485809615418
M.: 4.1967016971666
Belleisle_ printed on both.: 1.6856860347136189
For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them.: 1.5058747299280173
They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long.: 1.5507184422841367
And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight.: 1.760350672397022
He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words.: 2.0697231510974414
Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.: 2.1399486510502546
—Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said.: 2.687034690398116
Say out big, big.: 1.583361913811714
I want a drink of water.: 1.986086406371429
And baby prattled after her:  —A jink a jink a jawbo.: 2.077118829352305
Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on.: 1.6747291786077634
What a persuasive power that girl had!: 1.3659334724928076
But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib.: 2.3189537534860705
None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey.: 2.0506859394984627
A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme.: 2.2168014196198897
And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.: 1.7970486113235424
But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky.: 2.025514470777558
Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule.: 1.6537165948235075
The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had.: 2.076495091647554
But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman’s house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle too.: 1.5764589369651223
Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.: 2.58783472005228
—Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively.: 2.060560286034912
At once!: 10.50723365837251
And you, Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand.: 1.5636385134434136
Wait till I catch you for that.: 2.307125514095667
His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister’s word was law with the twins.: 1.4945343609727468
And in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure.: 2.1169898766943933
His little man-o’-war top and unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit.: 1.8822249419466917
—Nasty bold Jacky!: 1.4550858995044873
she cried.: 2.808757466112603
She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:  —What’s your name?: 3.3956261357000423
Butter and cream?: 35.07501185122003
—Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman.: 1.9194878564544267
Is Cissy your sweetheart?: 3.11797788481598
—Nao, tearful Tommy said.: 2.8854752589604455
—Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart?: 1.521621651248534
Cissy queried.: 12.262264875239923
—Nao, Tommy said.: 2.8555702177576308
—I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes.: 1.8953177313858791
I know who is Tommy’s sweetheart.: 1.8383450174762415
Gerty is Tommy’s sweetheart.: 1.607312955973283
—Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.: 2.063768560061066
Cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes.: 2.188507076626556
But who was Gerty?: 1.7969253032990826
Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see.: 1.5479062674009376
She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell.: 1.760784326820767
Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch’s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling.: 1.8872373887814842
The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid’s bow, Greekly perfect.: 2.203228647419983
Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either.: 1.8264582849027038
Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she’d never speak to her again.: 1.9740096715495539
There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.: 1.9362246360600266
Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her.: 1.7346734881336399
Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist.: 1.7767498819405056
Why have women such eyes of witchery?: 1.4668706183822715
Gerty’s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows.: 1.9946754297965619
Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive.: 1.9244910730750058
It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it.: 2.090864151590925
Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose?: 1.770768542011739
That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one.: 1.8025645169503424
But Gerty’s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair.: 1.5867043596563175
It was dark brown with a natural wave in it.: 1.6186618027389146
She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth.: 2.2497502805665723
And just now at Edy’s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God’s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.: 1.8262547773202995
For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes.: 1.7534648278867482
She was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.: 1.6960141180478328
The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning.: 2.1089788682011195
She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers’ quarrel.: 1.7612226121111818
As per usual somebody’s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window.: 2.0109726388200384
Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W.: 1.936070110088626
E.: 1.7201479306608167
Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university.: 1.4523606200833352
Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core.: 1.5348537132795788
Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time.: 1.7292233017897105
They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph.: 1.7603169685809097
But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.: 2.1433336079131156
Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out.: 2.661286782886273
A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected in the _Lady’s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection.: 1.728819820078372
She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone.: 2.050562587516135
All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery’s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny.: 1.625330981807676
She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her!: 1.6439812450106224
And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew.: 2.7260148538100344
Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep.: 1.658488435480219
Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops.: 1.6532287863692379
As for undies they were Gerty’s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her?: 1.7218625379807673
She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn’t trust those washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching the things.: 2.1413049768080334
She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn’t of a Friday.: 1.8678507441851955
And yet and yet!: 1.6201074334423216
That strained look on her face!: 2.1423193598314967
A gnawing sorrow is there all the time.: 1.859959955774288
Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror.: 2.3451706103425307
You are lovely, Gerty, it said.: 1.8601384198239406
The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful.: 1.6332752832778423
Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.: 1.2997420960136188
Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.: 2.3141278533962932
C.: 2.4776009465393525
D.: 3.8019539057396092
(because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be.: 1.7233140518013612
He was too young to understand.: 2.2790479732032476
The night of the party long ago in Stoer’s (he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips.: 1.9180162867418247
He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments.: 2.004281784804031
Impetuous fellow!: 1.7277835936720194
Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie’s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men.: 1.6512652798258778
No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss.: 1.8048662125429618
It would be like heaven.: 3.278926121485669
For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve.: 1.406180698163279
With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.: 2.003136532375102
And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be.: 1.718852927503452
Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in November.: 1.980184352506697
She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess.: 1.534129952872857
Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn’t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap’s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery’s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses.: 1.7870758397406432
He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.: 1.7534460720563045
Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight.: 1.9876256860612012
But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please.: 2.2128097470977783
The temper of him!: 1.685772883879991
O, he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies.: 2.902967524597332
Edy told him no, no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.: 2.696227986808048
—You’re not my sister, naughty Tommy said.: 2.231138487895812
It’s my ball.: 8.786207259252233
But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.: 1.7820101960902397
—Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.: 1.8321266101621765
And she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played here’s the lord mayor, here’s his two horses, here’s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin.: 2.1067222805399832
But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him.: 1.7679028900262872
—I’d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won’t say.: 3.4721185116110047
—On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.: 3.9408710139319734
Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said.: 2.2581790478562067
But not a pin cared Ciss.: 1.46046912493728
she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose.: 2.2798029038182186
Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I’d look at him.: 3.38029120190769
For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White.: 1.898398852158139
That was just like Cissycums.: 2.29925963120788
O, and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette.: 1.8834333505549554
There was none to come up to her for fun.: 1.8876921962028719
But she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.: 1.9464773759079592
And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ.: 2.2521457809145105
It was the men’s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S.: 2.9331994340936016
J., rosary, sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament.: 1.681036664049406
They were there gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins.: 2.1761450654437975
How sad to poor Gerty’s ears!: 1.8466830531432714
Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson’s Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none.: 1.6547808328209965
But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days.: 1.4187039609282244
Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.: 2.1691674643482006
And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful, Virgin most merciful.: 1.4208546798682449
And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk.: 1.7777457533138246
You never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose.: 2.155518089038448
Poor father!: 1.7841397191389132
With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby’s salad dressing for supper and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke.: 1.9220458125234738
Her mother’s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken.: 1.6772539792847387
No-one would have thought the end was so near.: 2.252609340462406
Now he was laid to rest.: 1.5175850843195269
And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby’s cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home.: 2.1185276251447926
A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold.: 2.1272387663341346
And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn’t like her mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff.: 2.0015170022536926
Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways.: 1.7703811120972242
It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window.: 2.0934683572293196
You could see there was a story behind it.: 2.204781166594737
The colours were done something lovely.: 1.2672277422738512
She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat.: 1.7817979517890565
The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks.: 1.7270728272104339
Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball.: 1.8252997126278983
Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please.: 1.8004746410693182
The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the rock.: 1.6992732276732037
The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.: 1.917633134997071
Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip.: 1.2502147441774287
A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle.: 1.7432838628302048
Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking.: 2.2313711579672666
She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks.: 1.9349788709254383
Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose.: 1.8444838179137992
And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin’s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.: 1.809946584547844
The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers.: 1.371323559396359
Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air.: 1.448580432228286
Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah!: 1.6937783385628373
and, my word, didn’t the little chap enjoy that!: 2.1772175713495345
And then she told him to say papa.: 4.038299542225385
—Say papa, baby.: 1.8787337666847939
Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.: 1.8483612107139324
And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something great, they said.: 2.096639837770658
—Haja ja ja haja.: 1.2562220799205688
Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him.: 1.6984517958571925
Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:  —Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.: 2.128421277338177
And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks.: 1.407784409393593
It was all no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased.: 2.4910056917833776
Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats of twins.: 2.0681062722391927
She gazed out towards the distant sea.: 1.7901466388317717
It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft.: 2.159644249221799
And while she gazed her heart went pitapat.: 1.4820595534503678
Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his look.: 2.92856821416813
His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul.: 1.6262895827446038
Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust them?: 1.7623425999592996
She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn’t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he was sitting.: 2.246172359944674
He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face.: 2.4493690378521844
She would have given worlds to know what it was.: 2.7115481529402716
He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down.: 2.010815909328322
She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away.: 1.8664961712917114
Here was that of which she had so often dreamed.: 2.1920253593257755
It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else.: 2.2857411217551338
The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him.: 2.911539927515476
If he had suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not.: 2.005431904845513
Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her.: 1.8270889792307432
There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm.: 1.3669395176743064
She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the past.: 2.016111605247217
Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for herself alone.: 2.6903613341296033
Refuge of sinners.: 1.7443462855480456
Comfortress of the afflicted.: 6.855034295747587
_Ora pro nobis_.: 2.0908451234319414
Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart.: 1.6864444363942945
Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin’s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O’Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down.: 1.9233573238057091
He told her that time when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word.: 2.372435043253052
He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.: 1.9627490738973548
The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it.: 1.8104516530974644
Little monkeys common as ditchwater.: 1.4120583125997124
Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them.: 1.9462026809208641
And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.: 2.0688151420575607
—Jacky!: 5.258815040740064
Tommy!: 6.8023245137479815
Not they!: 1.7683794512978865
What a great notion they had!: 1.5241898637259947
So Cissy said it was the very last time she’d ever bring them out.: 2.8862529190511736
She jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow long because it wasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it.: 2.00709580381121
She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible.: 2.3896469838075056
It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble.: 1.7011813317967333
_Tableau!_ That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness.: 2.6592555846746673
Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O’Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O’Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_.: 2.1310899708516717
Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow’s of George’s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there wasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself.: 2.032424044721979
Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature.: 1.8407709854168057
Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl’s shoulders—a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness.: 2.001990776188868
You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that.: 1.8862507529939834
She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve.: 1.7412574829513383
She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes.: 1.8377927750154992
He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey.: 1.5076104644569137
Her woman’s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.: 1.9081601998252424
Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby.: 1.8933311477063324
Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers.: 2.1755209790984837
And she said to Gerty:  —A penny for your thoughts.: 3.036146319540292
—What?: 9.840555452504102
replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth.: 2.4190663415666562
I was only wondering was it late.: 1.7497543746588455
Because she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late.: 1.9678701503004976
And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss again.: 2.0502175975346972
But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.: 2.917029241802623
—Wait, said Cissy, I’ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what’s the time by his conundrum.: 2.595797934952214
So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his watchchain, looking up at the church.: 2.110289060188105
Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself.: 2.373426356823584
One moment he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.: 2.095273047360751
Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set.: 2.102157175558665
Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order.: 1.7262873256605549
Then they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O’Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time.: 1.9892919111980252
It was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets.: 2.6679958290056955
She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon.: 1.9911568823419497
His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine.: 1.9285081439885388
If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man’s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man’s face.: 2.3359994191883566
It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.: 2.7122674037849808
Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O’Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti eis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over.: 2.0893657977252347
Gerty winced sharply.: 1.2321206436677568
A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable.: 1.4126059919546228
It hurt—O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was.: 1.861615464156443
She had loved him better than he knew.: 2.142119073795164
Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears.: 2.26500038525787
Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.: 2.2913220840096487
—O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head flashed up.: 2.2919015121037103
I can throw my cap at who I like because it’s leap year.: 1.7967049949371505
Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the ringdove, but they cut the silence icily.: 2.2824532643201354
There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with.: 2.222724775292616
As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces.: 1.8795886155026638
And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot.: 1.891648675979609
Miss puny little Edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.: 1.9144623746016687
Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior.: 1.9988546157049027
And Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.: 1.9605292422649658
—O my!: 3.138215603686079
Puddeny pie!: 1.6516338886173054
protested Ciss.: 1.3003038758932586
He has his bib destroyed.: 1.6713520630317882
The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights.: 1.4390660959488273
Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O’Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands.: 1.8960222748478706
How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry.: 1.9766654659219238
And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss Cummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales.: 1.897614036160715
For Gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of.: 1.92757235946938
She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean.: 1.9343782554291924
It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely’s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs.: 1.7668551921185474
_Art thou real, my ideal?_ it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt thou ever?_ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.: 1.9545436617125516
But it must end, she felt.: 1.6410750567865382
If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her.: 1.9387899635933383
Love laughs at locksmiths.: 1.4669385340430914
She would make the great sacrifice.: 1.6073851422051921
Her every effort would be to share his thoughts.: 1.4217936870135663
Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness.: 2.265144120402415
There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind.: 1.9603884914158647
But even if—what then?: 1.5822306052270163
Would it make a very great difference?: 1.9046553864155569
From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled.: 2.6242205739452444
No, no: not that.: 3.2697650740233115
They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess.: 2.1448052908136246
Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall.: 2.2128064230243427
She thought she understood.: 2.093298651770122
She would try to understand him because men were so different.: 1.5179724355060225
The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes.: 1.5625305391900566
Heart of mine!: 1.788717046283902
She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide.: 2.233710451358812
Nothing else mattered.: 1.1719544252990588
Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free.: 2.536544826076295
Canon O’Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn’t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:  —O, look, Cissy!: 2.295665060853582
And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.: 2.0439501664884134
—It’s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.: 2.282299121637316
And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church, helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running.: 2.2384945295480554
—Come on, Gerty, Cissy called.: 2.812756585599619
It’s the bazaar fireworks.: 5.10194853692927
But Gerty was adamant.: 1.6785294287226318
She had no intention of being at their beck and call.: 1.6284317783132296
If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was.: 1.939972598246006
The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling.: 1.8454230645519192
She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her.: 2.0516191312303276
Whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave, and it had made her his.: 1.9264391202273956
At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips.: 2.1322871889518153
She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed.: 1.934467306133116
But this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips.: 1.8664449176877265
Besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did.: 1.9636484482568617
And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark.: 2.3077789943024376
And she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking.: 2.1428641960948065
And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O!: 1.464061475633912
then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O!: 2.245570291577031
and everyone cried O!: 1.2829140583047098
in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah!: 2.0251790520364854
they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft!: 1.7439345930175252
Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent.: 2.5379286234027103
Ah!: 4.213168971631986
She glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl.: 1.9147166523384256
He was leaning back against the rock behind.: 1.4946961077980458
Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes.: 1.771507349741506
What a brute he had been!: 2.417569770446567
At it again?: 3.155595883296198
A fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered?: 2.419625986126055
An utter cad he had been!: 2.3033573196598307
He of all men!: 1.8199447631940198
But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered.: 1.821376984025208
Should a girl tell?: 1.5354907145124062
No, a thousand times no.: 1.5169990909473123
That was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don’t tell.: 1.9358008773299136
Gerty!: 6.837190906988567
We’re going.: 6.783947073659145
Come on.: 7.471163597674674

Gerty had an idea, one of love’s little ruses.: 2.4689172874869043

She drew herself up to her full height.: 1.8314211218417513
Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face.: 1.8957057937977773
She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.: 2.447058339112582
Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman.: 1.7667699847559868
It was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed.: 1.7540996864407215

Universally that person’s acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind’s ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent nature’s incorrupted benefaction.: 1.656155305860333
For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature’s boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution’s menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?: 1.8165276726868635

The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed.: 1.8607382840992914
The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be.: 1.9391843356245555

Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.: 1.4261698784269696
And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat.: 1.942834516351543
And there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon.: 1.5829030010402967
And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice.: 2.0662895641718135
And he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there.: 2.0444017353001107
And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile.: 3.345773317931248
Also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility.: 2.2570728982712653
But the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle.: 1.9787636097354087
And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery.: 1.705459932737732
And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment.: 2.9276960855899024
And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously.: 2.157584846769132
And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles.: 2.970676931644503
And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer.: 1.5651867815926326
And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so.: 1.7352925991967516
And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress.: 2.1491396062247983
And also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain.: 2.3181952406325714
And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.: 2.125605065332454
And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each.: 1.4659695686199177
And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile.: 1.705160722394612
And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile.: 2.1596653955797604
Thanked be Almighty God.: 1.2407068409934616
This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast.: 1.8258096749787058
Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be not come or now.: 2.0087720387789907
Meseems it dureth overlong.: 2.415995489432173
And he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently.: 2.210261968352353
But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long.: 1.8183687032001759
And the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next.: 1.521998956853533
Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both’s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness.: 2.1736178539681954
And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup.: 2.3954764992920867
Woman’s woe with wonder pondering.: 2.862283788081546
Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might.: 2.0617575918046294
There was a sort of scholars along either side the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable’s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir Leopold.: 2.056929333980786
But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow.: 1.625192993528418
And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner.: 2.079043962841507
Ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.: 1.5064371150440494
For they were right witty scholars.: 1.3819994761789043
And he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne’s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case).: 1.9734032238486172
And they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die.: 1.7571372111395982
And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy.: 1.5494944791549514
A redress God grant.: 2.0961004639311134
This was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live and the babe to die.: 1.5978332333067558
In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack.: 1.4474992105708702
Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved.: 1.913217696962205
To whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk.: 1.4265118137672528
Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire.: 1.9382503637657897
But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life?: 2.32550610162453
For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief.: 2.2537577502250663
We are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we.: 1.3727410073362976
Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends.: 1.483105997790833
But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead.: 2.109894475665021
Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi’s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do.: 1.852316500032114
Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever.: 1.9730372428527252
Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses Maimonides.: 2.3946355636050334
He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman’s seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded.: 1.932342060905384
All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life.: 1.5102527424388075
A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions.: 1.975783403824143
That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word.: 2.4239453414189542
Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.: 1.8960159397562766
But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny.: 1.7348422314755652
And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb’s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores.: 1.8190421445492968
About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray.: 1.541819293886933
Now drink we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul’s bodiment.: 1.8091664009651287

Be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay.: 1.6866220215741574
See ye here.: 1.2138945295801498
And he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ.: 2.03382997445502
They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore.: 2.1519546588209737
His words were then these as followeth: Know all men, he said, time’s ruins build eternity’s mansions.: 1.9919632544432564
What means this?: 1.2722835422299004

Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack: _The first three months she was not well, Staboo,_ when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard.: 1.7302829558170192
It was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising also the time’s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred.: 2.152967679016789
In Horne’s house rest should reign.: 2.1510722932259863
To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days.: 1.9777056569537876
Master Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership.: 2.302074269553462
But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin.: 1.958314328565381
Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was there unmaided.: 2.6769274415321123
He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is in their _Maid’s Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers: _To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals.: 2.383291559369894
An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion.: 3.187967196379298
Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed, but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come.: 2.5275126354486
Young Stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it.: 1.980475890166049
Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend.: 2.076729037220805

Look forth now, my people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo and from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with milk and money.: 2.422352038517326

And thou hast left me alone for ever in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast thou kissed my mouth.: 1.8668238788684222
This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to say, hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much as mentioned for the Orient from on high which brake hell’s gates visited a darkness that was foraneous.: 2.1172602843166937

The aged sisters draw us into life: we wail, batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over us dead they bend.: 1.8103306634448273
First, saved from waters of old Nile, among bulrushes, a bed of fasciated wattles: at last the cavity of a mountain, an occulted sepulchre amid the conclamation of the hillcat and the ossifrage.: 2.1032688604381526
And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or to Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see from what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness.: 1.829457165206251
Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _Etienne chanson_ but he loudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea.: 2.0287544911872835
Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack      See the malt stored in many a refluent sack,      In the proud cirque of Jackjohn’s bivouac.: 2.0913078941562966

Loud on left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler.: 1.4726256200719834
Came now the storm that hist his heart.: 1.4319353543091278
And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry.: 2.9492345424244224
And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm.: 1.9167272335689018
Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour.: 1.71269139144637
But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead.: 1.8871467176492698
But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne’s hall.: 2.3460633362968504
He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart’s side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon.: 1.8319926821108348
But was young Boasthard’s fear vanquished by Calmer’s words?: 1.7314382262272259
No, for he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be done away.: 1.8722877093488715
And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other?: 1.7703502780119182
He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either.: 2.2066166159484415
But could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle Holiness that then he lived withal?: 1.635638771550981
Indeed no for Grace was not there to find that bottle.: 1.591349323536225
Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon?: 1.9482891726365807
Heard?: 6.7868607478111596
Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding (which he had not done).: 2.19236529492832
For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show.: 2.503921021453224
And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away?: 1.9295635669417057
By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law.: 1.5713565648023609
Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it?: 1.79868481811507
Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two-in-the-Bush or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence.: 2.183372531146006
This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird-in-the-Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her.: 1.737721425333095
For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, Two-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild.: 1.9004784082561432
So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon, Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer.: 1.7918689467866793
Wherein, O wretched company, were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.: 2.3269066348947574
So Thursday sixteenth June Patk.: 1.2135196549956038
Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won’t sprout, fields athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.: 2.3225994553473908
Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without.: 1.942197599808026
The rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire.: 1.509014714576969

In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke’s lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no more crack after that first.: 1.7649477722725067

Mulligan a gentleman’s gentleman that had but come from Mr Moore’s the writer’s (that was a papish but is now, folk say, a good Williamite) chanced against Alec.: 2.268320665880082
Bannon in a cut bob (which are now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M’s brother will stay a month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there, he bound home and he to Andrew Horne’s being stayed for to crush a cup of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and so both together on to Horne’s.: 1.84030296981909
There Leop.: 1.2025720567418605

Lenehan, very sad about a racer he fancied and Stephen D.: 1.9885610937874787
Leop.: 1.5080636023718699
Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put to it and can’t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her soon issue.: 1.9037745515566296
’Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and Lady day bit off her last chick’s nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the king’s bible.: 1.9660550967247477
Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag, I hear.: 1.7901713338140541
In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi’s almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer’s gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how.: 1.9315406643828945
With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on Stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk.: 2.0436238622629537
He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat.: 2.1440365838860207
To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul’s men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip.: 2.391087966882474
He took his ordinary at a boilingcook’s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother’s son of them would burst their sides.: 2.3673276852932776
The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale.: 1.857428938151707
Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), ’tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague.: 2.1694436188418
But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it.: 1.963050429775145
There’s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset.: 2.4153534223508712
_Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too.: 3.5039217731797874
From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes.: 2.1555079292729085
One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire’s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge.: 2.2663284066465597
He had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him.: 1.7408951062881883
What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter all?: 2.1641381249831415
I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he.: 1.7843812973774948
I can scarce believe ’tis so bad, says he.: 1.6440839512269736
And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low’s yard in Prussia street.: 1.7350079788827883
I question with you there, says he.: 1.9738048772276842
More like ’tis the hoose or the timber tongue.: 1.4755442668018766
Mr Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns.: 2.634032118335134
Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing.: 2.0373795959462035
He’ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that’s Irish, says he.: 2.8835396716532893
Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop.: 1.882515547377296
I conceive you, says Mr Dixon.: 3.0923602226236047
It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose.: 1.9307010387980104
True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock.: 3.0611722720279615
He had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.: 2.289276245330018
What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself.: 1.8360118826406266
So be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly.: 2.0183533218202157
But the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland.: 2.0272464595472983
Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart’s content.: 2.169515768273889
By this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture.: 1.8590939293126112
Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground.: 2.0866464492754195
And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry’s orders.: 2.2591446876120336
There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I’ll meddle in his matters, says he.: 2.766078809556795
I’ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me.: 2.646215754179388
But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for boss of the show.: 2.116193590243968
After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a cow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name.: 2.468202605900411
Then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat.: 2.088577862935205
In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt.: 1.6335068241211803
They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America.: 2.1715220663179293
Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty:  _—Pope Peter’s but a pissabed.: 2.5485670512455565
A man’s a man for a’ that._  Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars.: 2.2844333588186716
Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on.: 1.847550930772621
Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell’s bearing a legend printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan.: 1.8807897649482739
Fertiliser and Incubator.: 9.154444478594739
Lambay Island_.: 1.6907479287571148
His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed.: 2.372125920027711
Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon.: 2.686305658596135
I make no doubt it smacks of wenching.: 2.1713876833615666
Come, be seated, both.: 2.9847019062692484
’Tis as cheap sitting as standing.: 1.3553711741339656
Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired.: 2.0570507799928817
It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep.: 2.5487161877523286
To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party.: 1.7449065446209648
He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural.: 1.6756679561229815
Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains.: 2.369421055182193
The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man.: 2.4989653907792024
For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies.: 1.7698424133639536
After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it.: 1.9765814592052062
They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr Mulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald.: 2.488237040186181
His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary’s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle.: 1.9617103820091777
Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck.: 2.7546602388418475
Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced.: 2.0547557378418047
The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour.: 2.103359526011587
Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional assistance we could give?: 1.8598845502033783
Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne’s house, that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman’s woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place.: 1.927447150956469
Mr Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due, as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach.: 2.5775833394519183
For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though ’tis pity she’s a trollop): There’s a belly that never bore a bastard.: 2.3675492941986045
This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight.: 1.6961466359354116
The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber.: 2.7208755352667353
Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it.: 1.9491946202169361
_Mais bien sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_.: 1.9591129117917898
That you may and very opportunely.: 1.6866267693038617
There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity.: 1.4456970355642473
But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things.: 1.934128608752206
With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.: 1.9094540112991043
Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, ’pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever.: 1.7840926861400637
I declare, I was never so touched in all my life.: 2.0066883026789046
God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days!: 2.527282791210397
Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours.: 1.3648561563334352
A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.: 1.7456746029145518
Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years.: 2.072774282032918
But indeed, sir, I wander from the point.: 2.2707094842408555
How mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys.: 1.3656134732446665
Maledicity!: 8.936658005791672
he exclaimed in anguish.: 1.619245657129003
Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along!: 1.6145965601207244
I could weep to think of it.: 2.2734375140227745
Then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse.: 1.6083619501764512
But beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting.: 2.423919461994671
Tut, tut!: 1.1781457647548947
cries Le Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak.: 1.966406322405726
A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans blague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world.: 2.258960376328629
Pooh!: 2.0898687147847532
A _livre!_ cries Monsieur Lynch.: 3.132064390077132
The clumsy things are dear at a sou.: 1.648246820287756
One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps.: 1.5421805885788733
No woman of any wit would wear one.: 1.4207231054672629
My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment.: 1.7094763105913524
The first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath...: 1.9769980505461087
But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge.: 1.9296052574393507
Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound bow to the company.: 1.9675372786682837
The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry.: 2.0000633848015665
Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.: 1.631172030940471
A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh!: 1.7781367498611569
I’ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you.: 2.8382378349081754
What, you dog?: 2.9320587669450413
Have you a way with them?: 2.5130057762259215
Gad’s bud, immensely so, said Mr Lynch.: 1.6563919840318813
The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater hospice.: 1.7891769783034277
Demme, does not Doctor O’Gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin.: 1.8834610034694763
As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months.: 1.7682854131905104
Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body!: 1.783881183988766
Drat the man!: 1.8396853846505066
Bless me, I’m all of a wibbly wobbly.: 3.8189292111848343
Why, you’re as bad as dear little Father Cantekissem, that you are!: 2.9567133794400764
May this pot of four half choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way.: 1.5940655809158106
I knows a lady what’s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her.: 2.135823710734245
The young surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward.: 1.8253848429628707
Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy.: 2.2240121176697367
I want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth.: 1.9379676993774282
I am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast.: 2.0862630674154095
Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours?: 1.873606988057381
And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay?: 1.9215467857807975
Perish the thought!: 1.6791101376756594
I shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne.: 1.9050943091321126
Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door.: 1.5417216218694985
A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath.: 1.9283741858913601
Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart.: 1.7326209371807841
To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity.: 2.0544204052439023
The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf.: 2.3191520451497203
But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation’s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin.: 2.2190245295801154
It was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable.: 1.9484264514103047
To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat.: 1.8155482503608078
Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions.: 2.0385058510446643
To conclude, while from the sister’s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being.: 2.003907918551625
Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers.: 1.9674925716318838
I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her.: 2.1033930015383753
I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon.: 2.620431879623845
’Slife, I’ll be round with you.: 5.030339727158183
I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her.: 1.7282812007457504
All fell to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household.: 1.8032357601901408
Singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest.: 2.440999851990895
But, he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.: 1.6930562075158138
But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity?: 1.985098372979506
Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled?: 1.5217869908967345
During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents?: 1.637641058098434
Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received?: 1.4568796151021512
Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer?: 2.378796567871064
Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so.: 1.7797803555539913
Unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate.: 2.1405559467175825
He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society!: 2.439566847829476
In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe’s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic.: 1.5957125780592882
It ill becomes him to preach that gospel.: 1.3577064252544337
A habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life.: 1.6646414644652527
If he must dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him.: 1.900983591562964
His marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce.: 1.3317786467051727
The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative.: 1.764006675193913
The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born.: 1.7169084562417223
When he had betaken himself to the women’s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues.: 2.1393872518605126
In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain.: 2.301327416549151
The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent.: 1.6355443737440665
Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king’s bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers _Sturzgeburt,_ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents—in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations.: 2.3612277111715962
The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation.: 1.9931318739420871
The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro’s inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a _prima facie_ and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel Steevens was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born.: 1.9164788877822903
The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human.: 1.5642717887788002
An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses.: 1.7441818951291543
The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived.: 1.4917979609751761
It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man.: 1.9583394979576532
Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus.: 1.7293684237584483
Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.: 1.8488005029127892
But Malachias’ tale began to freeze them with horror.: 1.4091720091702198

Which of us did not feel his flesh creep!: 1.5162752010839597
He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a phial marked _Poison._ Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin.: 2.159521096053243
I anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history is to blame.: 2.078095436790426
Yes, it is true.: 3.285292570343915

This is the appearance is on me.: 2.4065701614287307
Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus?: 2.2068028219140605
My hell, and Ireland’s, is in this life.: 3.029307255665893
It is what I tried to obliterate my crime.: 1.7023907867052364
Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping out.: 2.1613746629500947
In vain!: 6.297381939437634
His spectre stalks me.: 1.2314606708753608
Dope is my only hope...: 1.4292399677884502
Ah!: 4.213168971631986
Destruction!: 3.7014331688252864
The black panther!: 2.7054466162719644
With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back.: 1.5310940207813983
An instant later his head appeared in the door opposite and said: Meet me at Westland Row station at ten past eleven.: 1.8192858590813794
He was gone.: 2.2352733780052554
The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun!: 2.4669517646740227
The sage repeated: _Lex talionis_.: 1.2342783274412783
The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done.: 1.261451023664168
Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased.: 1.2844638582405596
The mystery was unveiled.: 1.2264245856423364
Haines was the third brother.: 2.0090814683162876
His real name was Childs.: 1.8082938826222617
The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father.: 2.160286474091153
He drank drugs to obliterate.: 1.2954225246821176
For this relief much thanks.: 1.0938502966257657
The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited.: 1.4230451415699654
No soul will live there.: 1.266993448695593
The spider pitches her web in the solitude.: 1.5601383294182856
The nocturnal rat peers from his hole.: 1.356660550044545
A curse is on it.: 1.5785339298505685
It is haunted.: 3.014223395503428
Murderer’s ground.: 1.6212497775993606
What is the age of the soul of man?: 2.9409395202329023
As she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood.: 1.586389453896805
No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds.: 1.6668196741007348
A score of years are blown away.: 1.9362507855477393
He is young Leopold.: 1.2613194672583454
There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself.: 1.8574105551587987
That young figure of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother’s thought.: 2.330701323932853
Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas!: 2.08167560591093
a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart?: 2.259979484357892
tell me!) his studied baisemoins.: 1.2563127165351966
The scent, the smile, but, more than these, the dark eyes and oleaginous address, brought home at duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm, seated with Jacob’s pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you may be sure, is aheating), reading through round horned spectacles some paper from the Europe of a month before.: 1.894026877605304
But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist.: 2.235407684841671
Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons.: 1.6553559726444218
Who can say?: 1.6158638725933314
The wise father knows his own child.: 1.5833905992328157
He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the first.: 2.7778241234930676
Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university.: 1.961210742888581
Bridie!: 3.7014331688252864
Bridie Kelly!: 2.7909799075659527

In a breath ’twas done but—hold!: 1.3736827863983352
Back!: 7.204174316185146
It must not be!: 1.5070300784129806
She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night.: 1.8312187340984052
She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day.: 1.4899544427828244
No, Leopold.: 2.88304586972246
Name and memory solace thee not.: 1.3496309647804339

No son of thy loins is by thee.: 1.4771090496073804
There is none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.: 1.5934535227655542
The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived.: 1.657880260552674
A region where grey twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars.: 1.8581824559958293
She follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal.: 1.43838242271474
Twilight phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull.: 1.4405791793638125
They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone.: 1.6407101839664815
Netaim, the golden, is no more.: 1.8228908954909995
And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of beasts.: 1.6367788685880604
Huuh!: 1.5499895895457867
Hark!: 1.9224646050599292
Huuh!: 1.5499895895457867
Parallax stalks behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions.: 2.3381572318151482
Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_.: 3.7127441181381546
Ominous revengeful zodiacal host!: 1.2215972388043366
They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.: 3.7920386817064164
Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood.: 2.446534086297039
And the equine portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven’s own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo.: 1.9592848272657495
And lo, wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin.: 2.438112125775183
It is she, Martha, thou lost one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant.: 1.959122139713923
How serene does she now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer.: 2.3350197173437084
It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of Taurus.: 1.5977533754966549
Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at school together in Conmee’s time.: 1.8873242426760408
He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades, Pisistratus.: 3.1093305217374416
Where were they now?: 1.512630945601724
You have spoken of the past and its phantoms, Stephen said.: 2.0341026627999983
Why think of them?: 2.4915156536625616
If I call them into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call?: 1.7737911833596236
Who supposes it?: 3.4824838966264324
I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life.: 1.437053006023151
He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent.: 4.620361359991639
That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father.: 1.8817552663982506
All who wish you well hope this for you.: 1.4024610703320082
I heartily wish you may not fail them.: 1.484720933507826
O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him.: 2.0730944052649076
Have no fear.: 1.553254458250338
He could not leave his mother an orphan.: 2.2499043424522256
All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss.: 2.039837303274755
He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart.: 1.76577683594179
Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider’s name: Lenehan as much more.: 2.2629263846956493
He told them of the race.: 1.6333501538336561
The flag fell and, huuh!: 1.6505323047305052
off, scamper, the mare ran out freshly with O.: 2.6151285170270318
Madden up.: 1.363928801958755
She was leading the field.: 1.3627124176299916
All hearts were beating.: 1.479095279813958
Even Phyllis could not contain herself.: 1.4385252522071679
She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah!: 1.8021989914693446
Sceptre wins!: 1.5245851279544358
But in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her.: 1.8266208766420056
All was lost now.: 1.4328900788521646
Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones.: 1.9024476841829674
Juno, she cried, I am undone.: 2.989644375597941
But her lover consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook.: 1.5782051673256177
A tear fell: one only.: 1.43569449079198
A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W.: 1.6330546448971566
Lane.: 3.728945875646809
Four winners yesterday and three today.: 1.4009448113657936
What rider is like him?: 1.570078845344396
Mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his.: 2.9787831829681353
But let us bear it as was the ancient wont.: 1.6024829777261898
Mercy on the luckless!: 1.4922688875438577
Poor Sceptre!: 1.685158060262481
he said with a light sigh.: 2.7207497272740855
She is not the filly that she was.: 2.5766164340063615
Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another.: 1.681632318762294
By gad, sir, a queen of them.: 2.766243833885614
Do you remember her, Vincent?: 2.4743749254062597
I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent said.: 1.7050121430702099
How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of it.: 1.7299418846290908
The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us.: 2.050955570491129
In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge.: 1.6026355730177126
But she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which I held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I pressed too close.: 1.814766540690524
A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril.: 1.4131865517592201
She is more taking then.: 1.344157580236782
Her posies too!: 1.8291883206343431
Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together.: 2.0392077342028805
And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field.: 2.050188904232269
Conmee himself!: 1.7439563460333785
He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page.: 1.9970269778057135
The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her.: 1.6638866028656527
When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries.: 1.6468309439643254
But he had been kind.: 4.431919816454986
In going by he had blessed us.: 1.6363880639241835
The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said.: 1.4817618029004376
If I had poor luck with Bass’s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely.: 1.691360285184043
He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.: 2.0474505392091715
Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence.: 1.3114130863076152
His soul is far away.: 1.644168067771027
Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods.: 1.7113337627301406
Do you not think it, Stephen?: 2.943575328483776
Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law.: 2.2976379851032815
The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation.: 2.2884155440464204
However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at all.: 3.0328682392843094
The individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop.: 1.6106496780904127
During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone’s remark on account of its scarlet appearance.: 1.8622357793689963
He was simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment before’s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn.: 1.9184947090801086
Eventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.: 2.0890044036085818
The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life.: 2.1717238608777074
Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity.: 1.2463081474383622
The debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital.: 2.6109155673448132
The high hall of Horne’s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic.: 1.831720757687286
A gallant scene in truth it made.: 1.3632341467744606
Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway.: 1.9009399788257437
There too, opposite to him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom.: 2.0526169807400514
Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden.: 1.8399367839240863
The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer’s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan.: 1.5838800061456366
Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.: 1.923462186065873
It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S.: 1.8784079173799437
Dedalus’ (Div.: 1.1229898361838873
Scep.) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods.: 1.36391356571441
Science, it cannot be too often repeated, deals with tangible phenomena.: 2.3173186531184435
The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can.: 1.7333888642084674
There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer—at present—such as the first problem submitted by Mr L.: 1.810160357596764
Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex.: 1.4482106568165227
Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both?: 2.6176574587918666
This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature’s favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus felix_, of the passive element.: 3.2662354943502825
The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality.: 1.536322084099208
It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways.: 2.3366320402842167
Mr M.: 1.615140503236801
Mulligan (Hyg.: 1.8391904412214837
et Eug.: 4.481021986909756
Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc.: 1.855903063695034
by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust.: 1.2359477111126373
These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas—these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race.: 2.0727755709992564
Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner.: 1.9582187224044336
Mr J.: 1.2848102437933555
Crotthers (Disc.: 1.2321206436677568
Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide.: 1.6174095061830536
Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative.: 1.8675314863436159
In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions.: 2.0651886007138365
An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V.: 1.4224669495054845
Lynch (Bacc.: 1.1719544252990588
Arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature’s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained.: 1.776630564253501
Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet’s words, give us pause.: 1.9058902884389735
Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest.: 1.6906326058484686
Mr S.: 1.7574490506641995
Dedalus’ (Div.: 1.1229898361838873
Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to.: 2.0871981793022094
For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother.: 2.117163930183661
In a recent public controversy with Mr L.: 1.6476965536936263
Canv.) which took place in the commons’ hall of the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A.: 1.6086083839732395

I.) is the able and popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete’s allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of all nature’s processes—the act of sexual congress) she must let it out again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own.: 1.8868286923056536
At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.: 2.3417585036073683
Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy _accouchement._ It had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor.: 1.8982093956782555

Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband.: 2.069990874490973
And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God’s clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces.: 1.6313076228681562
He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch.: 1.6939933543347825

But their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose.: 1.838104634542796

No, let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina.: 1.4263970456408457
And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest.: 1.8843759400439937

He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise.: 1.6820727069340238
Yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine.: 1.8269938782151856
Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful.: 1.769910856209324
The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a _flair,_ for the cruder things of life.: 2.4703159802502257
A scene disengages itself in the observer’s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures.: 1.7586077532814868
A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock.: 1.7430987968687761
And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit.: 1.6802606351622222
A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands.: 1.63527099933887
He frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the _piazzetta_ giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles Vergängliche_) in her glad look.: 2.0174987549900383

But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the word.: 1.768601515319774

You have a car?...: 3.2809048217644032
CORNY KELLEHER: _(Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.)_ Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet’s.: 1.9668311556063018
Like princes, faith.: 1.4230903580022065
One of them lost two quid on the race.: 1.952443687717334
And were on for a go with the jolly girls.: 1.985509002458249
So I landed them up on Behan’s car and down to nighttown.: 1.603526283723841

Hah, hah, hah!: 1.7820142480689038
BLOOM: _(Tries to laugh.)_ He, he, he!: 3.7912872587919333
Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don’t know him (poor fellow, he’s laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...: 2.2984210984788955

_(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it.: 1.5248927822305862
The horse harness jingles.)_  CORNY KELLEHER: _(From the car, standing.)_ Night.: 2.584515143199992
BLOOM: Night.: 1.5567736461733095
_(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly.: 2.020521344575891
The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly, and turn.: 1.6175202135274747
Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Bloom’s plight.: 2.3908644198850326
The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat.: 1.5323086362252556
Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply.: 1.8726965148997319
With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs.: 1.6918544796515254
Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand.: 2.7141308872084275
Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay.: 3.074676563205539
The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo lay.: 2.096595950761718
Bloom, holding in his hand Stephen’s hat, festooned with shavings, and ashplant, stands irresolute.: 2.303457034745777
Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)_  BLOOM: Eh!: 2.5861574972462167

Somnambulist.: 2.420709619727489

_(There is no answer.: 2.092321085045502
He calls again.)_ Stephen!: 3.2865638222624294

_(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body.: 2.088470666368196
Bloom, holding the hat and ashplant, stands erect.: 2.343738217815372
A dog barks in the distance.: 1.632459332423769
Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant.: 3.198483893172619
He looks down on Stephen’s face and form.)_  BLOOM: _(Communes with the night.)_ Face reminds me of his poor mother.: 2.5827717495049467

_(Silent, thoughtful, alert he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master.: 1.6383187379299635
Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand.: 1.9641176768820334
He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)_  BLOOM: _(Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.)_ Rudy!: 1.9729052441491701
RUDY: _(Gazes, unseeing, into Bloom’s eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling.: 2.3867836018121817
He has a delicate mauve face.: 2.205829111768418
On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons.: 1.3626310764278615
In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot.: 1.610199428914422
A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)_     — III —   [ 16 ]  Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed.: 1.754579861016012
His (Stephen’s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman’s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral.: 1.9840836112004185
But how to get there was the rub.: 2.320357717626463
For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned.: 1.8619511372211448
So far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition, both of them being e.d.ed, particularly Stephen, always assuming that there was such a thing to be found.: 2.0336600929563535
Accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier’s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin’s.: 1.9497029130473167
But as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.: 2.134820004111279
This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did.: 1.8080178540999332
So, bevelling around by Mullett’s and the Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance.: 2.5118077007169957
They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station.: 1.5896836717541967
Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird’s the stonecutter’s in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as his _fidus Achates_ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke’s city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable.: 2.1345805685730723
Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke’s the baker’s it is said.: 2.1874279857875596
_En route_ to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution _re_ the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn’t look out.: 1.898725825067473
Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about.: 2.019274201273576
The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot.: 1.9879269010812994
Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes.: 1.8595270446851218
Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything.: 1.8318616351618608
You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the _demimonde_ ran away with a lot of £.: 2.373164421279723
d.: 3.8019539057396092
into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically.: 1.7565361586370005
Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting _confrères_ but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.: 2.513446936678683
—And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind.: 2.2422583927345983
Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox.: 1.8751909832453182
He began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a _quondam_ friend of his father’s, Gumley.: 1.8855918921036188
To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.: 2.023501434631863
—Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.: 1.9062977256373115
A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again, calling:  —Night!: 1.5237150890044415
Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment.: 1.6779933436986816
Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least.: 1.661069912033002
Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment’s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garrotted.: 1.7883408272463075
Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley’s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice.: 1.9771795670890304
Lord John Corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise.: 2.1425534298502016
He was the eldest son of inspector Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married a certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer.: 2.0000615291239137
His grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.: 1.4395555160797595
Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen.: 1.7168676604561675
Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.: 1.8497240659807335
Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings.: 1.9696686796031921
His friends had all deserted him.: 1.3232418707701015
Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions.: 2.6238072699238533
He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God’s earth he could get something, anything at all, to do.: 2.374474079033265
No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn’t a complete fabrication from start to finish.: 2.441867965198885
Anyhow he was all in.: 6.3798863120211085
—I wouldn’t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows I’m on the rocks.: 2.2324102917754725
—There’ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys’ school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher.: 2.466429464272585
Mr Garrett Deasy.: 2.903754792377125
Try it.: 4.179890446656158
I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh.: 2.2359885057150635
I got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers.: 1.9706511055533154
—I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.: 2.052023936330941
Corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street.: 1.9067903061617184
There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney’s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M’Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob.: 2.437384581553476
He was starving too though he hadn’t said a word about it.: 1.8139529592761483
Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen’s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley’s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence.: 1.9001706143433097
However _haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished.: 2.442124618432213
But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley’s head that he was living in affluence and hadn’t a thing to do but hand out the needful.: 2.492530653335141
Whereas.: 4.692588392222307
He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing.: 2.0661546353517886
A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation.: 1.9488244365189553
He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact.: 2.0211236158979693
He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect.: 1.8927792086474857
About biscuits he dimly remembered.: 1.440601333587472
Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy.: 1.5627688193552902
However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out.: 2.701477604176554
—Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.: 2.518137929590914
And so in point of fact they turned out to be.: 2.2404401991030696
Stephen anyhow lent him one of them.: 2.367189390489038
—Thanks, Corley answered, you’re a gentleman.: 2.9414515768816436
I’ll pay you back one time.: 2.516202929468887
Who’s that with you?: 5.644866249971643
I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker.: 2.084244956602518
You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there.: 2.0716002818045336
I’d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they’re full up for the next three weeks, man.: 2.2280919063519145
God, you’ve to book ahead, man, you’d think it was for the Carl Rosa.: 3.204139768509059
I don’t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a crossing sweeper.: 2.2194716775683263
Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam’s, the shipchandler’s, bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle’s back with O’Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe.: 2.7782662833701273
Anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.: 1.7935163210074128
He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen’s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when.: 2.2285010496424054
Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity.: 1.8616374668922993
Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether.: 2.3972934200024416
In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning.: 2.1110939035198992
Pretty thick that was certainly.: 1.5571759379940269
The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite.: 2.4962987891724366
Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen, that is:  —He is down on his luck.: 3.615122005620772
He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.: 2.0024343756919016
At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively:  —Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say.: 2.475685579653161
Now you mention it his face was familiar to me.: 1.6402757019478704
But, leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?: 2.6556922652061736
—Half a crown, Stephen responded.: 2.3956661678703894
I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.: 2.162468911145257
—Needs!: 4.376387593796733
Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does.: 2.2063693023812156
Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds.: 1.6713274947458485
But, talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself?: 2.169317461053581
Walking to Sandycove is out of the question.: 2.483488998933853
And even supposing you did you won’t get in after what occurred at Westland Row station.: 2.068614497315095
Simply fag out there for nothing.: 1.544123119552995
I don’t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father’s house?: 2.9956040574389498
—To seek misfortune, was Stephen’s answer.: 3.0348609243409665
—I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on yesterday.: 2.0233562431270937
Where does he live at present?: 1.7480778434915105
I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.: 3.254060837634048
—I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.: 3.285260921496958
—A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one.: 2.5728978830436495
He takes great pride, quite legitimate, out of you.: 1.7914577237141707
You could go back perhaps, he hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did.: 1.9972242457543248
There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it was, Stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or something like that.: 2.1907479783330612
—No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn’t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes.: 1.9555188133598842
He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals.: 1.71473487409462
Of course you didn’t notice as much as I did.: 2.501176433507935
But it wouldn’t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.: 1.8726000069643554
He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.: 1.8658594135956421
—Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out.: 2.021875775276339
The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at Stephen’s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less.: 1.7526051703920105
Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.: 1.4762931798187495
Adjacent to the men’s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.: 1.6709135360780838
Ho ragione?: 3.28948643490311
Culo rotto!_  _—Intendiamoci.: 3.4213825908836575
Mezzo sovrano più..._  _—Dice lui, però!_  _—Mezzo._  _—Farabutto!: 2.61149260936937
Mortacci sui!_  _—Ma ascolta!: 4.1283404722299295
Cinque la testa più..._  Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman’s shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in.: 2.05883482111531
A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.: 2.002007048193203
—Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.: 2.1482307956744595
Accordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order these commodities quietly.: 1.389495958773426
The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor.: 1.8491587473292157
Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his _protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious:  —A beautiful language.: 2.2675535930768227
Why do you not write your poetry in that language?: 1.9760125138097335
_Bella Poetria_!: 19.40390797972481
It is so melodious and full.: 2.589965307366018
_Belladonna.: 5.467216183749365
Voglio._  Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering from lassitude generally, replied:  —To fill the ear of a cow elephant.: 2.152454891786395
They were haggling over money.: 6.356480791964657
—Is that so?: 4.859648261338625
Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.: 2.3479856124307577
The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tête-à-tête_ put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed.: 1.7532384942120756
After which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to.: 2.3967572363255436
For which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.: 1.8967735925236562
—Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time, like names.: 2.361303651325405
Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody.: 3.2473146129466346
Jesus, Mr Doyle.: 2.1330514102017655
Shakespeares were as common as Murphies.: 1.4753480872124494
What’s in a name?: 4.027029087740263
—Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred.: 4.850456561880646
Of course.: 8.593919269109799
Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.: 1.7367376145712095
Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion’s boot but Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter, answered:  —Dedalus.: 1.5968826178954658
The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water.: 2.0310321751829794
—You know Simon Dedalus?: 4.6219694987187365
he asked at length.: 4.899273893268704
—I’ve heard of him, Stephen said.: 4.220357556297273
Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too.: 2.6725698058295695
—He’s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding.: 2.038884892796655
All Irish.: 11.243992426883196
—All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.: 1.7897857656365581
As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark:  —I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder.: 1.9774435768781438
The lefthand dead shot.: 1.3644809903401014
Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.: 2.287368718187455
—Bottles out there, say.: 2.134259796258873
Fifty yards measured.: 1.2258274465740135
Eggs on the bottles.: 1.533961868778168
Cocks his gun over his shoulder.: 1.6237105834604475
Aims.: 2.420709619727489
He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely.: 1.9224226238780586
Then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.: 2.2973014731391843
—Pom!: 4.275802651817528
he then shouted once.: 1.2459275163991936
The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg.: 1.9486757861057253
—Pom!: 4.275802651817528
he shouted twice.: 16.929587551173153
—Beg pardon, the sailor said.: 1.9587866300075867
—Long ago?: 17.27359529485326
—Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years.: 2.2281233476991567
He toured the wide world with Hengler’s Royal Circus.: 2.380273215739531
I seen him do that in Stockholm.: 3.549975850435766
—Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.: 3.1895884978510285
—Murphy’s my name, the sailor continued.: 3.2451562604779425
D.: 3.8019539057396092
B.: 1.9699189886569854
Murphy of Carrigaloe.: 1.7443462855480456
Know where that is?: 7.016862480212946
—Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.: 3.598315834959612
—That’s right, the sailor said.: 3.4283536580150953
Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle.: 1.4162457833507187
That’s where I hails from.: 2.598210966565216
I belongs there.: 1.2515713866948655
That’s where I hails from.: 2.598210966565216
My little woman’s down there.: 2.8086136933604604
She’s waiting for me, I know.: 4.107476069587836
_For England, home and beauty_.: 2.011247725285844
She’s my own true wife I haven’t seen for seven years now, sailing about.: 2.170577277514868
Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming to the mariner’s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a rainy night with a blind moon.: 2.0389247636009062
Across the world for a wife.: 1.5997699605302331
Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O’Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.: 1.9928328003869469
Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee.: 2.328139369731405
The face at the window!: 2.6769555651895236
Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections.: 1.792708456571144
You little expected me but I’ve come to stay and make a fresh start.: 2.0831940865737364
There she sits, a grasswidow, at the selfsame fireside.: 3.2637926538188995
Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the deep.: 1.7453823017947852
And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions.: 1.812076578094214
Broo!: 8.936658005791672
The wind!: 10.920367235674814
Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, _post mortem_ child.: 2.2526234438600254
With a high ro!: 1.4214204563144421
and a randy ro!: 1.2429756911123186
and my galloping tearing tandy, O!: 1.3759220720517154
Bow to the inevitable.: 3.0652518536024282
Grin and bear it.: 1.3664761645643972
I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband W.: 1.4632535078242401
B.: 1.9699189886569854
Murphy.: 4.115782963523997
The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request:  —You don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?: 2.1430473859057426
The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand.: 1.6602500501274684
—Thank you, the sailor said.: 3.9862932675625737
He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow stammers, proceeded:  —We come up this morning eleven o’clock.: 1.6411965622435627
I shipped to get over.: 3.294475506743003
Paid off this afternoon.: 1.52008086832009
There’s my discharge.: 7.773483360103091
See?: 7.162440707745693
D.: 3.8019539057396092
B.: 1.9699189886569854
Murphy.: 4.115782963523997
B.: 1.9699189886569854
In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.: 1.8467900142810045
—You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.: 2.7116472550889124
—Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I’ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on.: 2.2462084026759976
I was in China and North America and South America.: 1.876220080221497
We was chased by pirates one voyage.: 1.6302480847227003
I seen icebergs plenty, growlers.: 1.35506004313401
I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship.: 2.1848545835578417
I seen Russia.: 2.638101694793712
_Gospodi pomilyou_.: 6.384863606228335
That’s how the Russians prays.: 6.1498354763923455
—You seen queer sights, don’t be talking, put in a jarvey.: 2.715473918299444
—Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug.: 1.8562047776147583
I seen queer things too, ups and downs.: 1.4891054778694752
I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.: 1.5221401190023547
He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously:  —Khaan!: 2.1435877748112366
Like that.: 6.486038492322951
And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses.: 2.1215487765973395
Look here.: 2.5151563447369205
Here they are.: 1.7400060185060562
A friend of mine sent me.: 2.4614549420490968
He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table.: 1.8939565204156752
The printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios.: 1.3995544228055357
Beni, Bolivia._  All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.: 2.2219559983646646
Stomachs like breadgraters.: 1.5805687845046463
Cuts off their diddies when they can’t bear no more children.: 2.3174212782569135
See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse’s liver raw.: 1.6103541386327533
His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more.: 1.8986992557334152
—Know how to keep them off?: 3.1589226079382575
he inquired generally.: 1.207327752868061
Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying:  —Glass.: 1.8253610503036437
That boggles ’em.: 1.5387702886108876
Glass.: 4.221848002616561
Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark.: 2.3437882461631383
It ran as follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, Chile._ There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.: 2.072880213937093
Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which occasion the former’s ball passed through the latter’s hat) having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q.t.: 2.056716664067368
somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend’s _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest.: 2.3837159256390104
Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through.: 1.6268750770605331
But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd’s heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back.: 1.8716914183832722
The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with.: 1.8177925153326964
Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative.: 1.9109060429739824
Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M’Coy type lend me your valise and I’ll post you the ticket.: 2.0758997485428234
No, something top notch, an all star Irish caste, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure.: 1.6922382445313218
But who?: 3.134775983244503
That was the rub.: 4.384726783611364
Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times _apropos_ of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally.: 2.8377479290916474
A great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large, the average man, i.e.: 1.8543758713597487
Brown, Robinson and Co.: 1.5165682102218454
It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the system really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me for a wife.: 2.1733305459184273
After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.: 2.127833373604146
There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn’t come down, and in the wilds of Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d’œil_ was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O’Malley, George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men’s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour’s run from the pillar.: 1.9655260444267988
Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired.: 2.1053349874618705
Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact.: 2.2091469702071924
He turned back the other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.: 2.4547225820060707
—I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different.: 1.9164776329926332
One was a ship, another was a house, another was a flower.: 2.116806573670401
Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the chinks does.: 2.717792542134061
Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.: 3.4559054799454323
—And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap.: 2.1047745595688787
Knife in his back.: 3.792177799609265
Knife like that.: 1.732835998365353
Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position.: 2.5867231473988794
—In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.: 3.9548062388821337
Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him.: 1.9428304816314168
Like that.: 6.486038492322951
_Prepare to meet your God_, says he.: 3.12489521571149
Chuk!: 8.936658005791672
It went into his back up to the butt.: 2.7124110077088694
His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to.: 1.7716833992491627
—That’s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable _stiletto_.: 2.2323961747022527
After which harrowing _dénouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.: 1.9855986977990185
—They’re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all.: 2.2334610227174583
That was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives.: 1.9614408191569777
At this remark passed obviously in the spirit of _where ignorance is bliss_ Mr B.: 1.686028884030979
and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, _alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair.: 1.7670469187227755
His inscrutable face which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn’t understand one jot of what was going on.: 2.048953722465856
Funny, very!: 1.7701423118391468
There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause.: 1.2203289521159166
One man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the natives _choza de_, another the seaman’s discharge.: 1.7012410341219173
Mr Bloom, so far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood.: 2.312620114714936
He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen.: 2.170132568726121
—Ay, boss, the sailor broke in.: 2.961037626094492
Give us back them papers.: 1.3335653331601087
The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.: 2.741429494873305
—Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar?: 3.140874849408508
Mr Bloom inquired.: 1.2012846516222362
The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or no.: 2.5388031994555775
—Ah, you’ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.: 2.3659732429714335
—What year would that be about?: 1.5634979960421729
Mr B interrogated.: 1.1719544252990588
Can you recall the boats?: 1.6649019017582827
Our _soi-disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering:  —I’m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.: 2.2605489236988707
Salt junk all the time.: 2.900745401113013
Tired seemingly, he ceased.: 1.5451646936464425
His questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves.: 2.1858216526571717
On more than one occasion, a dozen at the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings.: 1.6648158517053406
And it left him wondering why.: 1.3504645506389545
Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not exactly under, tempting the fates.: 2.3599005298695475
And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all.: 1.6310943330244225
Nevertheless, without going into the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.: 1.9411428064312768
—There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_, the old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman’s valet at six quid a month.: 2.7571541171780583
Them are his trousers I’ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife.: 2.3891450732503645
I’m game for that job, shaving and brushup.: 2.2124389981114354
I hate roaming about.: 1.2819790192638612
There’s my son now, Danny, run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper’s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money.: 2.2143325071538937
—What age is he?: 2.0943645857539255
queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.: 2.133938644718667
—Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?: 2.1060650997986623
He’d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.: 2.083347868724611
The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an anchor.: 1.7639945012298024
—There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts.: 1.7064012964197253
I must get a wash tomorrow or next day.: 1.6915769463297532
It’s them black lads I objects to.: 2.2814102367163405
I hate those buggers.: 2.300252134497652
Suck your blood dry, they does.: 1.36521778533012
Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner’s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a young man’s sideface looking frowningly rather.: 2.0626457355070205
—Tattoo, the exhibitor explained.: 3.5324138857217218
That was done when we were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton.: 2.5492827907587987
Fellow, the name of Antonio, done that.: 2.1567494738345294
There he is himself, a Greek.: 4.823491850213107
—Did it hurt much doing it?: 2.1202432973592793
one asked the sailor.: 2.366051314160737
That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.: 1.8609748593896243
Someway in his.: 1.8645877905571073
Squeezing or.: 13.008414115405373
—See here, he said, showing Antonio.: 2.6483473124156927
There he is cursing the mate.: 2.37507694738868
And there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.: 2.4313723526818083
And in point of fact the young man named Antonio’s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this time stretched over.: 1.7423496733805481
—Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest.: 2.4283420693520115
He’s gone too.: 6.256912563497667
Ate by sharks after.: 1.217886567539966
Ay, ay.: 3.764067182520707
He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before.: 2.0130926203291586
—Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.: 2.198455117686236
—And what’s the number for?: 3.2348558509262735
loafer number two queried.: 5.592670005226708
—Eaten alive?: 1.7071547556188644
a third asked the sailor.: 1.9210031836847195
—Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number.: 1.9284951663898768
Ate.: 3.6792075637995274
A Greek he was.: 1.5320717297601152
And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged end:       —As bad as old Antonio,      For he left me on my ownio.: 1.8171307834802148
The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill.: 2.323728332214747
Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink.: 2.079781112612947
His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.) and begged the chance of his washing.: 1.9116793687807168
Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not, your washing.: 1.3967166843303647
Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife’s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a man’s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper’s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt.: 2.2091799126261957
Still just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female’s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off.: 1.835594158110951
Round the side of the _Evening Telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper Murphy’s nautical chest and then there was no more of her.: 2.2811796032034697
—The gunboat, the keeper said.: 6.668475864729432
—It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the least.: 1.7881692761924926
Unfortunate creature!: 1.697074052002457
Of course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.: 1.775556270380614
Still no matter what the cause is from...: 1.836039663074918
Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking:  —In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade.: 1.7898066046227783
Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul.: 1.5406507592314531
She is a bad merchant.: 2.1978294460254384
She buys dear and sells cheap.: 1.3003120611708685
The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start.: 2.335714048829887
Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.: 3.262795399730619
—You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe in the soul.: 1.7185271385760426
Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup.: 2.537980679714417
Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance.: 1.6107661562010853
Do you?: 15.18453733679981
Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say:  —They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible.: 2.084979910920597
It would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both being excluded by court etiquette.: 1.818256380811911
Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining:  —Simple?: 2.286177884437164
I shouldn’t think that is the proper word.: 2.527223581603063
Of course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon.: 1.9400490738053777
But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean, and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.: 2.182632014885254
—O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence.: 1.971296947374023
On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed.: 1.695661309695118
—Has been?: 11.659632197408452
the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief.: 2.0076740235623443
I’m not so sure about that.: 3.1681064313437024
That’s a matter for everyman’s opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you _in toto_ there.: 2.547499423015725
My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it’s the big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them like _Hamlet_ and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn’t tell you.: 1.924569582416904
Can’t you drink that coffee, by the way?: 3.603779079995372
Let me stir it.: 1.247159795791779
And take a piece of that bun.: 2.4343378406983267
It’s like one of our skipper’s bricks disguised.: 2.3980520824287836
Still no-one can give what he hasn’t got.: 2.416134649556954
Try a bit.: 15.411873995256956
—Couldn’t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further.: 2.2041035489016596
Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and lucrative) work.: 1.7789428856439429
To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders.: 1.8112512984753886
On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying.: 2.015116828055074
The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of.: 2.0635010810685572
Sulphate of copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn’t remember when it was or where.: 1.9412732778272672
Anyhow inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble’s Vi-Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved.: 2.019778468287223
Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage.: 2.28315854106459
—Still it’s solid food, his good genius urged, I’m a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work, mental or manual.: 2.2389645637786946
You ought to eat more solid food.: 2.239606761567394
You would feel a different man.: 2.141620340921533
—Liquids I can eat, Stephen said.: 1.8243879928281015
But O, oblige me by taking away that knife.: 1.4460364035910362
I can’t look at the point of it.: 4.003933506359369
It reminds me of Roman history.: 1.9632319877031106
Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.: 1.5974167154523102
—Our mutual friend’s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom _apropos_ of knives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_.: 2.435102058486285
Do you think they are genuine?: 2.557473860995011
He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots.: 1.560589622847765
Look at him.: 2.868269890528569
Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel.: 1.956175068503554
He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him.: 2.1915602958410476
Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity.: 2.156722173181238
On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner _Hesperus_ and etcetera.: 1.814935477959203
And when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn’t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.: 1.8117032925123362
—Mind you, I’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention, he resumed.: 2.8842613431595767
Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with.: 1.7246865715403545
Giants, though that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the midget queen.: 2.807073580213413
There’s an example again of simple souls.: 2.8431033482062147
However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who reminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded.: 2.2918164331797457
On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.: 2.160631401111805
—Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen.: 1.9767101676774017
It comes from the great heat, climate generally.: 1.4886787251574052
My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is.: 1.9557647526529558
Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) Spain, i.e.: 1.7873655786726534
Gibraltar.: 4.4668761695549595
She has the Spanish type.: 1.6638436841271216
Quite dark, regular brunette, black.: 2.089282834249878
I for one certainly believe climate accounts for character.: 1.3094224974450575
That’s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian.: 3.286626892731713
—The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very passionate about ten shillings.: 2.0792035234760813
_Roberto ruba roba sua_.: 4.520045717876411
—Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.: 6.091273294160095
—Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.: 2.689025633806628
—It’s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once.: 3.8834465802757365
All are washed in the blood of the sun.: 1.9318248529467597
Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there.: 2.2437435009380238
The splendid proportions of hips, bosom.: 1.2820940383880493
You simply don’t knock against those kind of women here.: 1.9289889830999836
An exception here and there.: 2.210861824782775
Handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but what I’m talking about is the female form.: 2.356235515585751
Besides they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman’s natural beauty, no matter what you say.: 2.076148433653117
Rumpled stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it’s a thing I simply hate to see.: 2.543273143101463
Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing.: 2.0261262721864024
Shipahoy of course had his own say to say.: 1.996994549691728
He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.: 2.311556786073223
So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt’s rock, wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand.: 1.9448270274498385
That was the talk of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish _Times_), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror.: 1.594284372104725
Then someone said something about the case of the s.: 2.14238651307449
_Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_ which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck.: 1.764909047755677
No aid was given.: 1.489000733386495
Her master, the _Mona_’s, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way.: 2.2764284474617074
She had no water, it appears, in her hold.: 2.027127262832685
At this stage an incident happened.: 1.2471919112985455
It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.: 2.7940376000200344
—Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze.: 2.059681482377608
He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left.: 2.2371412575235943
While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship’s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise.: 2.0974011720683046
The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved.: 2.101639666624704
Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank.: 1.8854831496758784
A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled.: 1.328669883136093
Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ 100 a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of.: 1.7018948132143732
And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver.: 2.2692067436397827
He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if—a big if, however—he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality.: 1.6823047332431584
All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping, coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing.: 1.934437535209358
A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin, the only launch that year.: 1.5407161743492601
Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called.: 1.336939771517331
There were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently _au fait_.: 2.131727406495159
What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington or some name like that, eh?: 1.8392640793580122
Ask the then captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day’s work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.: 1.9949004885958685
—Am I right, skipper?: 2.763659145998208
he queried of the sailor, now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions.: 1.9439324272228151
That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds.: 1.9457677575406946
Mr Bloom’s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question.: 1.8657342437938704
Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation-_cum_-potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the _soirée_, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook:       —The biscuits was as hard as brass      And the beef as salt as Lot’s wife’s arse.: 2.3131297976195553
O, Johnny Lever!: 1.3791941724593502
Johnny Lever, O!: 1.6783829059332498
After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided.: 1.8478456328910817
Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God’s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein.: 1.9352806248976335
Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact.: 1.9826212046077358
You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco.: 1.9508996205530238
Where would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon?: 1.9963062061610553
But a day of reckoning, he stated _crescendo_ with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes.: 1.790623987464533
There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history.: 2.1735264158847905
The Germans and the Japs were going to have their little lookin, he affirmed.: 3.5610130225884813
The Boers were the beginning of the end.: 1.8987706489969591
Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot.: 1.4840934578266294
His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland.: 1.745148608798229
Silence all round marked the termination of his _finale_.: 1.8143330450348638
The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.: 1.9424664962151006
—Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.: 2.3555674660846972
To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.: 2.1015928054667237
—Who’s the best troops in the army?: 3.475420094884447
the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated.: 1.2342799947595453
And the best jumpers and racers?: 5.588279450052395
And the best admirals and generals we’ve got?: 2.184414799263283
Tell me that.: 25.25054939479301
—The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishes apart.: 2.0092850895843677
—That’s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated.: 4.3097745630764965
The Irish catholic peasant.: 1.2431539602931836
He’s the backbone of our empire.: 3.5521370893584088
You know Jem Mullins?: 1.2943291240586874
While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it.: 1.4251471401276385
Then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn’t indulge in recriminations and come to blows.: 2.080870266986688
From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite.: 1.9605045440373066
It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart.: 1.8274385991536735
Another little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in fact.: 1.8789924802643707
And now, why?: 2.3909925103064795
So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game.: 2.4467058029989692
And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn’t the other person at all, he (B.) couldn’t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated.: 2.161009962834151
Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on.: 1.98973555168414
In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome.: 2.4336554779288724
He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high.: 2.083108533040795
Like actresses, always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again.: 1.3665746850125313
Generous to a fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow.: 2.695452406302241
So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some £.: 1.8109701193051568
d.: 3.8019539057396092
in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the _Old Ireland_ tavern, come back to Erin and so on.: 2.006579683802519
Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender.: 2.1314403394480927
—He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared, I let slip.: 2.3349486848984338
He called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively.: 2.150561551588038
So I without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality I’m not.: 2.345054326984874
That was one for him.: 2.3154025785620824
A soft answer turns away wrath.: 1.2532691817700747
He hadn’t a word to say for himself as everyone saw.: 2.4780464126762753
Am I not right?: 1.926209099590074
He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn’t all exactly.: 2.4577367841885276
—_Ex quibus_, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four eyes conversing, _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any other, _secundum carnem_.: 2.5246817790577807
—Of course, Mr B.: 4.60784717049474
proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of the question.: 3.0501855599323147
It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it deserves.: 1.667666169037881
But with a little goodwill all round.: 3.513907770128775
It’s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality.: 2.37755738151018
It never reaches anything or stops anything.: 1.2549275782470504
A revolution must come on the due instalments plan.: 1.4456415239718003
It’s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, in the next house so to speak.: 2.8355627652687123
—Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes’ war, Stephen assented, between Skinner’s alley and Ormond market.: 1.4713939302532142
Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that was overwhelmingly right.: 2.5402687898286316
And the whole world was full of that sort of thing.: 2.7547626591153023
—You just took the words out of my mouth, he said.: 2.309138271848799
A hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn’t remotely...: 2.791267176625907
He turned away from the others, who probably… and spoke nearer to, so as the others… in case they…  —Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen’s ear, are accused of ruining.: 1.8937453503934647
Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say.: 2.4640242833271198
History, would you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for, imported them.: 1.7041179817861734
Because they are imbued with the proper spirit.: 3.0452087150437146
They are practical and are proved to be so.: 1.651857742688526
I don’t want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are.: 2.142041039101996
But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest spells poverty.: 1.6173301704518146
Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead America.: 1.5310245331823582
Turks.: 3.0324287377854287
It’s in the dogma.: 5.932611961546459
Because if they didn’t believe they’d go straight to heaven when they die they’d try to live better, at least so I think.: 2.28201224204828
That’s the juggle on which the p.p.’s raise the wind on false pretences.: 2.9018997915414455
I’m, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes _pro rata_ having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of £ 300 per annum.: 1.849212855057863
That’s the vital issue at stake and it’s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man.: 2.4676200688386167
At least that’s my idea for what it’s worth.: 3.602588100795643
_Ubi patria_, as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in _Alma Mater, vita bene_.: 2.807398455724401
Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work.: 2.332360672587498
Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.: 2.643704299369979
He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to.: 1.969883550486644
Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn’t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.: 2.425651400490646
—Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.: 1.5354042015597067
observed or rather his voice speaking did, all must work, have to, together.: 1.8979723459064113
—I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest possible sense.: 2.4680184239632625
Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing.: 1.6221111821131229
Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays.: 2.9502173528624

You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.: 1.7167175409223416
Each is equally important.: 5.689212835019065
—You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may be important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called Ireland for short.: 2.4636712997382233
—I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.: 3.4669516862751864
—But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me.: 1.9643143757602468
—What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension.: 1.9121831853376643
Excuse me.: 3.4874117181906445
Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the latter portion.: 2.2240591891899655
What was it you...?: 6.343106411745159
Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding:  —We can’t change the country.: 1.7776620649562205
Let us change the subject.: 2.1488748684659478
At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down but in a quandary, as he couldn’t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry.: 2.2252055707198917
The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part.: 1.8748740564156199
Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state.: 1.6438509082873407
Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn’t been familiarised with the right sort of people.: 1.9759809054792097
With a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves.: 1.8437256831140123
For instance there was the case of O’Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact).: 2.011775283349736
And then the usual _dénouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act, certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains.: 1.8569033487660684
Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it.: 2.064879456198383
Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental.: 1.9531950370227769

Still to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small.: 1.5893622895041637
Intellectual stimulation, as such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind.: 1.8166964059724884
Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz.: 1.752946410324243

And so forth and so on.: 1.8182595512040822
All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years.: 1.7779172252661575
Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered.: 2.008048997560156
Something evidently riled them in his death.: 1.7471252401030009
Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands.: 1.6043226016978558
Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility.: 1.7055632765390076
Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren’t even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between.: 1.7897160396004246
It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay, and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging.: 1.6396140443269398

He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the _Insuppressible_ or was it _United Ireland_, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said _Thank you_, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip: what’s bred in the bone.: 1.9119305918152627
Still as regards return.: 1.3901105761920398
You were a lucky dog if they didn’t set the terrier at you directly you got back.: 1.8862087268495475
Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against.: 1.8264515429376444
And then, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, _Bella_ was the boat’s name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew was it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce himself with: _Excuse me, my name is So and So_ or some such commonplace remark.: 2.1195155287294063
A more prudent course, as Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first.: 2.1057599411412675
—That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor commented.: 1.813979981120699

I seen her picture in a barber’s.: 1.5672414320659827
The husband was a captain or an officer.: 1.623846808688214
This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his _entourage_.: 1.449253290129818
As regards Bloom he, without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings.: 1.768275977280835
First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into.: 1.84468236679891
Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of.: 1.9843372513793882
Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one’s smiles.: 2.14629711524557
The eternal question of the life connubial, needless to say, cropped up.: 1.80651112757897
Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist between married folk?: 1.8024279867605513
Poser.: 5.467216183749365
Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of folly.: 1.734075117824844
Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream.: 2.0225558268166983
And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times.: 1.5867843254219312
Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side.: 2.2987280346553964
North or south, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that wouldn’t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.: 2.151334564799089
—Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to Stephen, about blood and the sun.: 2.3812425473835566
And, if I don’t greatly mistake she was Spanish too.: 2.9932970458917185
—The king of Spain’s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many.: 2.341996462914271
Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any means, I never heard that rumour before.: 2.084949873474684
Possible, especially there, it was as she lived there.: 2.034436568101575
So, Spain.: 1.5626363342030458
Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he.: 2.0302855312537513
—Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?: 2.7146469340933135
Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was _In Old Madrid_, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue.: 1.9192215336523646
Her (the lady’s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin’s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution.: 2.3144530174424247
—Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom indicated.: 1.7331774815494827
Taken a few years since.: 1.8447615549484586
In or about ninety six.: 1.7304876018147888
Very like her then.: 1.6571299868230707
Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen.: 1.814090037832014
As for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup.: 2.040833624721678
She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the.: 2.867647826263646
He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art, in the National Museum.: 2.1080675183904543
Marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest.: 2.4138037424880605
Yes, puritanisme, it does though, Saint Joseph’s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne toi trop.: 2.297265767440736
Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn’t art in a word.: 1.9907461624916223
The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar’s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to.: 1.702690132924111
But it was scarcely professional etiquette so.: 2.021415518128181
Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm.: 1.860339004972772
And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion.: 1.7237239814452154
Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other’s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving _embonpoint_.: 1.5068149883146522
In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch out.: 1.6793895359500217
Suppose she was gone when he?: 1.9336355040693174
I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses (_sic_) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.: 1.7061216547104363
The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, _distingué_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would.: 2.2894942236994864
Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter.: 1.9234381976896606
And why not?: 1.4141288059703065
An awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business.: 2.3597299350829033
How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate.: 1.737974517289251
Then the decree _nisi_ and the King’s proctor tries to show cause why and, he failing to quash it, _nisi_ was made absolute.: 2.18064084604033
But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course.: 2.1041840000385617
He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin’s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen leader’s, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader’s) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the _Insuppressible_ or no it was _United Ireland_ (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O’Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune’s private morals.: 2.205536727992435
Though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive.: 1.9406062433330025
As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap’s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character.: 1.8363914079960677
His hat (Parnell’s) a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what’s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother’s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you, sir_, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.: 1.9309644000189992
On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms, drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others.: 1.7927531180654335
He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed and didn’t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_ between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.: 1.8775225082027516
It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime.: 1.6712746540609478
In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies’ society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers’ ways and flowers and chocs.: 1.9225294653972589
To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age.: 2.8563393757470044
The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other’s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.: 1.7222125331711218
—At what o’clock did you dine?: 2.316935833409417
he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face.: 1.8534539445890708
—Some time yesterday, Stephen said.: 1.962368122935353
—Yesterday!: 5.876627601226786
exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow Friday.: 1.5945163107030362
Ah, you mean it’s after twelve!: 5.935443112766309
—The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.: 3.740133215179424
Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.: 1.753292234094074
Though they didn’t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of thought.: 1.9285878027701193
At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas.: 2.0527948597791053
For instance when the evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people’s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn’t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan’s so that he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.: 1.984652999487914
Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it was, it was high time to be retiring for the night.: 3.122158727690938
The crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue (somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed unknown) with a lame paw (not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he had hurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he very distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak.: 1.876245433880153
On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives.: 2.2821172175333166
Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered.: 2.4079139598582464
His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway.: 1.7681535905857697
For one thing he mightn’t what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn’t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable.: 1.8796513644594854
At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps’s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up.: 2.0451122852765873
A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn’t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger’s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character’s whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids’) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody’s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra remarks _passim_.: 1.8535177303851929
At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew.: 2.00693601196697
People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep.: 1.5751191336084993
The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles.: 1.31945040385494
Your god was a jew.: 1.8323149238935923
Because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo.: 2.7795124909592626
—I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo, as it’s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over.: 1.7689650093193365
My diggings are quite close in the vicinity.: 2.1168093041290716
You can’t drink that stuff.: 2.6552138113997517
Wait.: 2.730457598080893
I’ll just pay this lot.: 2.920517409111314
The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty who didn’t seem to.: 1.888480089511648
—Yes, that’s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.: 2.2471888216768177
All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (B’s) busy brain, education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits, up to date billing, concert tours in English watering resorts packed with hydros and seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things, no necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it, and a slice of luck.: 1.775924496676568
An opening was all was wanted.: 1.5046528450541483
Because he more than suspected he had his father’s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to.: 2.143328649904822
The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers’ association dinner in London somewhere.: 2.3175985920609476
Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement.: 1.4030763321804254
Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary’s lodge or words to that effect.: 1.9149509004454577
To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why.: 2.6895831372097327
—Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner put in, manifesting some natural impatience.: 2.348328344142189
—And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.: 1.6224415485640453
The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.: 2.3259360900460586
—Are you bad in the eyes?: 3.660215180501907
the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried.: 2.5069692082677832
—Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.: 2.108840307590357
Sand in the Red Sea done that.: 1.6656652404853098
One time I could read a book in the dark, manner of speaking.: 2.3583687273106513
_The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my favourite and _Red as a Rose is She._  Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what, found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark.: 1.7427656793158153
To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.: 1.704121472779227
—Come, he counselled to close the _séance_.: 2.2852505907745293
Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the _élite_ society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their _dolce far niente_.: 1.6232664218701027
Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.: 2.15458873361765
—One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the moment.: 2.558838415572153
Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside down, on the tables in cafés.: 2.0764000393489583
To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment’s hesitation, saying straight off:  —To sweep the floor in the morning.: 1.7378002102337935
So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion’s right, a habit of his, by the bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles.: 2.061896919848941
The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.: 2.0103612252017826
—It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a moment.: 2.374018410656419
The only thing is to walk then you’ll feel a different man.: 2.24979824293957
Come.: 5.158532059711846
It’s not far.: 7.66195692411032
Lean on me.: 1.6968696087942614
Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen’s right and led him on accordingly.: 2.88834862968349
—Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that.: 2.695744380410782
Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc.: 1.561245407179051
where the municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new.: 1.7012754280048836
And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.: 2.0781661713246193
So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm in arm across Beresford place.: 1.8706779077282247
Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante’s _Huguenots_, Meyerbeer’s _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart’s _Twelfth Mass_ he simply revelled in, the _Gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat.: 2.283410630865968
He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini’s _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers’ church in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather.: 1.8362421976218763
There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore.: 2.068716889770739
On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_, a gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn.: 1.9568498504051004
And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel’s air in _Martha, M’appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen’s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat.: 2.2765386875972466
Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn’t sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare’s songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B.: 2.056138272859387
did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_ and _comes_ conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.: 2.3018309959273484
On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull.: 1.8085422902014376
He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.: 2.258560066307566
By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other’s sleeve gently, jocosely remarking:  —Our lives are in peril tonight.: 1.7196157299310293
Beware of the steamroller.: 3.938594307998006
They thereupon stopped.: 1.2261351451625304
Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts.: 2.2663399668453064
But such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn’t a lump of sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up.: 1.9010685755461618
He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world.: 2.434117048485689
But even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan’s, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face.: 2.3852547012694267
But it was no animal’s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump.: 2.397600336248119
Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees.: 1.995232343320598
Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye.: 1.74239417583405
These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen’s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.: 2.2863746031681997
—What’s this I was saying?: 3.3931107046320976
Ah, yes!: 1.8236994063524545
My wife, he intimated, plunging _in medias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.: 2.0002775109518627
He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built.: 1.8604518528813632
Still, supposing he had his father’s gift as he more than suspected, it opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall’s Irish industries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.: 2.1005216462354
Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has End_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from.: 2.715250640489423
Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_ about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit:       Von der Sirenen Listigkeit      Tun die Poeten dichten.: 2.1330610289275387
These opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_.: 1.356406176391496
Bloom, nodding, said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did.: 1.9788512729591794
A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B.: 1.812547074562273
(a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society’s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you.: 2.049099299141505
It was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic _conversaziones_ during the festivities of the Christmas season, for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he happened to know, were on record—in fact, without giving the show away, he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have.: 2.2167796810931923
Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees.: 2.351409356430594
Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time.: 1.8993706799103736
But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped.: 1.555413551242747
Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin’s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_.: 2.191509398406322
Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city’s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows.: 2.1808815330792664
And it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone.: 2.0753708734650353
In fact, he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort, hung on to him at all.: 2.21486924895301
The horse was just then.: 1.5831056418310154
And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on the _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom’s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person’s character, no pun intended.: 1.8227161374737517
The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of turds.: 1.7804798205333447
Slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper he mired.: 2.151592235647514
And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car.: 1.7732653742405802
Side by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.: 1.9195692066519097
Und alle Schiffe brücken.: 1.4780776227873473
The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by Father Maher_.: 1.707674441951076
As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their _tête à tête_ (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens, enemies of man’s reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn’t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street _and looked after their lowbacked car_.: 2.1112160789803047
[ 17 ]   What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?: 1.8111802566988398
Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner’s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place.: 1.6844263955935153
Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George’s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.: 2.0834754087128284
Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?: 2.185609047639821
Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen’s collapse.: 2.221419714545912

Bloom assented covertly to Stephen’s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt († 266 A.D.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree.: 2.3975264765170046

He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.: 2.081887560503894
As in what ways?: 1.5102035981462671
From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.: 1.7093434551570699
What act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?: 1.479247573062046

Bloom’s decision?: 6.905905877415345
A stratagem.: 7.334874834954929
Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.: 1.697626341622299
Did he fall?: 1.2672403596155022
By his body’s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman, pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9, dominical letters C B, Roman indiction 2, Julian period 6617, MCMIV.: 1.9817296568497038
Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle.: 2.022965091755994
What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?: 1.3107559940684113
Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a candle of 1 CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle.: 1.9447828880719085
Did the man reappear elsewhere?: 1.397661732932599
After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor.: 2.0352678905950596
The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges.: 1.4404796957841024
In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.: 2.2473469499591947
Did Stephen obey his sign?: 1.2566035089672671
Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man’s back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom’s house.: 1.8999558341308773
What did Bloom do?: 3.073791193641797
He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M’Donald of 14 D’Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.: 1.7346521449807366
Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?: 1.338839148548668

Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies’ grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.: 1.649754765715612
What did Bloom see on the range?: 2.0556779435262906

Did it flow?: 1.6545628700480448
From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of 2400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of £ 5 per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.: 1.8829132463285574
E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.: 1.8488173476735834
What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier, returning to the range, admire?: 2.1439387468824265
Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator’s projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90 % of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine % marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.: 2.4329103129099217
Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?: 2.0435399219779717
To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington’s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.: 1.6852273166093428
What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom’s offer?: 2.2084400748518025
That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.: 2.227571223996617
What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?: 1.8099082051605113
The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.: 4.846495885678659
What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?: 1.3775440953477123

What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?: 2.6647264778064
The phenomenon of ebullition.: 1.479538438278385
Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether.: 2.181547280733356
Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50° to 212° Fahrenheit.: 1.9898488930879916
What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?: 2.962183315955349

A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman’s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done.: 1.8457702814328858
Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand.: 1.6310528117973202
What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?: 1.87472163596912
The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.: 2.0067085312578694

What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?: 1.2249071775329332

Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?: 1.341572944641375

Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?: 2.0530186205328906
Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.: 1.9114110893680438

Of a different order of difficulty.: 1.6805068283118014
Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.: 1.8167845075451525
And the problem of possible redemption?: 2.0947555025604054
The minor was proved by the major.: 1.359475035532523
Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?: 1.442381340379623
The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions: the waggoner’s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S.: 2.247333038946422
Lawrence (martyr, 10 August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.: 1.9862766496872026
His (Bloom’s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error?: 2.0658854273124074
That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman.: 4.051071414304983
That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence.: 2.074861999333532
Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?: 2.204591161204863

Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters?: 1.5696077044291175
It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.: 2.6855610572692905
What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman?: 2.002592766715029
Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.: 2.052136934753486
What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom’s, who attracted Stephen’s, gaze?: 2.946972988731317

Similarly?: 4.367119097116635
The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom’s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, 210 scholars: Stephen’s higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure.: 2.1405890507123306
What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other?: 1.614671028858583

To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (1 January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails.: 2.2764468059729444

•     [ 18 ]   Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out 1 kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ 10000 for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die 20 times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they  theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea 2 days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give 9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was 1/4 after 3 when I saw the 2 Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him 1 or 2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the _Stabat Mater_ by going around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the 15 acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the 10th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20 quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line 11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about 6/- in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners 3 whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the 4 years more I have of life up to 35 no Im what am I at all Ill be 33 in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street 1st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a—e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page 50 the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were  yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2 the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was 1 of the 7 wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery I went into 1 of them it was so biting cold I couldnt keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no 28 with the Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he made me spend the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming for about 5 minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday  frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half of those old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the W C I’ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last Januarys paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get like Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their 3 Rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs Stanhope sent me from the B Marche paris what a shame my dearest Doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other name was just a p c to tell you I sent the little present have just had a jolly warm bath and feel a very clean dog now enjoyed it wogger she called him wogger wd give anything to be back in Gib and hear you sing Waiting and in old Madrid Concone is the name of those exercises he bought me one of those new some word I couldnt make out shawls amusing things but tear for the least thing still there lovely I think dont you will always think of the lovely teas we had together scrumptious currant scones and raspberry wafers I adore well now dearest Doggerina be sure and write soon kind she left out regards to your father also Captain Grove with love yrs affly Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the 2 things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose theyre dead long ago the 2 of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along I suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails listening to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in Holles street the nurse was after when I put on my gloves and hat at the window to show I was going out not a notion what I meant arent they thick never understand what you say even youd want to print it up on a big poster for them not even if you shake hands twice with the left he didnt recognise me either when I half frowned at him outside Westland row chapel where does their great intelligence come in Id like to know grey matter they have it all in their tail if you ask me those country gougers up in the City Arms intelligence they had a damn sight less than the bulls and cows they were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed dear Madam only his letter and the card from Milly this morning see she wrote a letter to

Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near 80 or a 100 her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack flying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in 3 years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly 20 years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure 18 carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from Africa and that derelict ship that came up to the harbour Marie the Marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that was Gardner yes I can see his face cleanshaven Frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong that train again weeping tone once in the

them like that a bit on my side piano quietly sweeeee theres that train far away pianissimo eeeee one more song  that was a relief wherever you be let your wind go free who knows if that pork chop I took with my cup of tea after was quite good with the heat I couldnt smell anything off it Im sure that queerlooking man in the porkbutchers is a great rogue I hope that lamp is not smoking fill my nose up with smuts better than having him leaving the gas on all night I couldnt rest easy in my bed in Gibraltar even getting up to see why am I so damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those mountains the something Nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with the little bit of a short shift I had up to heat myself I loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance I put out the light too so then there were 2 of us goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow I hope hes not going to get in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again coming in at 4 in the morning it must be if not more still he had the manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice I bought I think Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those 2 lb pots of mixed plum and apple from the London and Newcastle Williams and Woods goes twice as far only for the bones I hate those eels cod yes Ill get a nice piece of cod Im always getting enough for 3 forgetting anyway Im sick of that everlasting butchers meat from Buckleys loin chops and leg beef and rib steak and scrag of mutton and calfs pluck the very name is enough or a picnic suppose we all gave 5/- each and or let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who Mrs Fleming and drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats 1 consolation I wonder what kind is that book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news 20 years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for 2 shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was what 22 or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at 15 my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows theres always something wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4 weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced 40 times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore  who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about 3 weeks I ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about 10 minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart _sweet_heart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet _tart_ goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats 11 years ago now yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after that the 10 of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15 yesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose hes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too in 1/2 a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from 1 years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though  no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent 1 atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same 2 lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our 1st death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for 1 he can make it for 2 Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only 8/6 or 18/6 Ill just give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man Id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then Ill tell him I want £ 1 or perhaps 30/- Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do the indifferent 1 or 2 questions Ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze off 1 2 3 4 5 what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get up early Ill go to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today I mean no no Fridays an unlucky day first I want to do the place up someway the dust grows in it I think while Im asleep then we can have music and cigarettes I can accompany him first I must clean the keys of the piano with milk whatll I wear shall I wear a white rose or those fairy cakes in Liptons I love the smell of a rich big shop at 7 1/2d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky sugar 11d a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes 16 years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.: 1.8501988800382116
