Avg perplexity: 70.32012005980927

 I told you so from the first, you may remember."  "I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly."  "You did!: 49.43368043354513
The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister.: 69.32070984982143
The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances.: 58.59698317726436
Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity, are not worth a regret.: 41.66547712614688
Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep.: 35.12103672429014
Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.: 115.87642777385939
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on.: 37.6976713791068
I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them."  "I am not now to learn," replied Mr.: 17.92626547093139
"Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time.: 36.05109417421407
From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him.: 47.217671462595376
His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal.: 125.36103633261499
They have at least that advantage."  "The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for such a study.: 82.52051055418923
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.: 54.11681617906285
When Mr.: 0.8138573233208121
Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me?: 104.21019613027491
Mrs.: 1.039363023621984
To be sure London was rather thin, but however the little Theatre was open.: 137.32046696448532
Bingley!: 989.9722147355011
Her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her.: 81.16321089898155
and Mrs.: 0.9292231826134522
And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable amount.: 66.33314149641232
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves.: 44.89426254537287
Mamma would like to go too of all things!: 73.86232676296416
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield.: 35.285829685689556
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.: 54.347124873281324
Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.: 36.67683487206935
If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all."         *       *       *       *       *  The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs.: 37.852443576687364
Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family.: 40.687383661940984
Mrs.: 1.039363023621984
Bennet, "that is very unlucky."  "Can I have the carriage?" said Jane.: 23.63104313948933
They were, therefore, to go.--Elizabeth was pleased, though, when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.: 27.019371983599953
They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family.: 45.32079795996183
Lydia left a few lines for his wife,      informing her of their intention.: 56.38601659255459
They were ignorant, idle, and vain.: 6.299828812896674
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.: 96.32976188906682
His temptation is not adequate to the risk."  "Do you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.: 28.437296331583227
I hope he will overlook it.: 11.580370754979496
It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of it.: 19.59624783230548
I will try again.: 72.75603741096914
_He_ shall be mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish."  "No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose.: 35.11547747944129
On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks.: 108.18368144712579
Reynolds replied, that he was, adding, "but we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends." How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!: 66.66692705693616
The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification.: 111.39078593928951
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule."  "Such as vanity and pride."  "Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.: 90.68272008130215
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving home.: 74.87484110910299
Is not he a charming man?: 45.01061989967824
Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one.: 16.696405349785056
Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance."  "I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match," cried Elizabeth.: 24.50862499576989
Hear me in silence.: 33.5544839178101
"A place too, with which so many of your acquaintance are connected.: 71.00291481501385
Wickham was to      the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it      to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his      profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a      valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became      vacant.: 86.35184537883063
He is so excessively handsome!: 287.9819652983966
This will never do."  "You need not distress yourself.: 33.335629648279365
His character is thereby complete."  "I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.: 37.287920768352386
Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.: 48.6446796653161
"For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her.: 42.06077829913216
With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr.: 81.59244511090755
Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr.: 15.095809811105198
She liked him too little to care for his approbation.: 100.09339447594736
"He must be an oddity, I think," said she.: 12.585565530779022
Mr.: 1.0161809015065533
I wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you!: 61.03449876166639
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.: 37.78934854298071
Egerton, Military Library, Whitehall.: 61.7304930937235
Elizabeth was delighted.: 1.9025821293480072
Where shall you change horses?--Oh!: 916.3311565215475
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.: 48.92529406568661
Bennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.: 61.41757557220745
And when you have given _your_ ball," she added, "I shall insist on their giving one also.: 70.48758015279674
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy, than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her.: 57.2076872580105
In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness.: 59.64562066137792
"It must not be thought of.: 52.378272672610855
"I hope, my dear," said Mr.: 5.2661232781273455
If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough.: 72.84075960317078
yes.: 44.73888184817205
"But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike is founded.: 69.57636419058917
"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with.: 23.624750690003097
Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets; and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_ been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.: 76.29168091537808
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess.: 139.5122758099933
It was all pride and insolence.: 37.00731269309853
Is _her_ husband, is the son of his late father's steward, to be his brother?: 34.68722611330894
However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr.: 84.6460738699853
My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.: 69.9628642920672
Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.: 210.62741858400548
Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr.: 49.61393455266983
"MY DEAR NIECE,       "I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole      morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will      not comprise what I have to tell you.: 41.36581887180299
And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.: 38.7042852794536
Bingley.: 26.849083560709865
Philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before.: 148.23938476712874
But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them.: 104.82489868498105
Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.: 27.676210994062746
Collins's character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on entering the marriage state."  Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.: 48.60486422561799
Darcy.: 79.08172440542967
"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"  "To-morrow fortnight."  "Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs.: 22.331189628996146
Surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement.: 18.959698650285773
Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.: 21.376477738853332
"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness.: 35.48039212228395
Nothing was      to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do      not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your      uncle would most readily have settled the whole.: 49.110045064095715
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.: 34.77900991884944
Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.: 47.00241777569597
Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers, have been in her head.: 29.674725794029886
and Mrs.: 0.9292231826134522
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.: 48.31282039962846
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.: 61.19068630392623
On the following Monday, Mrs.: 58.459942820257254
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing      but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed      him to act as he has done.: 43.46279746878688
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?: 353.2147730275158
Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself.: 96.00136977302378
She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice.: 61.26277028286367
On being made acquainted with the present Mr.: 13.737850186436868
A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it.: 232.91988457050434
I must conclude, for I cannot be      long from my poor mother.: 24.621913960079755
Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.: 65.56682569014725
Mrs.: 1.039363023621984
All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.: 89.60003545078565
Collins.: 31.172643442622945
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.: 30.30858180983908
"There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be?"  "Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know."  "La!" replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with him before.: 42.16200199020202
Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, "if that disagreeable Mr.: 35.44293978366071
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.: 94.66899410566113
And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.: 70.38938629844144
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.: 42.55356938123093
Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr.: 38.47863469104437
She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening.: 42.01718376459915
Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but      of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one      witness of undoubted veracity.: 45.59137926627756
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us.: 107.57016451693745
That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice!: 81.97284721056563
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement.: 50.21092243297809
Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance.: 58.3680434362289
and so extremely accomplished for her age!: 373.51053189323375
The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs.: 40.570395251711325
Wickham ought not to be a      clergyman.: 18.713880865749537
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.: 66.69076974284445
Wickham with money."  "Well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle?: 32.169349701254944
But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew.: 54.35280022822769
From that moment I      observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then      perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had      ever witnessed in him.: 54.17464924823176
But we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger impulses even than pride."  "Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"  "Yes.: 101.56034553090137
I will put on my things in a moment.: 38.4632710419159
Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me.: 21.277141487199696
"My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street."  She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.: 19.707791662529736
1.E.5.: 10.063571188735965
Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.: 104.38334426621887
Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.: 48.91860216236075
Darcy would bring his sister to visit her, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.: 54.095341237549576
Bingley.--It was an animating subject, and Mrs.: 7.583761712185673
CHAPTER XV.: 1.1580587750183466
Arguments are too much like disputes.: 16.27141523245052
Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better.: 51.11507476191789
Mr.: 1.0161809015065533
Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking to send her away!: 39.76203200260423
Good girl!: 13.489732892002156
But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant.: 39.37691983704961
The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.: 29.186440037554565
Of his former way of life, nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself.: 69.64221657697821
Darcy was here when you sent for us;--was it so?"  "Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.: 52.10865155018582
"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin.: 48.12294672722639
CHAPTER VIII.: 1.1580587750183466
Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:  "You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly.: 80.02788284725575
Collins."  "From Mr.: 15.683800963731931
"I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel Millar's regiment went away.: 31.540559294178067
With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs.: 65.1687939337046
Mrs.: 1.039363023621984
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way."  "I can easily believe it.: 17.169383048912497
Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said,  "But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir?--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of offending your patroness."  "My dear sir," replied Mr.: 58.28545332707342
What are men to rocks and mountains?: 26.87987564752987
Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.: 38.868812414356974
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them.: 192.01172155787697
Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come."  Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.: 156.48200074546463
But it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."  "I see no occasion for that.: 23.30006328662
My dear Mr.: 0.48871080625045427
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education."  Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case.: 22.518159614704203
I am the happiest creature in      the world.: 7.7046279754753995
Who would have thought it!: 19.5536796813639
I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.: 128.877628373772
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.: 43.874670363242
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency.: 51.541566438227306
how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.: 37.89649201056617
I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers.: 18.32676598751488
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her, must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.: 50.2376163872527
If there were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.: 43.01395946856581
Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure."  She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library,  "Oh!: 36.510255321236336
Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr.: 22.86977781668847
She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times.: 38.16815095126271
They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas.: 74.7713866214115
1813.: 15.78275054666305
But you know married women have never much time for writing.: 446.8740147149545
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her."  Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them.: 50.88176594031804
To persuade him against      returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,      was scarcely the work of a moment.--I cannot blame myself for      having done thus much.: 118.34943295892539
Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.: 71.04722254268236
What a fine thing for our girls!"  "How so?: 183.37134225970942
Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.: 78.01648093414325
The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants.: 51.82299296204431
The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging.: 30.650390715279883
Gardiner could do.: 2.9346646659712383
It was evident thahopet she was much better acquainted with Mr.: 17.93997620133193
Bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.: 110.42889295026949
No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called.: 76.16937920771574
Their father then went to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.: 12.81978785099087
He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.: 26.46926458584089
Bennet instantly answered,  "Oh dear!--Yes--certainly.--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection.--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs." And gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out,  "Dear Ma'am, do not go.--I beg you will not go.--Mr.: 34.02365529409959
The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt.: 19.800896318590038
Their reception from Mr.: 5.712354655395906
She could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.: 62.77253446521824
Mrs.: 1.039363023621984
Wickham is safe."  "And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune."  "She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."  "But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane.: 40.7414224508923
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them.: 24.936003450687753
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions.: 49.236510286090756
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit.: 65.82382444309938
"Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.: 38.80729829139503
Her reflections were in general satisfactory.: 137.04527104333076
I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it."  "I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.: 50.31900356638873
It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."  "Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."  "I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a studier of character.: 40.65093292597884
They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.: 145.3768939979828
With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr.: 22.86295935217706
or had you intended any more serious consequence?"  "My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me.: 91.98066089707275
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed.: 83.6140719771333
Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she knew not how to believe that Mr.: 29.66348782228321
Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body.: 47.87424711273179
And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty.: 27.34464064443276
Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.: 189.01848915343277
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.: 93.58305530811536
The express was sent off directly.: 15.800111359997755
Bennet.: 198.57784399276358
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr.: 27.380354877817293
My aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing."  "Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use.: 33.49072541084603
But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "Mrs.: 14.705026948485633
Mr.: 1.0161809015065533
"I see your design, Bingley," said his friend.--"You dislike an argument, and want to silence this."  "Perhaps I do.: 84.46087834676054
Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.: 103.74048595145166
I hate such false friends.: 684.6032094070487
She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out.: 34.45600564673711
She could think only of her letter.: 14.360752280287656
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.: 27.484229412699044
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr.: 22.990007289238857
Every thing that is charming!: 186.9177989559687
So imprudent a      match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that      his character has been misunderstood.: 27.37516352018969
I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.: 38.13127654118488
Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr.: 18.093502623277836
You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."  "I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression.: 71.92258285409943
He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her.: 27.878577564777302
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer.: 59.94188883808468
How can they suit each other?--Do you know Mr.: 36.24910941361623
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts."  Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.: 67.09365762070809
Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.: 22.47103878061647
They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better.: 114.17722736640481
Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--It is impossible.: 33.121579953156974
Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?: 206.52115778187627
See paragraph 1.C below.: 124.89826830096997
Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.: 75.4422565887915
He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex.: 83.43109677964362
The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.: 64.08298129037915
"Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know.: 15.143643669629684
There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible, that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected.: 58.655006075698694
To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit.: 55.09988240752053
She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done.: 40.22106365681354
"Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, "and what do you think of my husband?: 21.461688161797188
Darcy's proposals.: 124.32493192025221
For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more      particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our      near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of      the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted      with every particular of these transactions.: 52.50264290667826
If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.: 19.272016038203713
But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is.: 23.82480933203586
Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.: 45.40060327128775
Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,  "My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.: 46.38404636219943
This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.: 40.568732980788994
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.: 40.20199748355537
But enough of this.: 32.34893567039483
Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight."  "Are they indeed?" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.: 37.02497241243114
She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.: 47.65809285630853
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man--he is a great friend of Darcy's."  "Oh!: 20.897572330960045
The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs.: 37.87410632121598
"I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs.: 16.589531141426704
He does not want abilities.: 904.7319631513673
Poor little Lizzy!: 10.995815512942341
At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.: 52.16262541379123
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.: 117.36420903654269
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty.: 107.66948449644096
She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham.: 46.46658483781924
They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve.: 78.74967725047276
I dare say Mr.: 5.635243779037534
Mrs.: 1.039363023621984
Her affections had been continually fluctuating, but never without an object.: 68.18395331335707
Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.: 27.719776167423465
Everything wore a happier aspect.: 1001.2607379488358
Mr.: 1.0161809015065533
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.: 65.5358405766876
Let me hear what it is."  "We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.: 26.13518528484518
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err.: 33.46608470352466
Gardiner.: 31.172643442622945
But against this, there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.: 38.217780176402776
Wickham in and near Brighton, with      assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself.: 33.54793866347469
The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.: 120.4723333473134
If an individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg are removed.: 35.059109631675796
Of Mr.: 1.003163070345274
"There is also one other person in the party," he continued after a pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?"  The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.: 42.835288368495696
Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr.: 12.828168484811787
Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there      proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.: 38.810311541866085
"I should like to know how he behaves among strangers."  "You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.: 91.13729869161664
Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr.: 20.857300016861135
*       *       *       *       *  Mr.: 3.5207729163940598
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what Jane felt for Bingley.: 59.3801396648171
Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked.: 31.626329202034338
"Good Heaven!: 0.6999200930599274
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw.: 111.11472757585837
Robinson."  "Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr.: 46.49313164174144
I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older."  In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned.: 38.58693696388235
"You write uncommonly fast."  "You are mistaken.: 86.2159772909089
Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.: 49.409172694381155
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr.: 13.953496656523305
James's, Sir William was so completely awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look.: 46.66637046850652
Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence?: 22.32884680765567
He spoke of it as a certain event,      of which the time alone could be undecided.: 55.73580897608419
Every body said how well she looked; and Mr.: 19.35706100189078
After lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that Mr.: 40.60453786921742
Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill.: 35.798403106050415
Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.: 59.76607826095858
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility.: 66.66204190492118
"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"  He made no answer.: 36.47737410645219
"My dear Friend,       "If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and      me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our      lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never      end without a quarrel.: 47.05596804541464
The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.: 51.79596863455601
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.: 70.14069999635691
Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.: 44.21971076692365
Ten thousand a year, and very likely more!: 7.687491959313104
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr.: 47.23446686140705
She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr.: 51.06967226002438
Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.: 182.094176883713
Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr.: 59.31681443540874
Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again.: 47.2379269724119
Pray, how _violent was_ Mr.: 25.514022569283775
"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr.: 48.253438326645366
"I cannot see why Mrs.: 69.19799326816226
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together.: 45.49466227666662
Mr.: 1.0161809015065533
Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose."  "Good God!: 55.09624531880636
I should infinitely prefer a book."  But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.: 87.65697029343691
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!"  "Oh!: 31.62231312949104
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?: 213.9813050973903
Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation, &c.: 27.766961596751845
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening.: 44.666504510708386
Darcy said very little, and Mr.: 10.234267115495415
She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before.: 115.56569068319459
During dinner, Mr.: 9.014950208636789
Mrs.: 1.039363023621984
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other.: 69.61697620848516
How is such a man to be worked on?: 18.93966394419705
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.: 121.02726662912902
However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were."  "And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently.: 50.88664616877986
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs.: 37.448729562235464
The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do."  They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr.: 55.693961349717625
"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to his friend within a few days," she added, "I shall know how to understand it.: 25.982319320535275
Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."  She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.: 39.84818095419908
When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give.: 35.882785692880056
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family.: 36.98985398638723
But still he would be her husband.--Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want.: 118.63195058527381
She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper.: 146.11878643319739
I shall go distracted."  This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away.: 62.78099751982878
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.: 134.65521742813937
I felt a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right.: 37.38244490749784
There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.: 40.772670891608136
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.: 43.065004515869994
She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself.: 72.12024843825661
He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have attained it.: 36.30185942245601
Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred.: 359.5782000043151
She could only imagine however at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present.: 73.75080450859632
Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.: 48.831838135228026
Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent.: 98.49154391866436
Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty.: 65.21558666410748
His behaviour to us has,      in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.: 72.88619273192836
Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.: 38.29355317317459
Did you see him while you were at Lambton?: 98.63616719730922
Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr.: 8.42535396927106
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did."  The idea of Mr.: 24.994052532052784
*       *       *       *       *  "Good gracious!" cried Mrs.: 5.236354886053562
Mrs.: 1.039363023621984
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.: 40.868641134185154
Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.--But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.: 47.11902148295868
But why Mr.: 0.2907277874410178
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.: 60.96515699918083
If you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.: 14.044917823919349
Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body, and had so many favourites.: 49.347215723470406
But does not Jane correspond with the sister?: 112.03888936140926
W.: 1.5697853280060368
Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation.: 42.95651269134215
- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free      distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.: 6.063055634380431
He looked serious as usual; and she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley.: 15.584156761582665
Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.: 83.14373931916039
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.: 140.47980695664822
I do not trust my own partiality.: 119.24278631128279
Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.: 79.83406715637258
Could he expect that her friends would not step forward?: 99.73108117894095
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs.: 19.208978666742112
While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for ever.: 61.848172552379495
That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling.: 119.834078233952
In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger.: 68.56143278497565
I am perfectly satisfied.: 6.0443599191799855
And this consideration leads me moreover to      reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last      November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in      all your sorrow and disgrace.: 128.69767448553708
No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it.: 38.09964702788611
Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.: 135.7652814648817
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs.: 58.50954625061408
My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal."  "You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, "that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us."  Mrs.: 25.36841245866047
You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say.: 24.562530280373363
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday."  "Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."  This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley.: 44.74188374873898
You have a sweet room here, Mr.: 83.2385153597263
Why Jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing!: 345.8201614831522
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.: 53.095330190595774
With _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others!: 43.20680635217511
I depend on you for that." To these high flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr.: 50.110116760266195
or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?"  "You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said Darcy in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.: 66.90360401353053
See paragraph 1.E below.: 14.844416405752439
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent.: 73.57446285680619
And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much.: 17.884155060414376
Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.: 66.15899653312144
"Oh!: 1.7297245227319544
Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.: 44.369645641040535
Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr.: 22.018622821476093
CHAPTER IX.: 1.1580587750183466
CHAPTER I.: 797.8051610418374
We _will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.: 118.89617164622149
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr.: 58.74499104035485
Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?: 69.0584987803816
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you.: 39.892481039913754
It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning.: 29.709550124731816
Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come, when if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.: 62.422272351765585
At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable.: 80.66575087388175
"That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance.: 52.027958941196374
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."  Elizabeth could not but look surprised.: 49.428880159316805
Wickham and our poor Lydia      would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for      there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.: 23.09094248908868
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton.: 66.08713898694798
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her replies.: 66.9991325088298
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.: 35.23408191853169
Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.: 229.77115888188277
in every view it is unaccountable!"  "My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.: 13.334578277193868
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations.: 44.69459943936616
who instantly taking the alarm, set off      from B.: 133.79365139539726
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it."  "What should not you mind?"  "I should not mind any thing at all."  "Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility."  "I never can be thankful, Mr.: 33.576433162986525
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before.: 24.13188340914401
He merely added, that he should not write again, till he had something of importance to mention."  "And my mother--How is she?: 36.64803410221749
His attachment to Rosings, certainly increases."  Mr.: 43.46942856368307
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!"  "She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.: 50.06518687521678
Collins joining in, observed,  "Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her.: 23.47908514515075
and Mrs.: 0.9292231826134522
The path just admitted three.: 1028.7856215044083
While she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.: 63.365769861256325
In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgment of her situation.: 47.02792230969297
Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss Bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"  "I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr.: 20.736089977470762
There was no want of discourse.: 25.79265872122528
Mr.: 1.0161809015065533
And his behaviour, so strikingly altered,--what could it mean?: 326.421823784636
Jenkinson were sitting.--Her Ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs.: 27.038970168435466
Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars.: 50.653981446023074
Gardiner abused her stupidity.: 1124.5218779078705
I am very, very sorry.: 28.84849053443395
"Good Heaven!: 0.6999200930599274
She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge.: 20.563180947466883

Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together.: 54.57713941045887
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved, and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.: 67.22807140538421
Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time.: 80.66407561357427
Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?"  "With great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic."  "You are severe on us."  "It will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said Miss Lucas.: 67.83576053744896
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr.: 34.63703822458097
Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.: 47.453708693817234
All connection between us seemed now dissolved.: 76.08089751684567
"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"  "I will make no promise of the kind."  "Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.: 50.05468069384488
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of preference which was often given me."  "I had not thought Mr.: 54.92285658352323
In Three Volumes.: 11.099575627370754
Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.: 191.47869561143864
Mr.: 1.0161809015065533
Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.: 213.9169326378993
Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself.: 27.015408432662348
U.S.: 0.8374635627971582
Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.: 74.98828491093427
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world.: 14.912245965210882
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.: 69.792916863687
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.: 49.09121087152539
I am perfectly serious in my refusal.--You could not make _me_ happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so.--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation."  "Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr.: 46.49246415940318
Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service.: 15.879339681324804
Gardiner was so little to be trusted."  "You must not blame my aunt.: 30.58173403110968
It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.: 332.32293961862484
I was told, that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that _you_, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr.: 37.64564921115564
Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home.: 49.67756686809046
Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth.: 50.704230879464504
I want to talk very seriously.: 170.85068812824048
Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs.: 76.71785852325465
Lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off.: 54.47196872603757
Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all,      before she leaves the South.: 29.131109040044564
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.: 36.65964875736828
You must not suspect me.: 149.93037582428164
More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please than when they last met, were plainly expressed.: 143.03747239185833
Perhaps there was some truth in      _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_      reserve, can be answerable for the event.: 123.87736477451199
I _must_ have employment and society.: 617.8939974796522
She felt anew the justice of Mr.: 17.33493602900667
What will Wickham say?: 197.5758713481109
Collins; "but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.: 92.6731976700208
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.: 19.948621672514083
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"  "You can _now_ have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered.: 54.012935941872
I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real      defect of his character after all.: 64.13616984273602
CHAPTER V.: 1.1580587750183466
But she is nothing to me now.: 37.55170316680561
I rather wished, than      believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to      accede to his proposal.: 37.42543398634486
CHAPTER VIII.: 1.1580587750183466
Mrs.: 1.039363023621984
Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.: 103.82632934960374
She was at least free from the offence of Mr.: 37.76165703616693
Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.: 57.82799389633803
The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.: 124.32115613527075
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope, though you have but a short lease."  "Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes.: 41.94333444667278
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.: 39.4227582601973
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due."  "My object _then_," replied Darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to.: 56.56335678041655
This letter is from Mr.: 20.320957453947333
Girls, can I do any thing for you in Meryton?: 24.37094193622882
Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.: 106.4897505610502
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were      all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was      gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,      with Wickham!--Imagine our surprise.: 93.62594334469986
It will not do.: 15.061395957584566
But Mrs.: 0.8514612911079953
Collins!: 492.7044534412954
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper.: 121.53333373447977
In short, I will do my best."  "Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very often.: 33.15510969111032
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.: 47.496471239065905
He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.: 79.3269789394598
She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible.: 59.08687232496154
I promised them so faithfully!: 75.83340784608797
Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.: 33.98603649345967
From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr.: 16.894689586456792
He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.: 105.01170483991831
She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs.: 57.16808262729534
It was hardly enough; but it pleased her.: 53.66907535492524
All was joy and kindness.: 38.20454916904921
Mr.: 1.0161809015065533
By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property (trademark/copyright) agreement.: 82.77363837800762
"But how did he account for it?"  "It must have been his sister's doing.: 21.8569072688117
Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone.: 182.98250835677936
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr.: 33.006213167493655
But _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a      loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible      flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me      actually married, you cannot greatly err.: 106.12430035571273
I don't know.: 26.821111572766032
She read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes.: 62.18724250058461
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.: 46.586693941032316
Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.: 40.67322541007371
Though Mr.: 0.2907277874410178
Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"  "No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too little said on the subject."  "La!: 29.873896572393466
Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?"  "Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."  "But I was embarrassed."  "And so was I."  "You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."  "A man who had felt less, might."  "How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it!: 46.398668250379046
Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr.: 40.68691563942761
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room.: 31.927961442083742
Darcy.: 79.08172440542967
Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr.: 68.09808532763722
"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"  "Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months."  "Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate."  "If your master would marry, you might see more of him."  "Yes, Sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be.: 32.968711474464364
We passed each other several times.: 39.99590410337181
And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it.: 21.435822404215806
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.: 48.96518312090446
CHAPTER VIII.: 1.1580587750183466
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it.: 78.7966878475505
There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard.: 20.53319821474257
Perhaps I am not doing her justice.: 74.42626373800388
He had found the law a most unprofitable study,      and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would      present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there      could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other      person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered      father's intentions.: 36.85419202823904
My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done!: 18.74560036022191
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."  "I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."  "But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity."  "I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied.: 58.84476262970166
Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days.: 29.150813253130156
There was no arguing upon such a project.: 48.930166981108115
If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy!: 78.426179169404
I thank you for explaining it so fully.: 227.6566818206232
Bennet came from it.: 18.794272646081172
Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.: 52.99816261490007
Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.: 47.889005973957886
She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs.: 49.48113213647113
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede.: 68.0241152001683
Haggerston has our directions, and      all will be completed in a week.: 45.39628045459069
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.: 96.07211458915296
This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place.: 53.33827926038429
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the      intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea      of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as      a father, acknowledged the whole to me.: 66.53832117764752
Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand; but in vain.: 35.162489941637766
I must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.: 48.361003041451994
She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr.: 76.93145439458668
Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.: 58.05479434367323
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together.: 54.70880872264221
This is my advice.: 245.20542637826566
I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you."  Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention!: 53.735724597910476
She shared in their attendance on Mrs.: 14.07968303863899
You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.: 66.0958811524947
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?"  "Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear."       _Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,       15th October._       DEAR SIR,       The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured      father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the      misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the      breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing      lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good      terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at      variance.--"There, Mrs.: 52.93775312987066
If he fears me, why come hither?: 119.72676991889493
She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family.: 64.02625097447557
Mrs.: 1.039363023621984
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.: 68.71289801067623
Oh, no."  "But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham."  "No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."  "But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very next day."  She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham.: 35.59777587858448
Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others.: 17.217801999675626
The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.: 680.940528612502
But amidst      your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your      displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you      consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to      avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally      bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to      the sense and disposition of both.--I will only say farther, that      from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was      confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me      before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy      connection.--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,      as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon      returning.--The part which I acted, is now to be explained.--His      sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our      coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible      that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly      resolved on joining him directly in London.--We accordingly      went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to      my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--I described, and      enforced them earnestly.--But, however this remonstrance might have      staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it      would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been      seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your      sister's indifference.: 92.964742451969
For your sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family.--Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?"  "A little."  "Oh!: 39.08505326976444
And if you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."  "You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan."  Lady Catherine seemed resigned.: 45.07231430127288
I cannot but wonder,      however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at      all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.: 67.14043182912545
My father was not      only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always      engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the      church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.: 40.10985334396427
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode.: 92.05228243920743
Elizabeth was now to see Mr.: 11.276724932114277
Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.: 79.69568736982482
She dreaded seeing Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.: 38.29163900036718
There was no help for it however.: 169.91536470289816
I _will_ leave him to himself."  In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it.: 25.19233808318964
Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on:--"I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.: 70.98993457355056
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style?: 346.58060550932686
But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.: 59.46921811624001
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--How humiliating is this discovery!--Yet, how just a humiliation!--Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind.: 108.60118475398197
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr.: 83.79140121809336
This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married.: 19.698673276932293
I will not tell you what it is.: 24.677256940501675
Darcy?"  "They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine."  "It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with ease, cannot write ill."  "That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease.: 63.543961024611924
This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled." And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr.: 37.01003684650364
Imprudent as a marriage between Mr.: 50.89711384910167
He has given in all his debts; I hope      at least he has not deceived us.: 41.32491383061478
Mrs.: 1.039363023621984
You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr.: 46.976845336923816
Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself.: 48.90583512373421
Mr.: 1.0161809015065533
Wickham's being among them.: 82.44644316591757
Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr.: 34.512488605676275
she was dying to know what could be his meaning"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?: 118.72369868567606
James's.: 45.03809366999921
No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_.: 1080.4658566028902
I have not _that_ pain.: 495.5303043544327
One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn.: 30.536425449992073
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.: 25.278109999070395
Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.: 30.42541158796418
single, my dear, to be sure!: 10.00711740277311
My dear Charles, what do you mean?"  "Yes, all of them, I think.: 9.836935947298356
Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, Sir.--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."  The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.: 82.28175248112485
His pride never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing something for fortune and figure."  The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and Mr.: 90.78324629316516
She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means.: 90.18885535875599
Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?: 90.27353406816489
"How good it was in you, my dear Mr.: 16.943336375206393
When is your turn to come?: 157.36307694746566
She had a sister married to a Mr.: 58.64070792095669
They were natural and just.: 95.40968757135909
and so did Mrs.: 6.559038877435813
Then pray speak aloud.: 232.62229259641566
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.: 98.6266830343092
Indeed, Mr.: 0.9154227343067051
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience.: 59.190069535044216
But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me."  "This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced."  "Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_.: 31.912548216554345
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.: 157.57706090322242
On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book.: 60.635126453811964
Bennet were dead.: 3.906022820278273
The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now."  "Indeed!"  "Yes--the late Mr.: 35.434326918332154
Gardiner.: 31.172643442622945
Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table could divide them.: 42.989997672105844
But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.: 40.436342865485
Bingley.--But--good lord!: 82.05765759992731
"As soon as ever Mr.: 9.532268248527094
Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_."  Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.: 159.21712138060258
Collins was eloquent in her praise.: 12.72426429295656
The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tête-à-tête with Mrs.: 14.438831119975866
Darcy might have done as well."  "Mr.: 14.663821834153318
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness."  And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.: 83.3388178973095
Poor Jane!: 3.8650693800555485
It will save me a world of trouble and economy.: 264.442670896477
Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner."  She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,  "You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it."  Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.: 37.589275570010884
Collins.: 31.172643442622945
Our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character.: 56.24189981821442
Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.: 229.96680124272885
What could be more natural than his asking you again?: 85.17568590906356
1.C.: 5.859034230417409
Darcy?"  "As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth warmly,--"I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable."  "I have no right to give _my_ opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being agreeable or otherwise.: 48.20907855914858
Collins's long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness.: 27.18135938632613
But as it is--you must not let your fancy run away with you.: 82.71114282500275
An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.: 53.218313151648516
But      last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.: 44.837761864775096
Mr.: 1.0161809015065533
Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.: 42.7625561343251
Let me never see either one or the other again!"  Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover.: 104.67521599343789
They agree with me in      apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be      injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady      Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves      with such a family.: 41.220496470100684
Not that I care about it, though.: 35.14600469847894
Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"  Mr.: 63.838834786590425
Tell him I hope he will      excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at      the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.: 30.524235110649947
Jane was not happy.: 147.40926886435057
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr.: 84.76347073609058
His coming into the country at all, is a most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.: 24.306929498210895
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"  "Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it.: 82.72199861070864
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with.: 37.31383382334878
Reynolds was of no trifling nature.: 1126.3082823421637
And what do you think she said besides?: 59.41569040447511
'Ah!: 0.6663285691700254
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.: 68.55386125170439
I will have no reserves from _you_." "Mr.: 11.493960951053593
The first mentioned      was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached      Mr.: 40.35488455277259
He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry.: 97.7770806106384
After a short pause, her companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with me.: 34.51498963030303
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me?: 28.936494921815914
"If it were merely a fine house richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful.: 28.417920233607322
The general prejudice against Mr.: 4.605665585344104
Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma?: 56.94279880133703
After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, "Is not this nice?: 163.59185343435232
It was agreed to.: 32.38691722363972
But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a way off.: 45.0260940066919
Bennet half opened the door and called out,  "Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."  Elizabeth was forced to go.: 10.117872689136789
I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now.: 26.687735532338014
My father is going to      London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her.: 54.78387875624896
He was on one side of her mother.: 11.323942802300087
That such a consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts."  "When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other."  "Not the slightest.: 69.10606428273317
An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure.: 13.15895048284497
Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!"  "Yes," thought Elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once.: 49.05832876862957
She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.: 38.18335035252931
Mrs.: 1.039363023621984
Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.: 11.781605048070581
what felicity!: 492.7044534412954
So much the better.: 1.3219136337459878
As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"  "It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied."  At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs.: 50.754166910860356
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.: 58.83572683188998
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous.: 199.19679607658333
As they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen.: 277.2639209669835
Bennet exceedingly.: 10.375188775758758
I was in the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun."  "My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.: 72.15267794982651
Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son.: 55.85112335103186
You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt.: 62.55763486717885
Darcy found, on further enquiry, that      your father was still with him, but would quit town the next      morning.: 89.82674656550492

I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced."  Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London.: 23.786835617085792
Darcy.--_I_ talked about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples."  He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.: 45.60575621150183
Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her.: 47.115237112948705
Believe her to be deceived by all means.: 19.66558942534091
They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.: 17.542342182315284
In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her.: 56.447540831067535
Presuming, however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.: 40.10229343466811
Mrs.: 1.039363023621984
Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance."  "Not that I _shall_ though," she added to herself, as she finished the letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out."  Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.: 47.41279830995332
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.: 59.29350058913367
They had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had been in the way of procuring.: 39.307740143063654
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs.: 23.97681159369099
But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.: 38.27458646723914
If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.: 39.63916153238581
Kitty, run down and order the carriage.: 58.414690495781365
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.: 39.31446438764253
These were the contents:       "MY DEAR HARRIET,       "You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help      laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am      missed.: 38.57825134851794
Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object.: 22.425614947667306
I cannot think of it without abhorrence."  "We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening," said Elizabeth.: 70.32524226143057
Hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr.: 86.16184457614118
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.: 54.80346411010485
They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance.: 52.02220046413095
She cared for none      of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of      leaving Wickham.: 39.81947664006238
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.--Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.: 104.30652454209225
Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs.: 156.6027172244718
Mrs.: 1.039363023621984
But I think Mr.: 8.035163400243185
There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much.: 52.112150910005504
Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct, I am sure.: 53.32844667508306
As they drove to Mr.: 8.362696350236638
Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,  "I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.: 23.88840788432609
"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.: 33.027764340064216
"Oh!: 1.7297245227319544
Have you never happened to see her there?"  She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.: 20.50737366125553
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.: 42.97247718437839

Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.: 77.14131778292803
She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience was severe.: 60.84584436433149
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned.: 73.27786175026857
and Mrs.: 0.9292231826134522
Mrs.: 1.039363023621984
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it.: 26.067045918287413
They are gone off together from Brighton.: 141.80167094838737
"Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room."  She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held.: 38.42115095250136
Mrs.: 1.039363023621984
Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family.: 73.72702601227608
She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome.: 128.7144471025891
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character.: 23.2532798041453
The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the door.: 44.675194508234625
And, above all things, keep Mr.: 45.373867375332104
My father supported him at school, and      afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own      father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have      been unable to give him a gentleman's education.: 59.254742755349774
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.: 14.663582106400368
He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him."  On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,  "Did not you think, Mr.: 37.95401869988747
Newby      Chief Executive and Director      gbnewby@pglaf.org  Section 4.: 12.541128959907342
No, no--I feel he may defy us there.: 81.25864112193
In as short a time as Mr.: 33.08147199256984
His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.: 32.618201198645046
Mr.: 1.0161809015065533
The reason why all this was to be done by him      alone, was such as I have given above.: 22.372334125374202
There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.: 8.464462020900758
Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.: 72.40171706479484
As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents.: 57.35304024507015
Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself.: 39.57294764587991
You must contrive to send somebody.: 131.6746610576453
She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished.: 203.44984677619968
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.: 86.76550510510958
But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."  "If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your representation of all this, might make me quite easy.: 37.98278792266381
Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife."  "Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had.: 48.24670542714519
Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs.: 8.254137212965997
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.: 70.32343645689062
But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back, she should think herself very ill used.: 50.80010235290303
Will you tell me how long you have loved him?"  "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.: 40.89439909985349
As for their mother, Mr.: 9.145280639128558
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks.: 139.99793553179367
There was too much to be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects.: 39.52451177710863
"You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be completely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire."  "Oh!: 110.61261250535104
"My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else!: 20.27526554626955
Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all?: 21.369082797999784
Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.: 39.53199857055548
That is the place to get husbands.: 54.6835124983549
James's?"  "Never, sir."  "Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"  "It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it."  "You have a house in town, I conclude?"  Mr.: 31.623920414562182

Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.: 131.32986199483489
Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here, what he really is.: 39.370501062868655
And poor Mr.: 0.2907277874410178
Wickham himself?"  "No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton."  "This account then is what he has received from Mr.: 35.87230764766782
But I was not then      master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.: 60.84934292933502
The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to      say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are      discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.: 29.937709442301504
If there _were_ but such another man for you!"  "If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you.: 40.627277378503116
Mrs.: 1.039363023621984
I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy."  To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr.: 110.16570921122215
They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.: 135.1254171697979
Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way.: 58.05379993857787
If, indeed, it should be so!: 19.164966608694485
CHAPTER XIX.: 1.1580587750183466

Mr.: 1.0161809015065533
Darcy.: 79.08172440542967
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.: 58.282887309277044
Darcy might leave the country, but that _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week.: 62.2050309003126
Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in      defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,      ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr.: 46.71963914775327
Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr.: 10.927276779814267
Mrs.: 1.039363023621984
Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,  "I did not know before that you ever walked this way."  "I have been making the tour of the Park," he replied, "as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage.: 41.70994803447987
"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of the ball.: 47.15390672469622
"And is this all?" cried Elizabeth.: 50.448204469010804
Mr.: 1.0161809015065533
There is one point, on which I want your advice.: 38.55036122318615
I am most seriously displeased."  Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.: 56.2821925187691
The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.: 81.51665532567296
She finds Miss Pope a treasure.: 21.679847268983522
You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence which was no less his due than his desert.: 93.82958811229787
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.: 40.04876467502983
But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from the want of money.: 66.4370884613127
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.: 50.06490670062963
His plan did not vary on seeing them.--Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice.: 79.78000103220197
By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr.: 31.811658729959472
Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.: 84.76586387623647
"Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman."  "Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it."  "Oh!: 31.852878459870404
The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.: 56.34763811902842
She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.: 131.58872734541114
Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.: 43.37997624939661
It mortifies me.: 10.189464878226854
Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet.: 42.830120871612024
Mrs.: 1.039363023621984
She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you.: 48.41886715593028
Your's, &c.: 3.9158533912490308
Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.: 81.22798904864196
"I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs.: 9.034450005029656
"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs.: 26.306610552851314
Mr.: 1.0161809015065533
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."  "But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?"  "You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth, "and if upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him."  "How can you talk so?"--said Jane faintly smiling,--"You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate."  "I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion."  "But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required.: 60.23323002713273
my sweetest Lizzy!: 10.995815512942341
Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other.: 31.056199580981165
Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.: 69.86589524595207
I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared      something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock      is over, shall I own that I long for your return?: 84.01599264314534
Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.: 53.81846070454962
You will be a very happy woman."  Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.: 43.27376574696703
If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.: 24.41241421120519
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable.: 48.01717836727838
Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post.: 40.9281230059144
Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me.: 29.115373623241418
He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."  "Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.: 53.19736657525981
In understanding Darcy was the superior.: 61.64763586299679
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away.: 142.70974803488863
Bennet, "you will wait on him of course."  "No, no.: 24.839514082898035
They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to.: 63.00185142764349
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.: 70.86109528349995
Bingley and his sisters."  Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.: 14.519930460434255
Since her father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education."  After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying,  "I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr.: 37.68830287295444
(Robert William) Chapman   This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.: 76.83228848501456
Indeed he has no improper pride.: 33.47009419656602
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.: 10.681912004057768
Darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse."  It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.: 38.66970817324539
My kind friends will      not hear of my returning home till I am better.: 83.4232057498813
Forster called her, and they were going to the camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public.: 70.09732422913532
CHAPTER XVII.: 1.1580587750183466
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.: 82.19103138843664
1.E.9.: 2.6854170886805284
the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her, which would admit of a chair.: 63.69278941163216
CHAPTER XIX.: 1.1580587750183466
Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,  "But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer.: 23.876618611366695
When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.--Elizabeth's courage did not fail her.: 36.014786294944344
It is because he will not give himself the trouble."  "I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy, "of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.: 39.517990514384074
He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.: 80.7141185559128
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"  Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.: 45.76201672253639
Did you see it?"  Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.: 84.28610517398307
To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he _did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something about Mr.: 82.7884111591152
If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him, except a few presents.: 44.737879310683766
Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long."  "You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr.: 57.44053083755136
Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.: 95.9594684641468
He drew a chair near her.: 464.8456764622389
Bingley does not know Mr.: 5.704295514477677
Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable.: 107.66423640062646
I am extremely      glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at      Hunsford.: 78.76768767276053
Oh!: 1.9503150813050942
I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at civility, I am thus rejected.: 80.21712676208374
"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he.: 35.48288959272097
Darcy.: 79.08172440542967
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing.--Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life.: 102.2385172369662
All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her again.: 101.83342530604227
As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters.: 46.47333238174763
She would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable.: 95.64908249920649
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too!: 154.40110339847053
It is from my cousin, Mr.: 14.81471409867778
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces.: 68.68851476326765
It was very little less.: 121.56676773646831
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.: 46.20404935238436
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.: 19.872347429618618
no, no, this is not likely.: 18.270296539394682
Darcy_, you see, is the man!: 47.91095437529209
If I wished to think slightingly of any body's children, it should not be of my own however."  "If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it."  "Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."  "This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.: 32.41946569569635
If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the least.: 78.64051531656612
She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks."  "But not before they went to Brighton?"  "No, I believe not."  "And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself?: 26.663835104846527
I was never more annoyed!: 73.39935364740192
It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed,  "How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr.: 51.21541432255839
Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.: 40.634689596360296
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.: 71.56093643408062
It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.: 60.13599243409208
His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade      her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her      friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,      offering his assistance, as far as it would go.: 40.40503340061605
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.: 47.79854217921149
Bingley is coming down, sister," (for Mrs.: 91.41604699233207
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves.: 54.5772346254297
But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr.: 64.42216259389558
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended.: 480.56602256348845
Are the others coming out?"  "I do not know.: 19.710744832530626
"I never heard any thing so abominable.: 82.36194050141721
He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal."  "True.: 37.867727336935374
Bingley in consequence of it, before _they_ did.: 70.08051436918042
The gentlemen did approach; and when Mr.: 40.47637903887971
Why must _she_ be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold?: 63.87842873752805
Gardiner?: 908.1940298507465
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.: 102.12320262497913
You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty.: 59.58669405168931
dear me!: 3.7508057835629813
CHAPTER XVI.: 1.1580587750183466
That he has neither integrity nor honour.: 494.14536980219765
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs.: 40.048141192453585
He has also _brotherly_ pride, which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers."  "What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?"  He shook his head.--"I wish I could call her amiable.: 55.707727830709544
Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.: 26.793272976610204

Jane was distressed.: 0.8787314865687161
Bennet and Mrs.: 0.35917355816432883
By the Author of "Sense and Sensibility."  VOL.: 53.30192022665519
"No; but it must be done soon."  Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote.: 52.52333044260728
Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"  Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.: 63.535214690841975
They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.: 107.92414274272033
I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.: 57.018162663179574
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances:--and to have Mr.: 298.6340128589019
She looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.: 13.09895431374152
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country." He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.: 48.75973113249718
When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs.: 10.292537031435213
Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr.: 61.11444517689985
Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least.: 26.22673638345174
And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing.: 60.404399141689
His doing so drew her notice.: 282.27954903369647
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.: 46.949127933552845
Mr.: 1.0161809015065533
I often tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired, without constant practice.: 152.75154351413454
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that corps.: 39.9602949037486
She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung.: 33.48041292563449
Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.--The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be otherwise explained.: 57.79451696654294
You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas.: 28.9871437081794
The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary.: 25.706473439088104
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh.: 2.045795227520612
Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.: 52.03648935183869
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister.: 92.87889805608383
It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations.: 53.07612301215878
And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission!: 85.57504453450264
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house.: 31.283836970089617
_My_ affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever."  Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances.: 79.3790195690102
We had better not mention it.: 18.253917376965866
The promised letter of thanks from Mr.: 12.445897125517014
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both.: 65.29396924253885
Their society can afford no pleasure, that will atone for such wretchedness as this!: 35.95847914287753
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out.: 93.15337651348193
It was a fortnight since Mrs.: 91.10288591502919
With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations.: 60.2304642909639
Bingley, and under your orders."  "Oh!: 16.2978853198629
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.: 43.671432643880564
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.: 39.623082760274166
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return, brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.: 41.401272641981855
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week.: 77.47088782171349
Bennet.: 198.57784399276358
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs.: 34.36540536559218
These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber.: 45.10076204160399
Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.: 47.81905049707224
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition."  "Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."  "Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"  Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a moment's deliberation,  "I am not."  Lady Catherine seemed pleased.: 45.059287983986884
At such a time, much might have been said, and silence was very awkward.: 56.106378385233405
The very last evening was spent there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.: 46.327243014488694
He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security.: 444.88713230210726
I am afraid you will be angry."  "My dearest sister, now _be_ be serious.: 20.429492630220697
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr.: 27.77464769813295
This however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors.: 50.8349459626841
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner.: 14.737318850570329
I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married.: 32.56968915036179
Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.: 70.70198188572937
Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.: 57.080467265146744
Bennet replied that he had not.: 19.739081329496393
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expence.--"He is now gone into the army," she added, "but I am afraid he has turned out very wild."  Mrs.: 28.150923209204738
That lady I suppose is your mother."  Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.: 35.512519819083884
Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs.: 72.96215236928215
Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,  "Engaged to Mr.: 45.685276123994846
Oh, sister!: 88.86472915679552
