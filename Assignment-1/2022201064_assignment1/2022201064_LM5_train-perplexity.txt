PRIDE & PREJUDICE.




CHAPTER I.


It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
property of some one or other of their daughters.

"My dear Mr.<eos>: 67.49528539440605
Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last?"

Mr.<eos>: 65.1678797271065
Bennet replied that he had not.

"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs.<eos>: 21.30594164585212
Long has just been here, and she
told me all about it."

Mr.<eos>: 31.408074728154396
Bennet made no answer.

"Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.

"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."

This was invitation enough.

"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs.<eos>: 33.44519848996592
Long says that Netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with Mr.<eos>: 51.40719148975004
Morris immediately; that he is
to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week."

"What is his name?"

"Bingley."

"Is he married or single?"

"Oh!<eos>: 46.24127488863203
single, my dear, to be sure!<eos>: 20.37668539722288
A single man of large fortune; four
or five thousand a year.<eos>: 83.96017763642963
What a fine thing for our girls!"

"How so?<eos>: 65.38187194650216
how can it affect them?"

"My dear Mr.<eos>: 13.272506436340173
Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome!<eos>: 13.129078654359915
You
must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."

"Is that his design in settling here?"

"Design!<eos>: 42.025317869107965
nonsense, how can you talk so!<eos>: 43.05667595478535
But it is very likely that he
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes."

"I see no occasion for that.<eos>: 43.36239850954163
You and the girls may go, or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
as handsome as any of them, Mr.<eos>: 50.214593967801704
Bingley might like you the best of the
party."

"My dear, you flatter me.<eos>: 23.32443560799618
I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now.<eos>: 34.19552332941769
When a woman has
five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own
beauty."

"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."

"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr.<eos>: 61.007132653583106
Bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood."

"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."

"But consider your daughters.<eos>: 30.18634026897319
Only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them.<eos>: 31.997487062878132
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,
merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new
comers.<eos>: 102.42310783679429
Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit
him, if you do not."

"You are over scrupulous surely.<eos>: 28.239493000514443
I dare say Mr.<eos>: 8.326318176710187
Bingley will be very
glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though
I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."

"I desire you will do no such thing.<eos>: 56.759457884252996
Lizzy is not a bit better than the
others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
good humoured as Lydia.<eos>: 39.77792205333494
But you are always giving _her_ the
preference."

"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters."

"Mr.<eos>: 61.92936542337929
Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?<eos>: 31.46545385469262
You take
delight in vexing me.<eos>: 50.97466343527721
You have no compassion on my poor nerves."

"You mistake me, my dear.<eos>: 34.0133468413025
I have a high respect for your nerves.<eos>: 32.048466077904905
They
are my old friends.<eos>: 36.23270419752089
I have heard you mention them with consideration
these twenty years at least."

"Ah!<eos>: 72.09225974542328
you do not know what I suffer."

"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."

"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not
visit them."

"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
all."

Mr.<eos>: 49.4265068187539
Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.<eos>: 46.42943622815522
_Her_ mind
was less difficult to develope.<eos>: 27.86339869891892
She was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper.<eos>: 83.84826628862315
When she was discontented she
fancied herself nervous.<eos>: 33.903760229218584
The business of her life was to get her
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.




CHAPTER II.


Mr.<eos>: 35.58324923433717
Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.<eos>: 48.832154546876055
Bingley.<eos>: 3.141442750138888
He
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid, she had no knowledge of it.<eos>: 38.75671244139037
It was then disclosed in the following
manner.<eos>: 19.901438433620573
Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with,

"I hope Mr.<eos>: 34.21139504813564
Bingley will like it Lizzy."

"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr.<eos>: 35.430431150648765
Bingley likes," said her mother
resentfully, "since we are not to visit."

"But you forget, mama," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that Mrs.<eos>: 18.607953589389385
Long has promised to introduce him."

"I do not believe Mrs.<eos>: 20.316442180387103
Long will do any such thing.<eos>: 36.54631500339887
She has two nieces
of her own.<eos>: 25.83508800037198
She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
of her."

"No more have I," said Mr.<eos>: 38.92087548140977
Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you."

Mrs.<eos>: 18.509895952257427
Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.

"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake!<eos>: 45.32054503974112
Have a little
compassion on my nerves.<eos>: 24.956927274115618
You tear them to pieces."

"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times
them ill."

"I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully.

"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"

"To-morrow fortnight."

"Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs.<eos>: 29.721957289556823
Long does not come back
till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
for she will not know him herself."

"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
Mr.<eos>: 32.161357449048225
Bingley to _her_."

"Impossible, Mr.<eos>: 23.43808187678083
Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teazing?"

"I honour your circumspection.<eos>: 43.398442510522145
A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly
very little.<eos>: 39.46112579938088
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight.<eos>: 42.41366834426382
But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after
all, Mrs.<eos>: 67.23702645083539
Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as
she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
take it on myself."

The girls stared at their father.<eos>: 64.98825755869521
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet said only, "Nonsense,
nonsense!"

"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he.<eos>: 32.99592550258031
"Do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense?<eos>: 34.64560513051809
I cannot quite agree with you _there_.<eos>: 87.69189531229064
What say you,
Mary?<eos>: 33.295470476583766
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great
books, and make extracts."

Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.

"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr.
Bingley."

"I am sick of Mr.<eos>: 70.29257222528615
Bingley," cried his wife.

"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before?<eos>: 23.508433701223634
If I
had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on
him.<eos>: 37.08518000814749
It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now."

The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while.

"How good it was in you, my dear Mr.<eos>: 50.833211900423294
Bennet!<eos>: 5.8674808919766
But I knew I should
persuade you at last.<eos>: 29.92399738097819
I was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance.<eos>: 67.31645686894505
Well, how pleased I am!<eos>: 67.35417772579457
and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said
a word about it till now."

"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr.<eos>: 33.060862286721246
Bennet; and,
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.

"What an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was
shut.<eos>: 35.001645680331414
"I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
or me either, for that matter.<eos>: 50.015459784165046
At our time of life, it is not so
pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but
for your sakes, we would do any thing.<eos>: 50.739279469274976
Lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, I dare say Mr.<eos>: 26.617642538716595
Bingley will dance with you at the next
ball."

"Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the
youngest, I'm the tallest."

The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return Mr.<eos>: 34.514274806024495
Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner.




CHAPTER III.


Not all that Mrs.<eos>: 21.04072350033363
Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of Mr.<eos>: 46.79090087899018
Bingley.<eos>: 3.141442750138888
They attacked him
in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour
Lady Lucas.<eos>: 41.95080768585594
Her report was highly favourable.<eos>: 60.65371439285386
Sir William had been
delighted with him.<eos>: 16.161768926941317
He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party.<eos>: 46.62546532580388
Nothing could be more delightful!<eos>: 38.428127494848304
To be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of Mr.<eos>: 58.18374520911046
Bingley's heart were entertained.

"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,"
said Mrs.<eos>: 35.528174034676915
Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well
married, I shall have nothing to wish for."

In a few days Mr.<eos>: 40.101984295483796
Bingley returned Mr.<eos>: 13.109002621911017
Bennet's visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library.<eos>: 31.61810000914373
He had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
much; but he saw only the father.<eos>: 60.290857038437764
The ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.

An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had
Mrs.<eos>: 39.72488968527905
Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.<eos>: 44.31220463643925
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
accept the honour of their invitation, &c.<eos>: 28.178442986608566
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet was quite
disconcerted.<eos>: 11.312323994662755
She could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.<eos>: 49.03166583979174
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a
little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a
large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr.<eos>: 47.952559135016905
Bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought
only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin.<eos>: 79.11573848898206
And when
the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five
altogether; Mr.<eos>: 73.99356031856392
Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
another young man.

Mr.<eos>: 37.7567444863818
Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.<eos>: 87.18348613949536
His sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion.<eos>: 64.00820612630159
His brother-in-law, Mr.<eos>: 17.657900436334938
Hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr.<eos>: 45.298421334696144
Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.<eos>: 74.1693760877159
The gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
much handsomer than Mr.<eos>: 30.922511339141998
Bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend.

Mr.<eos>: 47.78849843302776
Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
himself at Netherfield.<eos>: 69.08292883676991
Such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves.<eos>: 46.26156983434102
What a contrast between him and his friend!<eos>: 24.20473340272598
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy danced
only once with Mrs.<eos>: 33.76453219576313
Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
His character was decided.<eos>: 56.36043354394543
He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs.<eos>: 48.01568632515779
Bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his
having slighted one of her daughters.

Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.<eos>: 47.38883666243609
Darcy had been
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and
Mr.<eos>: 37.192699689617115
Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his
friend to join it.

"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance.<eos>: 23.124984481147283
I hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.<eos>: 52.72958303244186
You had much better
dance."

"I certainly shall not.<eos>: 40.69690162009276
You know how I detest it, unless I am
particularly acquainted with my partner.<eos>: 29.06059028233991
At such an assembly as this, it
would be insupportable.<eos>: 20.511109712925833
Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with."

"I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Bingley, "for a
kingdom!<eos>: 26.2516520506051
Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my
life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty."

"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr.
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.

"Oh!<eos>: 53.40891767126205
she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!<eos>: 51.522088540901166
But there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
dare say, very agreeable.<eos>: 63.77785974569669
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you."

"Which do you mean?" and turning round, he looked for a moment at
Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said,
"She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men.<eos>: 62.112361721312844
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."

Mr.<eos>: 62.917387519226054
Bingley followed his advice.<eos>: 24.52829314954848
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.<eos>: 35.52451965744207
She told the story
however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.

The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.<eos>: 63.17188375884423
Mrs.
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
party.<eos>: 33.798322749763436
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sisters.<eos>: 23.639976154683364
Jane was as much gratified by this, as her
mother could be, though in a quieter way.<eos>: 31.519128943298846
Elizabeth felt Jane's
pleasure.<eos>: 19.72356916339168
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball.<eos>: 45.222475657421725
They returned therefore in good
spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants.<eos>: 46.873002217093514
They found Mr.<eos>: 8.539466409071688
Bennet still up.<eos>: 35.12799845859978
With a
book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations.<eos>: 48.470121830759766
He had rather hoped that all his wife's
views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he
had a very different story to hear.

"Oh!<eos>: 34.78579122607789
my dear Mr.<eos>: 6.659460244440013
Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball.<eos>: 38.48103875314389
I wish you had been there.
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.<eos>: 43.26866709896397
Every body said how well
she looked; and Mr.<eos>: 43.93305862613311
Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
her twice.<eos>: 47.80634874511091
Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her
twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time.<eos>: 48.29241223420503
First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.<eos>: 34.045962943746716
I was so vexed to see him stand
up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
down the dance.<eos>: 56.862042431180605
So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next.<eos>: 67.34521023114347
Then, the two third he danced with Miss
King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane
again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger----"

"If he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently,
"he would not have danced half so much!<eos>: 45.2162087090954
For God's sake, say no more of
his partners.<eos>: 23.873636091030697
Oh!<eos>: 4.7344512948191735
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!"

"Oh!<eos>: 16.298716393472326
my dear," continued Mrs.<eos>: 14.617060829390986
Bennet, "I am quite delighted with him.<eos>: 13.71617732853937
He
is so excessively handsome!<eos>: 48.80004717920623
and his sisters are charming women.<eos>: 34.245325842292644
I never
in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses.<eos>: 38.104344782616764
I dare say the
lace upon Mrs.<eos>: 18.691142028275895
Hurst's gown----"

Here she was interrupted again.<eos>: 59.2905016297341
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Bennet protested against any
description of finery.<eos>: 36.70611712807397
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr.<eos>: 41.87195342449094
Darcy.

"But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing.<eos>: 48.325667289000286
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him!<eos>: 85.36114759428419
He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great!<eos>: 55.83521148215757
Not handsome enough to dance with!<eos>: 63.557074879608784
I wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set downs.<eos>: 25.859279620777293
I quite detest the man."




CHAPTER IV.


When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of Mr.<eos>: 24.43089754150851
Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
she admired him.

"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good
humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease,
with such perfect good breeding!"

"He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can.<eos>: 67.08980795435049
His character is thereby complete."

"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.<eos>: 40.009046603896216
I
did not expect such a compliment."

"Did not you?<eos>: 22.34296655116302
_I_ did for you.<eos>: 22.236832067147414
But that is one great difference between
us.<eos>: 58.633599206337365
Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.<eos>: 139.0309147561223
What
could be more natural than his asking you again?<eos>: 37.6401346078928
He could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room.<eos>: 45.136190956974545
No thanks to his gallantry for that.<eos>: 68.36912490649112
Well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.<eos>: 38.79417400653999
You have liked many a
stupider person."

"Dear Lizzy!"

"Oh!<eos>: 25.37560581301453
you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.
You never see a fault in any body.<eos>: 55.19501589683158
All the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes.<eos>: 46.91098451081329
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life."

"I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak
what I think."

"I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.<eos>: 48.35373284976783
With _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others!<eos>: 48.51112595339308
Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every
where.<eos>: 185.72099379720845
But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good
of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of
the bad--belongs to you alone.<eos>: 53.49560768311924
And so, you like this man's sisters too,
do you?<eos>: 68.34950489994786
Their manners are not equal to his."

"Certainly not; at first.<eos>: 61.332847250849404
But they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them.<eos>: 30.04156797763973
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep
his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her."

Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very
little disposed to approve them.<eos>: 49.21150969977964
They were in fact very fine ladies; not
deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of
being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.<eos>: 104.56596079168654
They were
rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private
seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the
habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people
of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of
themselves, and meanly of others.<eos>: 46.59252110268957
They were of a respectable family in
the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their
memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been
acquired by trade.

Mr.<eos>: 37.1926680094084
Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
but did not live to do it.--Mr.<eos>: 45.79868526563759
Bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase.

His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but
though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs.<eos>: 45.948967321326265
Hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her.<eos>: 71.51598780133531
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Bingley had not been of
age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to
look at Netherfield House.<eos>: 41.024606914600234
He did look at it and into it for half an
hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied
with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.

Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a
great opposition of character.--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could
offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never
appeared dissatisfied.<eos>: 63.4302304879382
On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the
firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion.<eos>: 32.15542174236698
In
understanding Darcy was the superior.<eos>: 63.198847823564684
Bingley was by no means deficient,
but Darcy was clever.<eos>: 45.539919086158406
He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and
fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.<eos>: 22.003830367975187
In
that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.<eos>: 63.42487495197308
Bingley was sure of
being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence.

The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic.<eos>: 114.05170666630626
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him,
there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted
with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel
more beautiful.<eos>: 37.28786372996618
Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people
in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had
felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or
pleasure.<eos>: 81.8332268269
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too
much.

Mrs.<eos>: 30.6138620627418
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
they should not object to know more of.<eos>: 52.63406119339849
Miss Bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such
commendation to think of her as he chose.




CHAPTER V.


Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
were particularly intimate.<eos>: 70.73276200235702
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty.
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.<eos>: 53.761681116365395
It had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and
quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a
mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he
could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by
business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.<eos>: 57.719258500268126
For
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
contrary, he was all attention to every body.<eos>: 32.198815177214776
By nature inoffensive,
friendly and obliging, his presentation at St.<eos>: 63.277404580939205
James's had made him
courteous.

Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs.<eos>: 42.97941662407008
Bennet.--They had several children.<eos>: 37.17862653831156
The
eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,
was Elizabeth's intimate friend.

That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a
ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.

"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs.<eos>: 78.05857037563341
Bennet with civil
self-command to Miss Lucas.<eos>: 52.46448687707659
"_You_ were Mr.<eos>: 17.3904600875867
Bingley's first choice."

"Yes;--but he seemed to like his second better."

"Oh!--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice.<eos>: 49.1088335938184
To be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something
about Mr.<eos>: 97.37541538338878
Robinson."

"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr.<eos>: 24.72018568005537
Robinson; did not
I mention it to you?<eos>: 39.101903966893985
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest?<eos>: 47.92459332064068
and his
answering immediately to the last question--Oh!<eos>: 65.43751769712523
the eldest Miss Bennet
beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point."

"Upon my word!--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as
if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know."

"_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza," said
Charlotte.<eos>: 92.24675592114264
"Mr.<eos>: 3.029267563416221
Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_."

"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him.<eos>: 63.19577570168653
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips."

"Are you quite sure, Ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?" said
Jane.--"I certainly saw Mr.<eos>: 82.7797907607129
Darcy speaking to her."

"Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at
being spoke to."

"Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much unless
among his intimate acquaintance.<eos>: 63.04840883457819
With _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable."

"I do not believe a word of it, my dear.<eos>: 29.28410846349294
If he had been so very
agreeable he would have talked to Mrs.<eos>: 28.94816842330461
Long.<eos>: 6.874287073031545
But I can guess how it was;
every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had
heard somehow that Mrs.<eos>: 32.66658901341631
Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
the ball in a hack chaise."

"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs.<eos>: 41.91750116348304
Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I
wish he had danced with Eliza."

"Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with _him_,
if I were you."

"I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him."

"His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride
often does, because there is an excuse for it.<eos>: 33.06517072418771
One cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,
should think highly of himself.<eos>: 62.2747359038247
If I may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud."

"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_."

"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, "is a very common failing I believe.<eos>: 35.5057254135767
By all that I have
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary.<eos>: 50.390360334979945
Vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonimously.<eos>: 79.3293545920376
A person may be
proud without being vain.<eos>: 61.15962463724693
Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."

"If I were as rich as Mr.<eos>: 65.45285058683848
Darcy," cried a young Lucas who came with his
sisters, "I should not care how proud I was.<eos>: 50.437004278922515
I would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day."

"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs.
Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle
directly."

The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
would, and the argument ended only with the visit.




CHAPTER VI.


The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.<eos>: 42.2891041496584
The visit
was returned in due form.<eos>: 96.10098770174021
Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the
good will of Mrs.<eos>: 58.29429687596678
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a
wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the
two eldest.<eos>: 63.256877866436305
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.<eos>: 62.045686942662805
It was
generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to
_her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
suspicions of the impertinent.<eos>: 48.66825609270322
She mentioned this to her friend Miss
Lucas.

"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded.<eos>: 41.74024861723872
If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
dark.<eos>: 41.81241840483771
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.<eos>: 81.80732278932865
We can all
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement.<eos>: 89.10397018100443
In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_
affection than she feels.<eos>: 79.5366316909081
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."

"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.<eos>: 77.6221039161785
If _I_ can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to
discover it too."

"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do."

"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
it, he must find it out."

"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.<eos>: 41.679981623896545
But though Bingley and Jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together.<eos>: 87.56633184922879
Jane should
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
attention.<eos>: 74.23294178542801
When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling
in love as much as she chuses."

"Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.<eos>: 39.93416780448773
But
these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.<eos>: 38.94441623156329
As yet, she
cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
reasonableness.<eos>: 37.41086462166437
She has known him only a fortnight.<eos>: 27.094226063632895
She danced four
dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined in company with him four times.<eos>: 80.5564187286131
This is not quite
enough to make her understand his character."

"Not as you represent it.<eos>: 35.63500351733036
Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal."

"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded."

"Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if
she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a
chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth.<eos>: 47.47836706676536
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.<eos>: 62.28173871059025
If
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or
ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least.<eos>: 53.90007385058701
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life."

"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.<eos>: 57.26127227319215
You know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."

Occupied in observing Mr.<eos>: 48.42795082936652
Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend.<eos>: 27.898480988561175
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.<eos>: 53.64702964376768
But no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.<eos>: 65.2362493636221
To
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.<eos>: 181.65615303226318
Though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.<eos>: 38.51528864878206
Of
this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with.

He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.<eos>: 81.73030065764985
His doing so
drew her notice.<eos>: 96.9105862439068
It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were
assembled.

"What does Mr.<eos>: 31.120031138862114
Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my
conversation with Colonel Forster?"

"That is a question which Mr.<eos>: 34.086386448363186
Darcy only can answer."

"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see
what he is about.<eos>: 61.33882464851171
He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him."

On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
turned to him and said,

"Did not you think, Mr.<eos>: 46.77157332003935
Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well
just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
Meryton?"

"With great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady
energetic."

"You are severe on us."

"It will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said Miss Lucas.<eos>: 61.36972269448111
"I am going
to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows."

"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
to play and sing before any body and every body!--If my vanity had taken
a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers." On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,
she added, "Very well; if it must be so, it must." And gravely glancing
at Mr.<eos>: 47.6356767863743
Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of
course familiar with--'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and I
shall keep mine to swell my song."

Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.<eos>: 75.38545524056416
After a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display.

Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached.<eos>: 64.3872578618078
Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with
some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing
at one end of the room.

Mr.<eos>: 68.78996185360111
Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas
was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.

"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr.<eos>: 62.957206863004835
Darcy!--There
is nothing like dancing after all.--I consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished societies."

"Certainly, Sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue
amongst the less polished societies of the world.--Every savage can
dance."

Sir William only smiled.<eos>: 52.253448996382104
"Your friend performs delightfully;" he
continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;--"and I doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.<eos>: 66.67379176674939
Darcy."

"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir."

"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.<eos>: 36.42694850430412
Do
you often dance at St.<eos>: 28.20243882270324
James's?"

"Never, sir."

"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"

"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it."

"You have a house in town, I conclude?"

Mr.<eos>: 32.73564993282686
Darcy bowed.

"I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of
superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
London would agree with Lady Lucas."

He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to
make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her,

"My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?--Mr.<eos>: 52.93521848262407
Darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--You
cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you."
And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr.<eos>: 50.8671664987843
Darcy, who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,

"Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.--I entreat you
not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."

Mr.<eos>: 44.06466074244662
Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her
hand; but in vain.<eos>: 52.37143843580645
Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all
shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.

"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
for one half hour."

"Mr.<eos>: 42.45601104633941
Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling.

"He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
partner?"

Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.<eos>: 45.91390257708517
Her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,

"I can guess the subject of your reverie."

"I should imagine not."

"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.
I was never more annoyed!<eos>: 41.0300236797182
The insipidity and yet the noise; the
nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--What would
I give to hear your strictures on them!"

"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.<eos>: 64.74213022799194
My mind was more
agreeably engaged.<eos>: 22.173213692848556
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."

Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
Mr.<eos>: 56.093376718457215
Darcy replied with great intrepidity,

"Miss Elizabeth Bennet."

"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley.<eos>: 42.33856931304863
"I am all astonishment.
How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am I to wish you
joy?"

"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.<eos>: 86.2676929443093
A lady's
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony in a moment.<eos>: 50.85245371151441
I knew you would be wishing me joy."

"Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as
absolutely settled.<eos>: 40.9391966353503
You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and
of course she will be always at Pemberley with you."

He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed long.




CHAPTER VII.


Mr.<eos>: 45.725086898142045
Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in
default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his.<eos>: 45.639967748984496
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
had left her four thousand pounds.

She had a sister married to a Mr.<eos>: 33.20534257544232
Philips, who had been a clerk to their
father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
London in a respectable line of trade.

The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliner's shop just over the way.<eos>: 68.01819676278288
The two youngest of the family,
Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing
better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt.<eos>: 90.40385710599456
At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the
head quarters.

Their visits to Mrs.<eos>: 56.792387401858726
Philips were now productive of the most interesting
intelligence.<eos>: 30.263517083148653
Every day added something to their knowledge of the
officers' names and connections.<eos>: 94.30188600291173
Their lodgings were not long a secret,
and at length they began to know the officers themselves.<eos>: 48.61001104582905
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Philips
visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity
unknown before.<eos>: 89.9132531261042
They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.
Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their
mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
an ensign.

After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.
Bennet coolly observed,

"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country.<eos>: 43.088775581297696
I have suspected it some time, but
I am now convinced."

Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and
her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
next morning to London.

"I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs.<eos>: 30.160631675921575
Bennet, "that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly.<eos>: 25.34893455388515
If I wished to think slightingly
of any body's children, it should not be of my own however."

"If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it."

"Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."

"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.<eos>: 39.375714362741384
I
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish."

"My dear Mr.<eos>: 53.09022617991977
Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother.--When they get to our age I dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do.<eos>: 81.2295082340054
I remember the time when I
liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so I do still at my heart;
and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should
want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel
Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his
regimentals."

"Mama," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first
came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library."

Mrs.<eos>: 64.7977712705589
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer.<eos>: 43.97473101491385
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,

"Well, Jane, who is it from?<eos>: 38.5594867846747
what is it about?<eos>: 28.749169550681486
what does he say?<eos>: 28.172907422192267
Well,
Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."

"It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud.

     "My dear Friend,

     "If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and
     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
     lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never
     end without a quarrel.<eos>: 54.38122655662184
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of
     this.<eos>: 24.95024909915904
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.
     Yours ever,

     "CAROLINE BINGLEY."

"With the officers!" cried Lydia.<eos>: 67.95183866895215
"I wonder my aunt did not tell us of
_that_."

"Dining out," said Mrs.<eos>: 28.822876932366604
Bennet, "that is very unlucky."

"Can I have the carriage?" said Jane.

"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain; and then you must stay all night."

"That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home."

"Oh!<eos>: 24.73127314919721
but the gentlemen will have Mr.<eos>: 19.913850025694774
Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton;
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs."

"I had much rather go in the coach."

"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.<eos>: 30.903271866545477
They are
wanted in the farm, Mr.<eos>: 11.977240426869255
Bennet, are not they?"

"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them."

"But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose
will be answered."

She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged.<eos>: 40.46560673671433
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
day.<eos>: 39.01260223029406
Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it
rained hard.<eos>: 90.41999619095726
Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted.<eos>: 35.75771858595777
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
Jane certainly could not come back.

"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs.<eos>: 49.33766691581629
Bennet, more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.<eos>: 46.40200491063539
Till the next
morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance.<eos>: 15.64647895735685
Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
brought the following note for Elizabeth:

     "My dearest Lizzy,

     "I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.<eos>: 64.28982267317997
My kind friends will
     not hear of my returning home till I am better.<eos>: 48.61704089363871
They insist also on
     my seeing Mr.<eos>: 70.20883575488236
Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
     of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache
     there is not much the matter with me.

     "Yours, &c."

"Well, my dear," said Mr.<eos>: 35.30465520284891
Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
Mr.<eos>: 26.162176905972373
Bingley, and under your orders."

"Oh!<eos>: 25.833189679750213
I am not at all afraid of her dying.<eos>: 21.137301126136343
People do not die of little
trifling colds.<eos>: 23.32028666735136
She will be taken good care of.<eos>: 71.26258314490103
As long as she stays
there, it is all very well.<eos>: 23.36593622981367
I would go and see her, if I could have the
carriage."

Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking
was her only alternative.<eos>: 46.01951403171357
She declared her resolution.

"How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt!<eos>: 23.236328276235863
You will not be fit to be seen when you get
there."

"I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want."

"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the
horses?"

"No, indeed.<eos>: 29.364041805517754
I do not wish to avoid the walk.<eos>: 16.008678240534014
The distance is nothing,
when one has a motive; only three miles.<eos>: 104.16622058460067
I shall be back by dinner."

"I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."

"We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and
Lydia.--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set
off together.

"If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may
see something of Captain Carter before he goes."

In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within
view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise.

She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of
surprise.--That she should have walked three miles so early in the day,
in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs.
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her
in contempt for it.<eos>: 48.40132173949517
She was received, however, very politely by them;
and in their brother's manners there was something better than
politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--Mr.<eos>: 38.642983248057135
Darcy said very
little, and Mr.<eos>: 13.089766602012721
Hurst nothing at all.<eos>: 18.956800870880265
The former was divided between
admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion,
and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone.<eos>: 58.658093158370924
The
latter was thinking only of his breakfast.

Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.<eos>: 108.11110188044275
Miss
Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well
enough to leave her room.<eos>: 34.403962526054926
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.<eos>: 55.06207621062261
She was not equal,
however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together,
could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with.<eos>: 81.20512963623341
Elizabeth silently attended
her.

When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they shewed for Jane.<eos>: 51.01655587149869
The apothecary came, and having
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.<eos>: 35.84511377574368
The advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely.<eos>: 43.83303812887605
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
nothing to do elsewhere.

When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very
unwillingly said so.<eos>: 74.6263795426387
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the
present.<eos>: 49.00049694289647
Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
back a supply of clothes.




CHAPTER VIII.


At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six
Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.<eos>: 50.161044453848305
To the civil enquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of Mr.<eos>: 51.853745206937646
Bingley's, she could not make a very
favourable answer.<eos>: 15.54774574642385
Jane was by no means better.<eos>: 29.700294793148206
The sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored
Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.

Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency.<eos>: 92.17467051907175
His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his
attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others.<eos>: 53.44629541842186
She had very little notice from any but him.<eos>: 75.58858893933707
Miss Bingley was
engrossed by Mr.<eos>: 13.962008501942485
Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.
Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish
to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.

When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.<eos>: 48.87597541708137
Her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.<eos>: 64.43798265032737
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Hurst
thought the same, and added,

"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker.<eos>: 34.45112978997599
I shall never forget her appearance this morning.<eos>: 41.00181065735281
She really
looked almost wild."

"She did indeed, Louisa.<eos>: 79.02452642493343
I could hardly keep my countenance.<eos>: 29.03586250111354
Very
nonsensical to come at all!<eos>: 26.72079056014156
Why must _she_ be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold?<eos>: 51.586023238476294
Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!"

"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to
hide it, not doing its office."

"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but this was
all lost upon me.<eos>: 43.71369277644404
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably
well, when she came into the room this morning.<eos>: 58.476416884858835
Her dirty petticoat
quite escaped my notice."

"_You_ observed it, Mr.<eos>: 51.55036863510287
Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such
an exhibition."

"Certainly not."

"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!<eos>: 34.51646826711704
what could she mean by
it?<eos>: 29.920200398907042
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country town indifference to decorum."

"It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said
Bingley.

"I am afraid, Mr.<eos>: 56.91554737687974
Darcy," observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,
"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes."

"Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise."--A
short pause followed this speech, and Mrs.<eos>: 46.92522239707129
Hurst began again.

"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet
girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled.<eos>: 52.98279379159538
But with such
a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no
chance of it."

"I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in
Meryton."

"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."

"That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.

"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it
would not make them one jot less agreeable."

"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world," replied Darcy.

To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend's vulgar relations.

With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.
She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and
when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
down stairs herself.<eos>: 40.02445470058417
On entering the drawing-room she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the
excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below with a book.<eos>: 62.590876630902976
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Hurst looked at her with astonishment.

"Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather singular."

"Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards.<eos>: 30.33934738487792
She is a great
reader and has no pleasure in anything else."

"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am
_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things."

"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; "and
I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well."

Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table
where a few books were lying.<eos>: 48.271462638879804
He immediately offered to fetch her
others; all that his library afforded.

"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more
than I ever look into."

Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.

"I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left
so small a collection of books.--What a delightful library you have at
Pemberley, Mr.<eos>: 56.65990202358617
Darcy!"

"It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many
generations."

"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
books."

"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these."

"Neglect!<eos>: 38.580747588510185
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place.<eos>: 50.96419679929439
Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be
half as delightful as Pemberley."

"I wish it may."

"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.<eos>: 45.54365328872822
There is not a
finer county in England than Derbyshire."

"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it."

"I am talking of possibilities, Charles."

"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation."

Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr.<eos>: 51.75334950071189
Bingley and his eldest
sister, to observe the game.

"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "will
she be as tall as I am?"

"I think she will.<eos>: 51.89457309427155
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or
rather taller."

"How I long to see her again!<eos>: 41.711940461102216
I never met with anybody who delighted me
so much.<eos>: 60.22803699676348
Such a countenance, such manners!<eos>: 62.61089018427666
and so extremely
accomplished for her age!<eos>: 123.36896897877754
Her performance on the piano-forte is
exquisite."

"It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished, as they all are."

"All young ladies accomplished!<eos>: 39.94046233256694
My dear Charles, what do you mean?"

"Yes, all of them, I think.<eos>: 28.546909899887325
They all paint tables, cover skreens and net
purses.<eos>: 24.586521986368197
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I
never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being
informed that she was very accomplished."

"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has
too much truth.<eos>: 44.90941882191615
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen.<eos>: 54.8478165312443
But I am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.<eos>: 47.122750856358486
I
cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my
acquaintance, that are really accomplished."

"Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley.

"Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman."

"Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it."

"Oh!<eos>: 27.200182293447497
certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really
esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with.<eos>: 54.23172327669788
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all
this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half deserved."

"All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet
add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading."

"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_."

"Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all
this?"

"_I_ never saw such a woman.<eos>: 72.39954951733809
_I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe, united."

Mrs.<eos>: 94.76547843588487
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when Mr.<eos>: 65.21068931139492
Hurst called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.<eos>: 40.96808916474689
As all
conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room.

"Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is
one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other
sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it
succeeds.<eos>: 43.42564236156025
But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."

"Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
"there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation.<eos>: 33.76406640259343
Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable."

Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.

Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her.<eos>: 41.511252317045695
Bingley urged Mr.<eos>: 11.434719321552432
Jones's being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians.<eos>: 82.77163445485552
This, she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled
that Mr.<eos>: 22.581179752821743
Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
were not decidedly better.<eos>: 38.4787920298029
Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable.<eos>: 44.14293877583288
They solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to
his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.




CHAPTER IX.


Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
enquiries which she very early received from Mr.<eos>: 54.2743884722348
Bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters.<eos>: 50.611926570782146
In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her
own judgment of her situation.<eos>: 35.47514905429632
The note was immediately dispatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with.<eos>: 59.46996195560439
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet, accompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.

Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs.<eos>: 76.76200704547861
Bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.<eos>: 53.218482042350026
She
would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable.<eos>: 81.83025023048198
After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour.<eos>: 54.700125416780104
Bingley met them with hopes
that Mrs.<eos>: 28.240860234565837
Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.

"Indeed I have, Sir," was her answer.<eos>: 45.50435176893449
"She is a great deal too ill to be
moved.<eos>: 29.70118688923318
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Jones says we must not think of moving her.<eos>: 42.2363925209623
We must trespass
a little longer on your kindness."

"Removed!" cried Bingley.<eos>: 32.85721460957299
"It must not be thought of.<eos>: 22.105186576915095
My sister, I am
sure, will not hear of her removal."

"You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
"that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she
remains with us."

Mrs.<eos>: 36.811671427235424
Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.

"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a
vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper I ever met with.<eos>: 30.152443603090354
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to
_her_.<eos>: 73.44797312191179
You have a sweet room here, Mr.<eos>: 22.39324190104419
Bingley, and a charming prospect
over that gravel walk.<eos>: 58.32846277227058
I do not know a place in the country that is
equal to Netherfield.<eos>: 26.270695406634292
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I
hope, though you have but a short lease."

"Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I
should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
minutes.<eos>: 39.56783055969731
At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here."

"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth.

"You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her.

"Oh!<eos>: 31.25062125651244
yes--I understand you perfectly."

"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through I am afraid is pitiful."

"That is as it happens.<eos>: 45.547912067341755
It does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."

"Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."

"I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a
studier of character.<eos>: 45.62247031403524
It must be an amusing study."

"Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.<eos>: 21.713253208348657
They have at
least that advantage."

"The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for
such a study.<eos>: 57.27443453037032
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined
and unvarying society."

"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever."

"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs.<eos>: 52.92145338544658
Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
country neighbourhood.<eos>: 60.89619055266934
"I assure you there is quite as much of _that_
going on in the country as in town."

Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away.<eos>: 55.657154357792486
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph.

"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for
my part, except the shops and public places.<eos>: 66.1293163841898
The country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is not it, Mr.<eos>: 34.59874552052515
Bingley?"

"When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it; and
when I am in town it is pretty much the same.<eos>: 23.503880956303668
They have each their
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."

"Aye--that is because you have the right disposition.<eos>: 53.859834892824864
But that
gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing
at all."

"Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her
mother.<eos>: 32.49486547468434
"You quite mistook Mr.<eos>: 17.74286463273851
Darcy.<eos>: 5.0362465464125075
He only meant that there were not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
you must acknowledge to be true."

"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger.<eos>: 59.98670548052945
I know we dine with four and twenty families."

Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
countenance.<eos>: 101.08965586036776
His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards
Mr.<eos>: 35.980702191344974
Darcy with a very expressive smile.<eos>: 16.884714980619126
Elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.

"Yes, she called yesterday with her father.<eos>: 53.67914316502105
What an agreeable man Sir
William is, Mr.<eos>: 49.01392340931079
Bingley--is not he?<eos>: 65.44839806150893
so much the man of fashion!<eos>: 43.45964575572743
so
genteel and so easy!--He has always something to say to every
body.--_That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy
themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the
matter."

"Did Charlotte dine with you?"

"No, she would go home.<eos>: 92.08116110524048
I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies.<eos>: 37.24412097863182
For
my part, Mr.<eos>: 12.157350920018786
Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own
work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently.<eos>: 125.56517914741703
But every body is to
judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I
assure you.<eos>: 42.59731989894336
It is a pity they are not handsome!<eos>: 56.077889037692245
Not that _I_ think
Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend."

"She seems a very pleasant young woman," said Bingley.

"Oh!<eos>: 47.830644552184445
dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain.<eos>: 66.62300121604906
Lady Lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty.<eos>: 66.19657657761171
I do not like to boast
of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see any body
better looking.<eos>: 45.717651784468856
It is what every body says.<eos>: 33.98520080625871
I do not trust my own
partiality.<eos>: 21.907913992849764
When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my
brother Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my
sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.
But however he did not.<eos>: 54.97623117140854
Perhaps he thought her too young.<eos>: 61.8186876865898
However, he
wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were."

"And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently.<eos>: 32.700642349299024
"There has
been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.<eos>: 43.17948770527871
I wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"

"I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said Darcy.

"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.<eos>: 52.33551124100789
Every thing nourishes what is
strong already.<eos>: 75.38121342308773
But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."

Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.<eos>: 78.69293721462616
She longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr.<eos>: 35.22713649662439
Bingley for his kindness to
Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy.<eos>: 67.56758490555966
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required.<eos>: 70.33729503124744
She performed her part
indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs.<eos>: 44.336328038782256
Bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage.<eos>: 35.30224168160615
Upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward.<eos>: 32.51863893986716
The two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax Mr.<eos>: 37.474849162072225
Bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.

Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age.<eos>: 78.59252514958617
She had high
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own
easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.<eos>: 51.06911158634288
She was very
equal therefore to address Mr.<eos>: 62.73889141206369
Bingley on the subject of the ball, and
abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.<eos>: 28.027503733303767
His answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.

"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when
your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of
the ball.<eos>: 52.31784364966626
But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill."

Lydia declared herself satisfied.<eos>: 74.69293892437831
"Oh!<eos>: 5.456511083755052
yes--it would be much better to
wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter
would be at Meryton again.<eos>: 60.6382657732627
And when you have given _your_ ball," she
added, "I shall insist on their giving one also.<eos>: 58.260199061220796
I shall tell Colonel
Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."

Mrs.<eos>: 40.55742863139614
Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and Mr.<eos>: 44.69925402506955
Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.




CHAPTER X.


The day passed much as the day before had done.<eos>: 31.972578131375403
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Hurst and Miss
Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing-room.<eos>: 30.857018132961752
The loo table, however, did not appear.
Mr.<eos>: 17.609933556352484
Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching
the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister.<eos>: 44.20392138675762
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Hurst and Mr.<eos>: 5.464339924049901
Bingley were at piquet, and
Mrs.<eos>: 9.103861794830571
Hurst was observing their game.

Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion.<eos>: 77.75774302589991
The perpetual
commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in unison with her opinion of each.

"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"

He made no answer.

"You write uncommonly fast."

"You are mistaken.<eos>: 43.761649038026604
I write rather slowly."

"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the
year!<eos>: 44.419989525435156
Letters of business too!<eos>: 81.96204533610894
How odious I should think them!"

"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours."

"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her."

"I have already told her so once, by your desire."

"I am afraid you do not like your pen.<eos>: 37.38597739782503
Let me mend it for you.<eos>: 21.111352230111542
I mend
pens remarkably well."

"Thank you--but I always mend my own."

"How can you contrive to write so even?"

He was silent.

"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
Grantley's."

"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?--At
present I have not room to do them justice."

"Oh!<eos>: 54.28270021916628
it is of no consequence.<eos>: 28.374121441399318
I shall see her in January.<eos>: 12.781773157455637
But do you
always write such charming long letters to her, Mr.<eos>: 83.08956655855079
Darcy?"

"They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
to determine."

"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with
ease, cannot write ill."

"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her
brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease.<eos>: 58.066612547409434
He studies too much for
words of four syllables.--Do not you, Darcy?"

"My style of writing is very different from yours."

"Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable.<eos>: 47.76129679789826
He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."

"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."

"Your humility, Mr.<eos>: 51.514327116736204
Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."

"Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of
humility.<eos>: 19.778623031250326
It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast."

"And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"

"The indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think
at least highly interesting.<eos>: 80.4099466836987
The power of doing any thing with
quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance.<eos>: 38.35778336302568
When you told Mrs.
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?"

"Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning.<eos>: 64.83441897573013
And yet, upon my honour, I
believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
moment.<eos>: 39.07968383736967
At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies."

"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you
would be gone with such celerity.<eos>: 27.805265353523374
Your conduct would be quite as
dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay
till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not
go--and, at another word, might stay a month."

"You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr.<eos>: 71.16942057580691
Bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition.<eos>: 27.57126024694372
You have shewn him off now much
more than he did himself."

"I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.<eos>: 48.12743014491368
But I am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a
circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
could."

"Would Mr.<eos>: 55.07447566225796
Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"

"Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for
himself."

"You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but
which I have never acknowledged.<eos>: 72.69975477490026
Allowing the case, however, to stand
according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that
the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the
delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one
argument in favour of its propriety."

"To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
with you."

"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either."

"You appear to me, Mr.<eos>: 64.72246606013805
Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection.<eos>: 39.29664133211708
A regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it.<eos>: 111.39682424805682
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about Mr.<eos>: 38.81325709405129
Bingley.<eos>: 3.141442750138888
We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon.<eos>: 80.41393331100078
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"

"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties?"

"By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of.<eos>: 68.04207272377865
I assure
you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, I should not pay him half so much deference.<eos>: 59.52715340697477
I declare I do not
know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening
when he has nothing to do."

Mr.<eos>: 67.03964068667784
Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh.<eos>: 43.83555234789086
Miss Bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense.

"I see your design, Bingley," said his friend.--"You dislike an
argument, and want to silence this."

"Perhaps I do.<eos>: 66.93796586137516
Arguments are too much like disputes.<eos>: 25.684670688090964
If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."

"What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.
Darcy had much better finish his letter."

Mr.<eos>: 32.81863732468038
Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.

When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
for the indulgence of some music.<eos>: 42.79355637244323
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to
the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead
the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself.

Mrs.<eos>: 47.149299690514354
Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed
Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr.<eos>: 73.85536917697168
Darcy's eyes were fixed
on her.<eos>: 18.06897220055686
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because
he disliked her, was still more strange.<eos>: 50.044403508866736
She could only imagine however
at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about
her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than
in any other person present.<eos>: 88.43999629685688
The supposition did not pain her.<eos>: 31.957234678765822
She liked
him too little to care for his approbation.

After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a
lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr.<eos>: 51.465190635859436
Darcy, drawing near
Elizabeth, said to her--

"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel?"

She smiled, but made no answer.<eos>: 40.88716014912349
He repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence.

"Oh!" said she, "I heard you before; but I could not immediately
determine what to say in reply.<eos>: 42.33161040323884
You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt.<eos>: 42.12401253722439
I have therefore made up my mind to tell
you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if
you dare."

"Indeed I do not dare."

Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had
never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.<eos>: 44.61759329995348
He really
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger.

Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.

She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.

"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
the officers.--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses."

"Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"

"Oh!<eos>: 58.62135048962903
yes.--Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be
placed in the gallery at Pemberley.<eos>: 44.368088238491936
Put them next to your great uncle
the judge.<eos>: 121.43808905075353
They are in the same profession, you know; only in different
lines.<eos>: 49.93287079109858
As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it
taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"

"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied."

At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs.<eos>: 56.01232490474787
Hurst and
Elizabeth herself.

"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard.

"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs.<eos>: 30.98897012410701
Hurst, "in running away
without telling us that you were coming out."

Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr.<eos>: 36.30739773906197
Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk
by herself.<eos>: 36.33967488204848
The path just admitted three.<eos>: 54.22619327693288
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy felt their rudeness
and immediately said,--

"This walk is not wide enough for our party.<eos>: 58.78002800186448
We had better go into the
avenue."

But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered,

"No, no; stay where you are.--You are charmingly group'd, and appear to
uncommon advantage.<eos>: 51.83320152293509
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth.<eos>: 14.042535462906816
Good bye."

She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two.<eos>: 48.445262908763034
Jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.




CHAPTER XI.


When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister,
and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the
drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.
Their powers of conversation were considerable.<eos>: 58.04962344281893
They could describe an
entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit.

But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object.
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.<eos>: 61.7032609498538
He addressed
himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr.<eos>: 25.735174994324208
Hurst
also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness
and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation.<eos>: 70.41845777735817
He was full of joy and
attention.<eos>: 52.26257868995428
The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to
the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the
door.<eos>: 48.910371030552575
He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.
Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight.

When tea was over, Mr.<eos>: 52.52733960107228
Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table--but in vain.<eos>: 43.480281936634746
She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.
Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr.<eos>: 27.26229735789932
Hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected.<eos>: 49.072526733327116
She assured him that no one intended to play, and the
silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her.<eos>: 31.553660807516366
Mr.
Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sophas and go to sleep.<eos>: 30.105789188640863
Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;
and Mrs.<eos>: 32.911590784149645
Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss
Bennet.

Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.
Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was
perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.<eos>: 48.51692642592461
She
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
question, and read on.<eos>: 43.86537371703306
At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it
is to spend an evening in this way!<eos>: 39.646973140359556
I declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading!<eos>: 112.39940165541843
How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a
book!--When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not
an excellent library."

No one made any reply.<eos>: 64.58180081308831
She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said,

"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
Netherfield?--I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not
some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure."

"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses,
before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and
as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my
cards."

"I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.<eos>: 52.83022863146551
It would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the
day."

"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be
near so much like a ball."

Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room.<eos>: 54.827157488824916
Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.<eos>: 49.72319150680051
In the desperation
of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to
Elizabeth, said,

"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room.--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting
so long in one attitude."

Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.<eos>: 48.11667725397258
Miss Bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr.<eos>: 33.51274407817539
Darcy looked
up.<eos>: 20.235175415481585
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.<eos>: 59.89631151369452
He was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing,
that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and
down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them
would interfere.<eos>: 95.23129381264773
"What could he mean?<eos>: 20.801843336407526
she was dying to know what could
be his meaning"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand
him?

"Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe
on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing
about it."

Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr.<eos>: 55.698302171517746
Darcy in any
thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two
motives.

"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak.<eos>: 29.825670830224084
"You either chuse this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be
completely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better
as I sit by the fire."

"Oh!<eos>: 68.90142612067581
shocking!" cried Miss Bingley.<eos>: 15.440534685063293
"I never heard any thing so
abominable.<eos>: 27.856823271184158
How shall we punish him for such a speech?"

"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth.<eos>: 40.48052470766918
"We
can all plague and punish one another.<eos>: 43.646301094698174
Teaze him--laugh at
him.--Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."

"But upon my honour I do _not_.<eos>: 51.55180588315784
I do assure you that my intimacy has not
yet taught me _that_.<eos>: 51.29044361317859
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind!<eos>: 49.23875764179959
No,
no--I feel he may defy us there.<eos>: 50.820880987249375
And as to laughter, we will not expose
ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.<eos>: 45.61366567170892
Mr.
Darcy may hug himself."

"Mr.<eos>: 12.216916327148944
Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth.<eos>: 54.29778699304039
"That is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance.<eos>: 44.86583007387978
I dearly love a
laugh."

"Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be.<eos>: 30.384505783050486
The
wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions,
may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a
joke."

"Certainly," replied Elizabeth--"there are such people, but I hope I am
not one of _them_.<eos>: 56.0134252711948
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good.<eos>: 67.11900721476174
Follies
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I
laugh at them whenever I can.--But these, I suppose, are precisely what
you are without."

"Perhaps that is not possible for any one.<eos>: 57.37862474088086
But it has been the study of
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule."

"Such as vanity and pride."

"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.<eos>: 62.022810044436916
But pride--where there is a real
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."

Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.

"Your examination of Mr.<eos>: 33.82576887444367
Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss
Bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"

"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr.<eos>: 38.70032164250392
Darcy has no defect.<eos>: 32.59344614219279
He owns it
himself without disguise."

"No"--said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension.<eos>: 30.419117011908483
I have faults enough,
but they are not, I hope, of understanding.<eos>: 26.144741730520334
My temper I dare not vouch
for.--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the
convenience of the world.<eos>: 54.74624535046366
I cannot forget the follies and vices of
others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself.<eos>: 45.09560338306498
My
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.<eos>: 30.897788153772137
My temper
would perhaps be called resentful.--My good opinion once lost is lost
for ever."

"_That_ is a failing indeed!"--cried Elizabeth.<eos>: 78.8726779204907
"Implacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a character.<eos>: 34.1887423145787
But you have chosen your fault well.--I
really cannot _laugh_ at it.<eos>: 64.81307505542902
You are safe from me."

"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."

"And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body."

"And yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand
them."

"Do let us have a little music,"--cried Miss Bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she had no share.--"Louisa, you will not mind my
waking Mr.<eos>: 56.733926790641625
Hurst."

Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was
opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for
it.<eos>: 34.468669226227355
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.




CHAPTER XII.


In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the
next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day.<eos>: 41.17118068942081
But Mrs.<eos>: 3.9690145366137184
Bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which
would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before.<eos>: 48.75926126041334
Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home.<eos>: 26.46364069204617
Mrs.
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr.<eos>: 35.9877693369513
Bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very
well.--Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged Jane to borrow Mr.<eos>: 88.57574983128393
Bingley's carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.

The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on
Jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred.<eos>: 71.65711594385888
Miss Bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.

The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right.

To Mr.<eos>: 48.58668755427356
Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at
Netherfield long enough.<eos>: 70.51861152878872
She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss
Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself.
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it.<eos>: 62.03889109154908
Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at
one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.

On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place.<eos>: 76.81856035209738
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.--Elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest spirits.

They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.<eos>: 44.89096033816336
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.--But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.<eos>: 60.01106258954465
The
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its
animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and
Elizabeth.

They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human
nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations
of thread-bare morality to listen to.<eos>: 49.89755060598281
Catherine and Lydia had
information for them of a different sort.<eos>: 68.66465260632391
Much had been done, and much
had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of
the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been
flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going
to be married.




CHAPTER XIII.


"I hope, my dear," said Mr.<eos>: 34.041839255065014
Bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party."

"Who do you mean, my dear?<eos>: 42.961951002017315
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure,
unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her.<eos>: 78.43838207785632
I do not believe she often sees such at home."

"The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger." Mrs.
Bennet's eyes sparkled.--"A gentleman and a stranger!<eos>: 52.62221143279964
It is Mr.<eos>: 8.675459021808681
Bingley
I am sure.<eos>: 15.408397205488054
Why Jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing!
Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.<eos>: 42.655209594467
Bingley.--But--good
lord!<eos>: 47.60701798071144
how unlucky!<eos>: 28.593047674416976
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.<eos>: 34.70706329826455
Lydia,
my love, ring the bell.<eos>: 50.22893299411421
I must speak to Hill, this moment."

"It is _not_ Mr.<eos>: 37.671281470673534
Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I
never saw in the whole course of my life."

This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.

After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.
"About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I
answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention.<eos>: 66.73027098285979
It is from my cousin, Mr.<eos>: 17.226321155834807
Collins, who, when I am dead,
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."

"Oh!<eos>: 26.761214207285374
my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.
Pray do not talk of that odious man.<eos>: 33.884012793446885
I do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it."

Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.
They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs.
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.

"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr.<eos>: 50.14673129557636
Bennet, "and
nothing can clear Mr.<eos>: 29.301083295344004
Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.
But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself."

"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.<eos>: 34.51650144195277
I hate such false
friends.<eos>: 55.873120475759634
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father
did before him?"

"Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as you will hear."

     _Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,

     15th October._

     DEAR SIR,

     The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
     father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the
     misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the
     breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing
     lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good
     terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at
     variance.--"There, Mrs.<eos>: 66.7196501389514
Bennet."--My mind however is now made up on
     the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been
     so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right
     Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh,
     whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable
     rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to
     demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be
     ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are
     instituted by the Church of England.<eos>: 58.46294474056955
As a clergyman, moreover, I
     feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
     all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds
     I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly
     commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the
     entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,
     and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch.<eos>: 57.78565987814781
I cannot be
     otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your
     amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to
     assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but
     of this hereafter.<eos>: 68.47110204905886
If you should have no objection to receive me
     into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on
     you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and
     shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday
     se'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as
     Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a
     Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the
     duty of the day.<eos>: 72.60480459139549
I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to
     your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,

     WILLIAM COLLINS."

"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,"
said Mr.<eos>: 107.02058453408132
Bennet, as he folded up the letter.<eos>: 15.447521551741259
"He seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again."

"There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he
is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
discourage him."

"Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit."

Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady
Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required.

"He must be an oddity, I think," said she.<eos>: 44.71883327704786
"I cannot make him
out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he
mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he
would help it, if he could.--Can he be a sensible man, sir?"

"No, my dear; I think not.<eos>: 52.21540404332979
I have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse.<eos>: 29.839451867537214
There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter, which promises well.<eos>: 27.67157141932073
I am impatient to see him."

"In point of composition," said Mary, "his letter does not seem
defective.<eos>: 22.535257899255228
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I
think it is well expressed."

To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting.<eos>: 90.93577785230251
It was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.<eos>: 44.615908266283334
As for
their mother, Mr.<eos>: 13.340738498496469
Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which
astonished her husband and daughters.

Mr.<eos>: 55.36755107141813
Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family.<eos>: 27.902227952278654
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr.<eos>: 30.105010409640094
Collins seemed neither in need
of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.<eos>: 94.53238240073497
He was a tall,
heavy looking young man of five and twenty.<eos>: 78.98159264801947
His air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal.<eos>: 34.14563152201489
He had not been long seated
before he complimented Mrs.<eos>: 38.450751480173885
Bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this
instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did
not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but
Mrs.<eos>: 64.6074368901011
Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,

"You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may
prove so; for else they will be destitute enough.<eos>: 48.74009466424575
Things are settled so
oddly."

"You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate."

"Ah!<eos>: 26.82176365587347
sir, I do indeed.<eos>: 24.34899671030081
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess.<eos>: 45.66486194019344
Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things
I know are all chance in this world.<eos>: 86.16268647821697
There is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed."

"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and
could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate.<eos>: 50.94328694724628
But I can assure the young ladies that I come
prepared to admire them.<eos>: 47.55655533835889
At present I will not say more, but perhaps
when we are better acquainted----"

He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other.<eos>: 50.652220340866805
They were not the only objects of Mr.<eos>: 20.38436908618428
Collins's admiration.<eos>: 10.533548540693001
The
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised;
and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs.<eos>: 23.72162543214588
Bennet's
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property.<eos>: 37.92288755190802
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and
he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its
cookery was owing.<eos>: 49.83017128968098
But here he was set right by Mrs.<eos>: 58.70790170100798
Bennet, who assured
him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good
cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.<eos>: 24.09415747170662
He begged
pardon for having displeased her.<eos>: 45.539023021244255
In a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a
quarter of an hour.




CHAPTER XIV.


During dinner, Mr.<eos>: 52.94275756040798
Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.<eos>: 39.921293452292616
Lady
Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his
comfort, appeared very remarkable.<eos>: 49.73675506777268
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Bennet could not have chosen
better.<eos>: 21.949183657019415
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Collins was eloquent in her praise.<eos>: 13.406872363182778
The subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a
person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
experienced from Lady Catherine.<eos>: 52.291631313908155
She had been graciously pleased to
approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her.<eos>: 26.75366635761382
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,
and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening.<eos>: 42.737688976770194
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or
two, to visit his relations.<eos>: 65.62582674600071
She had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.

"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs.<eos>: 56.53516366827597
Bennet, "and I
dare say she is a very agreeable woman.<eos>: 15.937791252725082
It is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her.<eos>: 83.2408520171303
Does she live near you, sir?"

"The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane
from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence."

"I think you said she was a widow, sir?<eos>: 46.72545067041274
has she any family?"

"She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property."

"Ah!" cried Mrs.<eos>: 34.063305677443495
Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than
many girls.<eos>: 46.88092716205258
And what sort of young lady is she?<eos>: 87.36178673367657
is she handsome?"

"She is a most charming young lady indeed.<eos>: 43.948636905614876
Lady Catherine herself says
that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
the young woman of distinguished birth.<eos>: 82.09305183699261
She is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many
accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
resides with them.<eos>: 50.603623840699015
But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."

"Has she been presented?<eos>: 34.836822032208914
I do not remember her name among the ladies at
court."

"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived
the British court of its brightest ornament.<eos>: 54.88647190874287
Her ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to
ladies.<eos>: 106.0168732345924
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her
charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her.--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay."

"You judge very properly," said Mr.<eos>: 50.2180612360845
Bennet, "and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.<eos>: 27.481179643913745
May I ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study?"

"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible."

Mr.<eos>: 68.14870998913224
Bennet's expectations were fully answered.<eos>: 41.05031040442776
His cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in
his pleasure.

By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr.<eos>: 60.28080190780877
Bennet was glad to
take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad
to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.<eos>: 47.20783119929202
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Collins readily assented,
and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced
it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging
pardon, protested that he never read novels.--Kitty stared at him, and
Lydia exclaimed.--Other books were produced, and after some deliberation
he chose Fordyce's Sermons.<eos>: 67.27801427989644
Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and
before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she
interrupted him with,

"Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard,
and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.<eos>: 41.25815886970927
My aunt told me so
herself on Saturday.<eos>: 49.99643171932835
I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when Mr.<eos>: 38.524870429995524
Denny comes back from town."

Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.
Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,

"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.<eos>: 59.517873601685736
It amazes
me, I confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction.<eos>: 42.96075128502636
But I will no longer importune my young cousin."

Then turning to Mr.<eos>: 40.66777424744731
Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon.<eos>: 21.70749732199577
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.<eos>: 47.43290758454245
Mrs.
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but Mr.<eos>: 22.636339940601676
Collins, after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with Mr.<eos>: 82.95913790161708
Bennet, and prepared
for backgammon.




CHAPTER XV.


Mr.<eos>: 11.878233450854122
Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
acquaintance.<eos>: 48.76860231021876
The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had
given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good
deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity.<eos>: 48.38371248766374
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.

Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.
This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part.

His plan did not vary on seeing them.--Miss Bennet's lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
choice.<eos>: 59.712259872455036
The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter
of an hour's tête-à-tête with Mrs.<eos>: 32.37406677368184
Bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at
Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.--"As to
her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her
_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her
to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."

Mr.<eos>: 73.34635983841976
Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon
done--done while Mrs.<eos>: 68.8440288336561
Bennet was stirring the fire.<eos>: 20.20718408464775
Elizabeth, equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.

Mrs.<eos>: 58.894620200372444
Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before, was now high in her good graces.

Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister
except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr.<eos>: 45.334177209820254
Collins was to attend them,
at the request of Mr.<eos>: 20.177918455734915
Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself; for thither Mr.<eos>: 41.70368851745959
Collins had followed
him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.
Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.<eos>: 41.39907475265739
Such
doings discomposed Mr.<eos>: 7.532580486954715
Bennet exceedingly.<eos>: 15.42684628173471
In his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the
house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting Mr.<eos>: 53.0154895143707
Collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and Mr.<eos>: 23.603103325682564
Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and
go.

In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.<eos>: 70.47464375579607
The attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.<eos>: 70.1199180420485
Their eyes
were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers,
and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin
in a shop window, could recal them.

But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way.<eos>: 54.037789330878866
The officer was the very
Mr.<eos>: 35.94189392600773
Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire,
and he bowed as they passed.<eos>: 63.63247030377202
All were struck with the stranger's air,
all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if
possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of
wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained
the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same
spot.<eos>: 89.68415233761067
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to
introduce his friend, Mr.<eos>: 25.616979458334818
Wickham, who had returned with him the day
before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in
their corps.<eos>: 47.8906975493993
This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted
only regimentals to make him completely charming.<eos>: 57.41210618550327
His appearance was
greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine
countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.<eos>: 62.14520262369339
The introduction
was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a
readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were
seen riding down the street.<eos>: 59.61063232667646
On distinguishing the ladies of the group,
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
civilities.<eos>: 31.15921571354745
Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the
principal object.<eos>: 25.124753466297964
He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on
purpose to inquire after her.<eos>: 40.681146194901245
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.<eos>: 36.853128152844064
Both changed colour,
one looked white, the other red.<eos>: 40.999244869949614
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Wickham, after a few moments,
touched his hat--a salutation which Mr.<eos>: 17.91975930010611
Darcy just deigned to return.
What could be the meaning of it?--It was impossible to imagine; it was
impossible not to long to know.

In another minute Mr.<eos>: 53.513313262233595
Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.

Mr.<eos>: 37.86453561220692
Denny and Mr.<eos>: 8.267097796374667
Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
Mr.<eos>: 20.74816616542935
Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's
pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.
Philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the
invitation.

Mrs.<eos>: 31.009070884198778
Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from
their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if
she had not happened to see Mr.<eos>: 51.652056083173036
Jones's shop boy in the street, who had
told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield
because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed
towards Mr.<eos>: 34.33603170414689
Collins by Jane's introduction of him.<eos>: 23.113731407808725
She received him with
her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,
apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with
her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be
justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to
her notice.<eos>: 42.64234766853168
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to
by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she
could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr.<eos>: 51.15356598217845
Denny had
brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's
commission in the ----shire.<eos>: 21.716214132992942
She had been watching him the last hour,
she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.<eos>: 37.882283127587534
Wickham
appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation,
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the
officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid,
disagreeable fellows." Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the
next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.
Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn
would come in the evening.<eos>: 75.988347559528
This was agreed to, and Mrs.<eos>: 24.503451084793934
Philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.<eos>: 36.2929869986823
The prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.<eos>: 30.694390606888586
Mr.
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.

As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or
both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such
behaviour than her sister.

Mr.<eos>: 54.3343480982798
Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs.<eos>: 77.3730996410329
Bennet by admiring Mrs.
Philips's manners and politeness.<eos>: 28.519190390463947
He protested that except Lady
Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for
she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before.<eos>: 40.64183743236783
Something he supposed might be attributed
to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much
attention in the whole course of his life.




CHAPTER XVI.


As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their
aunt, and all Mr.<eos>: 38.074555415126284
Collins's scruples of leaving Mr.<eos>: 10.435280067601509
and Mrs.<eos>: 3.8891635654619057
Bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the
girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that Mr.<eos>: 37.85614893935101
Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in
the house.

When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when Mrs.<eos>: 43.61815758811964
Philips understood from him what Rosings
was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the
description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper's room.

In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.<eos>: 40.45963103999981
Philips a very attentive
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could.<eos>: 50.59704864062239
To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long.<eos>: 33.29329841775552
It was over at last however.<eos>: 39.42368947702524
The
gentlemen did approach; and when Mr.<eos>: 28.705546271284348
Wickham walked into the room,
Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.<eos>: 56.672768475990715
The
officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but
Mr.<eos>: 38.146973823492466
Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.

Mr.<eos>: 57.12006400176924
Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the
probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,
dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the
skill of the speaker.

With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr.<eos>: 45.90286785060508
Wickham and the
officers, Mr.<eos>: 13.454052039568605
Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the
young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a
kind listener in Mrs.<eos>: 37.28729269233028
Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most
abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.

When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her
in return, by sitting down to whist.

"I know little of the game, at present," said he, "but I shall be glad
to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" Mrs.<eos>: 35.1416730824642
Philips was
very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.

Mr.<eos>: 36.87177837206298
Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.<eos>: 76.04726048979647
At first there
seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in
particular.<eos>: 64.1849338522933
Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr.<eos>: 15.679984715174744
Wickham was
therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to
hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to
be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr.<eos>: 28.665510692700504
Darcy.<eos>: 5.0362465464125075
She dared not
even mention that gentleman.<eos>: 34.52602165989291
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly
relieved.<eos>: 60.2376550283919
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Wickham began the subject himself.<eos>: 36.879458202997604
He inquired how far
Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
an hesitating manner how long Mr.<eos>: 70.00500999891703
Darcy had been staying there.

"About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
understand."

"Yes," replied Wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one.<eos>: 46.013763664822356
A clear ten
thousand per annum.<eos>: 38.81322906048595
You could not have met with a person more capable of
giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been
connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."

Elizabeth could not but look surprised.

"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday.--Are you much acquainted with Mr.<eos>: 69.24756403594073
Darcy?"

"As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth warmly,--"I have spent
four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
disagreeable."

"I have no right to give _my_ opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being
agreeable or otherwise.<eos>: 40.273596583493784
I am not qualified to form one.<eos>: 19.946148323680827
I have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge.<eos>: 54.68849419066873
It is impossible for _me_ to
be impartial.<eos>: 17.613273549541677
But I believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else.--Here you are in your own family."

"Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the
neighbourhood, except Netherfield.<eos>: 56.543380841754775
He is not at all liked in
Hertfordshire.<eos>: 42.732144232854715
Every body is disgusted with his pride.<eos>: 28.464437148700778
You will not find
him more favourably spoken of by any one."

"I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short
interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen.<eos>: 37.92467416037222
The
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen."

"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man." Wickham only shook his head.

"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer."

"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I
was at Netherfield.<eos>: 45.13463291096352
I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."

"Oh!<eos>: 21.805823076543998
no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr.<eos>: 26.422549579868072
Darcy.<eos>: 5.0362465464125075
If _he_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go.<eos>: 62.093588724008875
We are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for
avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of
very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.
His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr.<eos>: 59.68960047010835
Darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be
in company with this Mr.<eos>: 41.89280110111859
Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a
thousand tender recollections.<eos>: 68.0647826745793
His behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every
thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory
of his father."

Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.

Mr.<eos>: 57.67823951051635
Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he
had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but
very intelligible gallantry.

"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added,
"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.<eos>: 63.01001886823528
I knew it to be a
most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me
farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.
Society, I own, is necessary to me.<eos>: 68.10084618373956
I have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude.<eos>: 28.007357070347243
I _must_ have employment and society.
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible.<eos>: 100.55366499722905
The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now."

"Indeed!"

"Yes--the late Mr.<eos>: 62.4934184881692
Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift.<eos>: 36.6166712526842
He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.
I cannot do justice to his kindness.<eos>: 44.05579119362726
He meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere."

"Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be?--How could
his will be disregarded?--Why did not you seek legal redress?"

"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law.<eos>: 48.14715948223899
A man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but Mr.<eos>: 47.86552968782427
Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.
Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I
was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
any thing to deserve to lose it.<eos>: 78.63402192372766
I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
freely.<eos>: 74.96745104567346
I can recal nothing worse.<eos>: 23.242765304776277
But the fact is, that we are very
different sort of men, and that he hates me."

"This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced."

"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_.<eos>: 43.50256827605424
Till I
can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_."

Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them.

"But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what
can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"

"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy.<eos>: 46.552115082949435
Had the late Mr.<eos>: 15.164724402235114
Darcy liked me
less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon
attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life.<eos>: 75.66439584406714
He had not
a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of
preference which was often given me."

"I had not thought Mr.<eos>: 53.07393505508906
Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked
him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be
despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
this!"

After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, "I _do_ remember
his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his
resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.<eos>: 36.35455320338853
His disposition must
be dreadful."

"I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham, "_I_ can
hardly be just to him."

Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To
treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his
father!"--She could have added, "A young man too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented
herself with "And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from
childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest
manner!"

"We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest
part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.<eos>: 59.973748071395185
_My_
father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr.<eos>: 67.75870287907496
Philips,
appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use
to the late Mr.<eos>: 43.99563875413716
Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the
Pemberley property.<eos>: 30.514180877423
He was most highly esteemed by Mr.<eos>: 41.74788381810897
Darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend.<eos>: 48.81304435879942
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance,
and when immediately before my father's death, Mr.<eos>: 32.98063685708683
Darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself."

"How strange!" cried Elizabeth.<eos>: 37.441403192098534
"How abominable!--I wonder that the very
pride of this Mr.<eos>: 49.29232249127582
Darcy has not made him just to you!--If from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for
dishonesty I must call it."

"It _is_ wonderful,"--replied Wickham,--"for almost all his actions may
be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend.<eos>: 68.32696988659707
It has
connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.<eos>: 93.14706058013354
But we are none
of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger
impulses even than pride."

"Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"

"Yes.<eos>: 52.65894457807337
It has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his
money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve
the poor.<eos>: 63.280069156971166
Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what
his father was, have done this.<eos>: 44.5535932282381
Not to appear to disgrace his family, to
degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.<eos>: 46.53195078784874
He has also _brotherly_ pride,
which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful
guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the
most attentive and best of brothers."

"What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?"

He shook his head.--"I wish I could call her amiable.<eos>: 62.16214341264105
It gives me pain
to speak ill of a Darcy.<eos>: 43.99053287517726
But she is too much like her brother,--very,
very proud.--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and
extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her
amusement.<eos>: 74.81796477965088
But she is nothing to me now.<eos>: 26.774278722904736
She is a handsome girl, about
fifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished.<eos>: 69.76953883013086
Since her
father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her,
and superintends her education."

After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying,

"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr.<eos>: 42.09357688485478
Bingley!<eos>: 5.2626967083861205
How can Mr.<eos>: 8.93884187291321
Bingley,
who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man?<eos>: 93.33723361545185
How can they suit each other?--Do you
know Mr.<eos>: 63.90309869057197
Bingley?"

"Not at all."

"He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man.<eos>: 48.72239927207816
He cannot know what Mr.
Darcy is."

"Probably not;--but Mr.<eos>: 44.11299383156841
Darcy can please where he chuses.<eos>: 48.29018157821825
He does not
want abilities.<eos>: 61.6734347736143
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while.<eos>: 52.58833575957195
Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a
very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.<eos>: 43.610720053795575
His pride
never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing
something for fortune and figure."

The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table, and Mr.<eos>: 87.94586895041685
Collins took his station between his cousin
Elizabeth and Mrs.<eos>: 41.46323715484938
Philips.--The usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter.<eos>: 61.39212600273883
It had not been very great; he had lost every point;
but when Mrs.<eos>: 30.299551743555
Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,
that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not
make herself uneasy.

"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a
card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.<eos>: 60.64716630951822
There
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters."

Mr.<eos>: 63.67497115478623
Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr.<eos>: 20.527502290939072
Collins for
a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.

"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a
living.<eos>: 41.9052173329634
I hardly know how Mr.<eos>: 12.621583093842604
Collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long."

"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy
were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr.<eos>: 72.49710100407574
Darcy."

"No, indeed, I did not.--I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's
connections.<eos>: 21.339357835334702
I never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday."

"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."

This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss
Bingley.<eos>: 49.94118806528617
Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined to another.

"Mr.<eos>: 53.839912218162596
Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her
daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,
I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."

"I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I have
not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.<eos>: 42.87881224814544
She has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who
chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of
the first class."

Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.
Wickham's attentions.<eos>: 61.538448607070094
There could be no conversation in the noise of
Mrs.<eos>: 15.577508204079404
Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every
body.<eos>: 32.206701598200425
Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
gracefully.<eos>: 50.98429566215537
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.<eos>: 37.089307368155474
She could
think of nothing but of Mr.<eos>: 31.315454468211318
Wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr.<eos>: 44.22133996984713
Collins were once silent.<eos>: 30.588166222512363
Lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won, and Mr.<eos>: 23.415678406240254
Collins, in describing the civility of Mr.<eos>: 12.499799861910715
and
Mrs.<eos>: 3.8891635654619057
Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.




CHAPTER XVII.


Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr.
Wickham and herself.<eos>: 42.709215053347386
Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she
knew not how to believe that Mr.<eos>: 55.20242990702661
Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.
Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.--The
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be
otherwise explained.

"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or
other, of which we can form no idea.<eos>: 46.429467824579966
Interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other.<eos>: 45.07311609365861
It is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side."

"Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business?--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody."

"Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion.<eos>: 70.61816904932756
My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places Mr.<eos>: 117.31661861072895
Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a
manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--It is
impossible.<eos>: 46.29660327568578
No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
character, could be capable of it.<eos>: 45.34537878036654
Can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him?<eos>: 104.57972864323601
oh!<eos>: 4.7344512948191735
no."

"I can much more easily believe Mr.<eos>: 42.506695494255695
Bingley's being imposed on, than
that Mr.<eos>: 17.88739304408003
Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.--If it
be not so, let Mr.<eos>: 64.17735434580491
Darcy contradict it.<eos>: 14.933465455514087
Besides, there was truth in his
looks."

"It is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--One does not know what to
think."

"I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think."

But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.
Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the
affair became public.

The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom
they had been speaking; Mr.<eos>: 72.99075926074426
Bingley and his sisters came to give their
personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was
fixed for the following Tuesday.<eos>: 67.70127558313722
The two ladies were delighted to see
their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their
separation.<eos>: 89.48489272657696
To the rest of the family they paid little attention;
avoiding Mrs.<eos>: 33.912504508612265
Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,
and nothing at all to the others.<eos>: 33.465730133726886
They were soon gone again, rising from
their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs.<eos>: 61.04439021644287
Bennet's civilities.

The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family.<eos>: 42.4720782514871
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
receiving the invitation from Mr.<eos>: 52.02721035271849
Bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card.<eos>: 23.017214983909927
Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr.<eos>: 32.78779458556662
Darcy's
looks and behaviour.<eos>: 21.36843496272231
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia,
depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though
they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr.
Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and
a ball was at any rate, a ball.<eos>: 77.72354555001206
And even Mary could assure her family
that she had no disinclination for it.

"While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough.--I
think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who
consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every
body."

Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to Mr.<eos>: 56.71922409402199
Collins, she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept Mr.<eos>: 22.74141898371717
Bingley's invitation, and if he
did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke
either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to
dance.

"I am by no means of opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of
this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself
that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins
in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting
yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a
preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her."

Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.<eos>: 44.30925656275785
She had fully proposed being
engaged by Wickham for those very dances:--and to have Mr.<eos>: 103.24334511116837
Collins
instead!<eos>: 23.443205583142145
her liveliness had been never worse timed.<eos>: 40.65087986624972
There was no help
for it however.<eos>: 52.61158808967207
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Wickham's happiness and her own was per force
delayed a little longer, and Mr.<eos>: 33.51825215329215
Collins's proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could.<eos>: 49.494010094108546
She was not the better pleased with his
gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--It now first
struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of
being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was exceedingly agreeable to _her_.<eos>: 75.91171867599617
Elizabeth however did not chuse to
take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply.<eos>: 68.13694646707663
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Collins might never make the offer, and
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.

If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time,
for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was
such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.<eos>: 50.44460643096855
No
aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses
for Netherfield were got by proxy.<eos>: 80.81952559869187
Even Elizabeth might have found some
trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the
improvement of her acquaintance with Mr.<eos>: 45.880115023838435
Wickham; and nothing less than
a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and
Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia.




CHAPTER XVIII.


Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in
vain for Mr.<eos>: 49.36836363639874
Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.<eos>: 40.253717128393006
The certainty of
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her.<eos>: 94.42641345867317
She had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening.<eos>: 34.49223065745751
But in an instant arose the
dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr.<eos>: 76.28044067301305
Darcy's
pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this
was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend Mr.<eos>: 54.21566329192878
Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and
who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business
the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant
smile,

"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."

This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to
make.--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to
Wickham.<eos>: 62.07344092113522
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and
turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly
surmount even in speaking to Mr.<eos>: 34.65945315552647
Bingley, whose blind partiality
provoked her.

But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to
the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
notice.<eos>: 36.39440532917671
The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress;
they were dances of mortification.<eos>: 65.26904558526641
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Collins, awkward and solemn,
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being
aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
partner for a couple of dances can give.<eos>: 111.35870330511828
The moment of her release from
him was ecstacy.

She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.<eos>: 43.592402742422216
When those dances
were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr.<eos>: 49.09882072343175
Darcy, who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
knowing what she did, she accepted him.<eos>: 47.5557745614027
He walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind; Charlotte tried to console her.

"I dare say you will find him very agreeable."

"Heaven forbid!--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To
find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me
such an evil."

When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her
hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a
simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.<eos>: 65.97638812772502
Elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr.<eos>: 55.712961075168984
Darcy, and
reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.
They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at
first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made
some slight observation on the dance.<eos>: 67.69240047460235
He replied, and was again silent.
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with

"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr.<eos>: 65.90721774004126
Darcy.--_I_ talked about
the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of
the room, or the number of couples."

He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said.

"Very well.--That reply will do for the present.--Perhaps by and bye I
may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public
ones.--But _now_ we may be silent."

"Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"

"Sometimes.<eos>: 76.25780006223908
One must speak a little, you know.<eos>: 36.33897506954431
It would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible."

"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?"

"Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds.--We are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."

"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,"
said he.<eos>: 36.750112264032325
"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.--_You_
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."

"I must not decide on my own performance."

He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to Meryton.<eos>: 45.58313108059845
She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance."

The effect was immediate.<eos>: 47.686658212784614
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his
features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on.<eos>: 26.580791226443782
At length Darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said,

"Mr.<eos>: 19.895696661285662
Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his
_making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,
is less certain."

"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied Elizabeth
with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life."

Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.<eos>: 49.41837583842144
At
that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.
Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his
dancing and his partner.

"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir.<eos>: 62.47871183829936
Such very
superior dancing is not often seen.<eos>: 82.40590090463976
It is evident that you belong to the
first circles.<eos>: 20.533929048893977
Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing
at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place.<eos>: 73.84226567248943
What congratulations will
then flow in!<eos>: 119.78832054041274
I appeal to Mr.<eos>: 8.523674930625184
Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,
Sir.--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching
converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."

The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and
Jane, who were dancing together.<eos>: 58.58917173241196
Recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said,

"Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."

"I do not think we were speaking at all.<eos>: 31.032302990326592
Sir William could not have
interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
themselves.--We have tried two or three subjects already without
success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine."

"What think you of books?" said he, smiling.

"Books--Oh!<eos>: 90.56242436719637
no.--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings."

"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions."

"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else."

"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?" said he,
with a look of doubt.

"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr.<eos>: 57.495239687995955
Darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable.<eos>: 45.54712829235755
You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being
created_."

"I am," said he, with a firm voice.

"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"

"I hope not."

"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
to be secure of judging properly at first."

"May I ask to what these questions tend?"

"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity.<eos>: 39.681124589320966
"I am trying to make it out."

"And what is your success?"

She shook her head.<eos>: 21.619578045963635
"I do not get on at all.<eos>: 16.486214433436412
I hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."

"I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary
greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."

"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
opportunity."

"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied.
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for
in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her,
which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
another.

They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with
an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,

"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George
Wickham!--Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a
thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you,
among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the
late Mr.<eos>: 57.09346627050564
Darcy's steward.<eos>: 11.701643638386223
Let me recommend you, however, as a friend,
not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr.
Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he
has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has
treated Mr.<eos>: 57.359636427244226
Darcy in a most infamous manner.<eos>: 14.756504635908945
I do not know the
particulars, but I know very well that Mr.<eos>: 16.489717135137877
Darcy is not in the least to
blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that
though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his
invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had
taken himself out of the way.<eos>: 58.43623480841478
His coming into the country at all, is a
most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.
I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt;
but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better."

"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said
Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of Mr.<eos>: 42.28142517566475
Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can
assure you, he informed me himself."

"I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.
"Excuse my interference.--It was kindly meant."

"Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself.--"You are much mistaken if
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.<eos>: 44.60118148768663
I see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.
Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of Bingley.<eos>: 40.83195218958602
Jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the
evening.--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment
solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing
else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for
happiness.

"I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr.<eos>: 44.849371077530165
Wickham.<eos>: 3.5668334354334417
But perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
you may be sure of my pardon."

"No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
satisfactory to tell you.<eos>: 31.538271284325578
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Bingley does not know the whole of his
history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended Mr.<eos>: 38.61845009861908
Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
Mr.<eos>: 31.47270779709283
Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr.<eos>: 47.4745612762746
Darcy than he has
received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his
sister's, Mr.<eos>: 22.86066959946035
Wickham is by no means a respectable young man.<eos>: 35.35183247651246
I am
afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr.<eos>: 33.29345301923723
Darcy's
regard."

"Mr.<eos>: 10.035925501086739
Bingley does not know Mr.<eos>: 9.979359615124427
Wickham himself?"

"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton."

"This account then is what he has received from Mr.<eos>: 49.404553568846204
Darcy.<eos>: 5.0362465464125075
I am
perfectly satisfied.<eos>: 15.870739546734942
But what does he say of the living?"

"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
them from Mr.<eos>: 46.21669371719716
Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only."

"I have not a doubt of Mr.<eos>: 26.33992489908869
Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly;
"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.<eos>: 40.17992286977459
Mr.
Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of
both gentlemen as I did before."

She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment.<eos>: 75.51832638982377
Elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of
Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it.<eos>: 40.45620414481609
On their being joined by Mr.<eos>: 17.839818981063235
Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr.<eos>: 41.852057801877436
Collins came up to them and
told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to
make a most important discovery.

"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness.<eos>: 40.76136895044457
I happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother
Lady Catherine.<eos>: 51.87052077752333
How wonderfully these sort of things occur!<eos>: 46.28094680211035
Who would
have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de
Bourgh in this assembly!--I am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,
and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.<eos>: 69.7273362482738
My total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."

"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr.<eos>: 32.73474769247609
Darcy?"

"Indeed I am.<eos>: 21.85554283959307
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_.<eos>: 32.18730982303727
It will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night."

Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him
that Mr.<eos>: 53.56065793931104
Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as
an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it
was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr.<eos>: 54.40766198871085
Darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance.--Mr.<eos>: 50.84129746615859
Collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she
ceased speaking, replied thus,

"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those
which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
same time maintained.<eos>: 64.65800778356225
You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates
of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look
on as a point of duty.<eos>: 50.615675289910186
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your
advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though
in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and
habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like
yourself." And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.<eos>: 79.95514627700804
Darcy, whose
reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
being so addressed was very evident.<eos>: 78.24285418124379
Her cousin prefaced his speech with
a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if
hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology,"
"Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh."--It vexed her to see him
expose himself to such a man.<eos>: 60.61310061438999
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained
wonder, and when at last Mr.<eos>: 45.2410927727902
Collins allowed him time to speak, replied
with an air of distant civility.<eos>: 53.47517668868259
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Collins, however, was not
discouraged from speaking again, and Mr.<eos>: 16.913714627794384
Darcy's contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.<eos>: 55.92104706319734
Mr.
Collins then returned to Elizabeth.

"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my
reception.<eos>: 13.694340357143128
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.<eos>: 28.678294876774945
He answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,
that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.<eos>: 41.485073616320484
It was really a very
handsome thought.<eos>: 49.989272768055734
Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."

As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr.<eos>: 46.95758326774026
Bingley, and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane.<eos>: 66.4927382811788
She saw her in idea settled in
that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of
endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters.<eos>: 134.05715486217494
Her mother's thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
venture near her, lest she might hear too much.<eos>: 52.39549045474678
When they sat down to
supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find
that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,
openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be
soon married to Mr.<eos>: 81.17282051086289
Bingley.--It was an animating subject, and Mrs.
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of
the match.<eos>: 29.108814464847086
His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living
but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do.<eos>: 49.51114199859508
It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.<eos>: 48.513045111793005
It was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on
such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.<eos>: 71.12195405206968
She
concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it.

In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by Mr.<eos>: 45.46130577648249
Darcy, who sat opposite to them.<eos>: 43.76416690831419
Her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.

"What is Mr.<eos>: 21.82333422132931
Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?<eos>: 26.34543897338319
I am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing _he_ may not like to hear."

"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.--What advantage can it be to you
to offend Mr.<eos>: 70.11005772003728
Darcy?--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing."

Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.<eos>: 62.44859117669685
Her mother
would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.<eos>: 28.721749949486696
Elizabeth blushed
and blushed again with shame and vexation.<eos>: 73.26467483023362
She could not help frequently
glancing her eye at Mr.<eos>: 25.864486181150514
Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.<eos>: 41.95386283677108
The expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity.

At length however Mrs.<eos>: 70.65650102546682
Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.
Elizabeth now began to revive.<eos>: 24.47856424263484
But not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company.<eos>: 65.09178622641724
By many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she
watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience
which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving
amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be
prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute
began another.<eos>: 68.66263715471041
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display;
her voice was weak, and her manner affected.--Elizabeth was in agonies.
She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly
talking to Bingley.<eos>: 57.43377538440257
She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however
impenetrably grave.<eos>: 45.74550697642627
She looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest Mary should be singing all night.<eos>: 43.20058264114719
He took the hint,
and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,

"That will do extremely well, child.<eos>: 61.06282555267592
You have delighted us long enough.
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."

Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to.

"If I," said Mr.<eos>: 60.308684773093226
Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an
air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--I do not mean however to
assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to
music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.<eos>: 50.00499976421135
The
rector of a parish has much to do.--In the first place, he must make
such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron.<eos>: 48.08887665993724
He must write his own sermons; and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible.<eos>: 49.11828337659427
And I do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every
body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.<eos>: 70.56248433542127
I cannot
acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should
omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected
with the family." And with a bow to Mr.<eos>: 53.10920842542214
Darcy, he concluded his speech,
which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--Many
stared.--Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.<eos>: 70.71850191200043
Bennet
himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr.<eos>: 31.98327549525905
Collins for having
spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that
he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.

To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed.<eos>: 69.72116529955564
That his two sisters and Mr.<eos>: 14.104406493429414
Darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and
she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.

The rest of the evening brought her little amusement.<eos>: 42.43301869600749
She was teazed by
Mr.<eos>: 7.544858923574656
Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he
could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her
power to dance with others.<eos>: 27.74200032356458
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.
He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening.<eos>: 68.8745864581067
There was no arguing upon such a project.<eos>: 38.31884203351347
She owed
her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and
good-naturedly engaged Mr.<eos>: 50.96507942837545
Collins's conversation to herself.

She was at least free from the offence of Mr.<eos>: 25.882357187743988
Darcy's farther notice;
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.<eos>: 72.1854429874966
She felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to Mr.<eos>: 21.30320443860142
Wickham, and rejoiced in
it.

The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a
manoeuvre of Mrs.<eos>: 24.677039438774877
Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of
an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family.<eos>: 66.94161814405423
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.<eos>: 47.3342384588468
They repulsed
every attempt of Mrs.<eos>: 20.42604809228086
Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of Mr.<eos>: 33.78805859730034
Collins, who was complimenting Mr.<eos>: 11.061119194081375
Bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.<eos>: 44.02045716425642
Darcy said
nothing at all.<eos>: 28.135840859646947
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
Mr.<eos>: 24.26547539065853
Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other.<eos>: 36.28098083689964
Elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either Mrs.<eos>: 63.132383549626304
Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord,
how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn.

When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs.<eos>: 43.76533499876338
Bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and
addressed herself particularly to Mr.<eos>: 47.553830126709464
Bingley, to assure him how happy
he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,
without the ceremony of a formal invitation.<eos>: 48.33205335927762
Bingley was all grateful
pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of
waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to
go the next day for a short time.

Mrs.<eos>: 48.007009339622684
Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four
months.<eos>: 83.3141431945668
Of having another daughter married to Mr.<eos>: 29.333224434042023
Collins, she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
was eclipsed by Mr.<eos>: 63.25491826435963
Bingley and Netherfield.




CHAPTER XIX.


The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.<eos>: 39.57749797299884
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Collins made his
declaration in form.<eos>: 47.95267473327538
Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.<eos>: 63.69576968935461
On finding
Mrs.<eos>: 17.353471485907416
Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon
after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,

"May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,
when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning?"

Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs.
Bennet instantly answered,

"Oh dear!--Yes--certainly.--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am
sure she can have no objection.--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs." And
gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth
called out,

"Dear Ma'am, do not go.--I beg you will not go.--Mr.<eos>: 51.36500544273747
Collins must excuse
me.--He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear.<eos>: 34.00385680453585
I am
going away myself."

"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.--I desire you will stay where you are."--And
upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
to escape, she added, "Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
Mr.<eos>: 57.58362527654091
Collins."

Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried
to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided
between distress and diversion.<eos>: 56.38744851407067
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as
soon as they were gone Mr.<eos>: 23.21317425231644
Collins began.

"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.<eos>: 39.03075891307149
You
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected
mother's permission for this address.<eos>: 54.02174976817798
You can hardly doubt the purport
of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.<eos>: 78.61804539861821
Almost as
soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my
future life.<eos>: 58.31607728974557
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of
selecting a wife, as I certainly did."

The idea of Mr.<eos>: 59.294333042439
Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not
use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and
he continued:

"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example
of matrimony in his parish.<eos>: 97.83266522755613
Secondly, that I am convinced it will add
very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have
mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation
of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this
subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left
Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs.<eos>: 66.29926183373193
Jenkinson was
arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr.<eos>: 18.92246207829963
Collins, you
must marry.<eos>: 16.987835491894263
A clergyman like you must marry.--Chuse properly, chuse a
gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way.<eos>: 120.20837111297234
This is my advice.<eos>: 34.21299588644935
Find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and
kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer.<eos>: 55.50302201367376
You will find her manners beyond any
thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect
which her rank will inevitably excite.<eos>: 80.93771604887216
Thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
assure you there are many amiable young women.<eos>: 92.91701967184832
But the fact is, that
being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy
myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be
for several years.<eos>: 77.85136970320103
This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I
flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.<eos>: 39.892238996505625
And now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection.<eos>: 41.55213328116464
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the 4 per cents.<eos>: 50.24527166295753
which will not be yours till after your mother's
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.<eos>: 34.940484703185064
On that head,
therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."

It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.

"You are too hasty, Sir," she cried.<eos>: 54.43155408395191
"You forget that I have made no
answer.<eos>: 21.205117998859002
Let me do it without farther loss of time.<eos>: 49.42163930342593
Accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me.<eos>: 63.9289622027553
I am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline
them."

"I am not now to learn," replied Mr.<eos>: 24.51372620813151
Collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a
third time.<eos>: 77.04906962662642
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."

"Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration.<eos>: 43.00053858635128
I do assure you that I am not
one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time.<eos>: 72.03744439209754
I am perfectly serious in my refusal.--You could not make _me_
happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who
would make _you_ so.--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation."

"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr.<eos>: 48.7989960529057
Collins
very gravely--"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you.<eos>: 35.55708331702282
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of
seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,
economy, and other amiable qualifications."

"Indeed, Mr.<eos>: 35.707347189303455
Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.<eos>: 32.72064284221618
You must
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of
believing what I say.<eos>: 53.46602175523654
I wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.<eos>: 68.9497686530741
This matter may be
considered, therefore, as finally settled." And rising as she thus
spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr.<eos>: 57.78839357419459
Collins thus
addressed her,

"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the
first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character."

"Really, Mr.<eos>: 54.73320399310191
Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me
exceedingly.<eos>: 22.718293999432397
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
may convince you of its being one."

"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.<eos>: 60.065009117576736
My reasons for
believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand
is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would
be any other than highly desirable.<eos>: 84.86240558040765
My situation in life, my connections
with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther
consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.<eos>: 80.03142075482316
Your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the
effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.<eos>: 35.69074463935086
As I must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I
shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."

"I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.<eos>: 47.99877963498013
I would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.<eos>: 76.05690323256913
I thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossible.<eos>: 68.15216233981211
My feelings in every respect
forbid it.<eos>: 43.35934925402811
Can I speak plainer?<eos>: 31.781986179317904
Do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the
truth from her heart."

"You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable."

To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.




CHAPTER XX.


Mr.<eos>: 59.766982998345256
Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love; for Mrs.<eos>: 37.84476677882638
Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the
door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.<eos>: 76.67474668198743
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.

This information, however, startled Mrs.<eos>: 48.86562941853213
Bennet;--she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe
it, and could not help saying so.

"But depend upon it, Mr.<eos>: 30.63205863913105
Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall be
brought to reason.<eos>: 25.090933228442704
I will speak to her about it myself directly.<eos>: 44.991830457534306
She is
a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but
I will _make_ her know it."

"Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam," cried Mr.<eos>: 30.58627889429112
Collins; "but if she
is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.<eos>: 56.38496530400017
If therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to
force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."

"Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs.<eos>: 62.173301026996576
Bennet, alarmed.<eos>: 21.584180021848333
"Lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these.<eos>: 27.814601762866342
In every thing else she is as
good natured a girl as ever lived.<eos>: 101.07805760568726
I will go directly to Mr.<eos>: 14.402311826478698
Bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure."

She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library,

"Oh!<eos>: 37.60614482735268
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr.<eos>: 83.69716829808566
Collins, for she vows she will
not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and
not have _her_."

Mr.<eos>: 55.90932261866192
Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
her communication.

"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had
finished her speech.<eos>: 41.602599676565816
"Of what are you talking?"

"Of Mr.<eos>: 37.11441455246995
Collins and Lizzy.<eos>: 16.17030933505638
Lizzy declares she will not have Mr.<eos>: 16.855245106849434
Collins,
and Mr.<eos>: 5.480946975587337
Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy."

"And what am I to do on the occasion?--It seems an hopeless business."

"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.<eos>: 70.93234855816151
Tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him."

"Let her be called down.<eos>: 40.74527179473185
She shall hear my opinion."

Mrs.<eos>: 26.643321530218312
Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the
library.

"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared.<eos>: 29.330458046311005
"I have sent for
you on an affair of importance.<eos>: 40.43058588326709
I understand that Mr.<eos>: 10.313673952108985
Collins has made
you an offer of marriage.<eos>: 31.362816161405654
Is it true?" Elizabeth replied that it was.
"Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?"

"I have, Sir."

"Very well.<eos>: 43.533778410810825
We now come to the point.<eos>: 22.29851562336829
Your mother insists upon your
accepting it.<eos>: 57.32034466347766
Is not it so, Mrs.<eos>: 29.31691225597075
Bennet?"

"Yes, or I will never see her again."

"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.<eos>: 32.25185696336036
From this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents.--Your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry Mr.<eos>: 54.13317345555649
Collins, and I will never see you again
if you _do_."

Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;
but Mrs.<eos>: 39.25025879519387
Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.

"What do you mean, Mr.<eos>: 33.643987008537465
Bennet, by talking in this way?<eos>: 38.15045027285901
You promised me
to _insist_ upon her marrying him."

"My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to request.
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and secondly, of my room.<eos>: 37.34876155333168
I shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be."

Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
Mrs.<eos>: 32.97009269826073
Bennet give up the point.<eos>: 32.96277079008246
She talked to Elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns.<eos>: 38.10097072976685
She endeavoured to secure Jane in
her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined
interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks.<eos>: 79.46611304293718
Though her manner
varied however, her determination never did.

Mr.<eos>: 48.372141698764906
Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way.<eos>: 60.40163101857604
His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.

While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend
the day with them.<eos>: 57.842588011082356
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr.<eos>: 48.25291669437361
Collins has
made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him."

Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,
who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast-room, where Mrs.<eos>: 51.65448301620609
Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating
her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
family.<eos>: 50.13644638106015
"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone,
"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves."

Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.

"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs.<eos>: 41.99442949290484
Bennet, "looking as unconcerned
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided
she can have her own way.--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead.--_I_ shall not be able to keep
you--and so I warn you.--I have done with you from this very day.--I
told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you
again, and you will find me as good as my word.<eos>: 41.27011126558131
I have no pleasure in
talking to undutiful children.--Not that I have much pleasure indeed in
talking to any body.<eos>: 48.44297947800596
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints
can have no great inclination for talking.<eos>: 74.4262482066812
Nobody can tell what I
suffer!--But it is always so.<eos>: 43.16036593257685
Those who do not complain are never
pitied."

Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any
attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.
She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
they were joined by Mr.<eos>: 73.64390699994371
Collins, who entered with an air more stately
than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,

"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and
let Mr.<eos>: 35.64007640778108
Collins and me have a little conversation together."

Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but
Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,
detained first by the civility of Mr.<eos>: 63.05188953921696
Collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear.<eos>: 74.20524795542383
In a doleful voice Mrs.<eos>: 18.28626949247565
Bennet thus began the projected
conversation.--"Oh!<eos>: 56.65002146668805
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Collins!"--

"My dear Madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point.
Far be it from me," he presently continued in a voice that marked his
displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter.<eos>: 52.982431718251306
Resignation to
inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man
who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I
trust I am resigned.<eos>: 55.49577961838407
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.
You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your
family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr.<eos>: 68.52648803177094
Bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission
from your daughter's lips instead of your own.<eos>: 78.21345228137898
But we are all liable to
error.<eos>: 23.31173128949875
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.<eos>: 53.8552156829631
My object
has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_
has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."




CHAPTER XXI.


The discussion of Mr.<eos>: 58.26220223869645
Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and
Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.
As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not
by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
stiffness of manner and resentful silence.<eos>: 73.87911527825018
He scarcely ever spoke to
her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend.

The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs.<eos>: 31.890678829897016
Bennet's ill humour or ill
health.<eos>: 46.76800869216959
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Collins was also in the same state of angry pride.<eos>: 52.8185828068149
Elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it.<eos>: 43.863322442814614
He was always to have gone on
Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.

After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr.<eos>: 59.35527554698795
Wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their
aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was
well talked over.--To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed.

"I found," said he, "as the time drew near, that I had better not meet
Mr.<eos>: 58.117725801483964
Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself."

She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with
them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her.
His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.

Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came
from Netherfield, and was opened immediately.<eos>: 61.446623689581486
The envelope contained a
sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's
fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as
she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.
Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to
join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but
Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,
than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs.<eos>: 76.65166202111152
When they
had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,

"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a
good deal.<eos>: 65.73953164208103
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are
on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.
You shall hear what she says."

She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr.
Hurst had a house.<eos>: 70.16953356316392
The next was in these words.<eos>: 50.95939509235522
"I do not pretend to
regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my
dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many
returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean
while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most
unreserved correspondence.<eos>: 65.85491000467327
I depend on you for that." To these high
flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she
saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their
absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr.<eos>: 47.062992752907036
Bingley's being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon
cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.

"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country.<eos>: 28.08740185565186
But may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks
forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters?--Mr.<eos>: 102.83796973219972
Bingley will not be detained in London by
them."

"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
Hertfordshire this winter.<eos>: 47.80049050735767
I will read it to you--

"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.<eos>: 58.940538416910435
Many of my acquaintance are
already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest
friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I
despair.<eos>: 45.89220160554118
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in
the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux
will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of
whom we shall deprive you."

"It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this
winter."

"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_."

"Why will you think so?<eos>: 39.54225532424341
It must be his own doing.--He is his own master.
But you do not know _all_.<eos>: 33.95906536651471
I _will_ read you the passage which
particularly hurts me.<eos>: 43.78180656292967
I will have no reserves from _you_." "Mr.<eos>: 12.48883977616465
Darcy
is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are
scarcely less eager to meet her again.<eos>: 48.95840545418261
I really do not think Georgiana
Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the
affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of
her being hereafter our sister.<eos>: 138.51623584688537
I do not know whether I ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the
country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable.<eos>: 42.37104977213741
My brother admires her greatly already, he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her
relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's
partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most
capable of engaging any woman's heart.<eos>: 105.46851572379981
With all these circumstances to
favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest
Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many?"

"What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?"--said Jane as she
finished it.<eos>: 92.740568943254
"Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare
that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she
is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she
suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to
put me on my guard?<eos>: 81.39413052212775
Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"

"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--Will you hear it?"

"Most willingly."

"You shall have it in few words.<eos>: 55.95118217362475
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.<eos>: 32.76304132285253
She follows him to
town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you."

Jane shook her head.

"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.--No one who has ever seen you
together, can doubt his affection.<eos>: 47.77749256677653
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot.<eos>: 43.28203646261739
She is
not such a simpleton.<eos>: 14.963415847174996
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.<eos>: 39.03136485182355
Darcy
for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.<eos>: 40.58963663175367
But the case is
this.<eos>: 32.80256958658819
We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the
more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that
when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in
achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I
dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.<eos>: 45.84834910722546
But,
my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of
being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."

"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your
representation of all this, might make me quite easy.<eos>: 54.28411246429186
But I know the
foundation is unjust.<eos>: 25.237153670769132
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any
one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
herself."

"That is right.--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine.<eos>: 50.40201030871234
Believe her to be deceived by all means.
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."

"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere?"

"You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth, "and if upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by
all means to refuse him."

"How can you talk so?"--said Jane faintly smiling,--"You must know that
though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
not hesitate."

"I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider
your situation with much compassion."

"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required.<eos>: 50.65273600627163
A thousand things may arise in six months!"

The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt.<eos>: 114.82979166818734
It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's
interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of every one.

She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on
the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.
Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.

They agreed that Mrs.<eos>: 58.663675759882125
Bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together.<eos>: 53.38740292392597
After
lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking
that Mr.<eos>: 44.13187707834505
Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn,
and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though
he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have
two full courses.




CHAPTER XXII.


The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the
chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr.<eos>: 51.39829342825735
Collins.
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.<eos>: 16.930679170078733
"It keeps him in good
humour," said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express."
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.<eos>: 45.62257350294521
This was
very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth
had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her
from any return of Mr.<eos>: 70.34354991247777
Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards
herself.<eos>: 30.961901261692265
Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so
favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.
But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw
himself at her feet.<eos>: 62.127525994494405
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.<eos>: 57.208870946051555
His
reception however was of the most flattering kind.<eos>: 53.26869943706387
Miss Lucas perceived
him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly
set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.<eos>: 39.736169089665836
But little had she dared
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.

In as short a time as Mr.<eos>: 91.90294562746105
Collins's long speeches would allow, every
thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they
entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was
to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be
waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his
happiness.<eos>: 38.21606881868455
The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and
disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained.

Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.<eos>: 62.74377554254055
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Collins's present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair.<eos>: 59.132211527537606
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
Mr.<eos>: 94.80030195658088
Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided
opinion, that whenever Mr.<eos>: 39.264613357556385
Collins should be in possession of the
Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at St.<eos>: 41.63885858602592
James's.<eos>: 8.753187795361729
The whole family in short
were properly overjoyed on the occasion.<eos>: 60.99206310790579
The younger girls formed hopes
of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's
dying an old maid.<eos>: 61.65764183656346
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed.<eos>: 25.988197002131475
She had
gained her point, and had time to consider of it.<eos>: 32.8067540249283
Her reflections were
in general satisfactory.<eos>: 77.68402895729889
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor
agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be
imaginary.<eos>: 45.51904447793983
But still he would be her husband.--Without thinking highly
either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it
was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small
fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their
pleasantest preservative from want.<eos>: 120.76945617847845
This preservative she had now
obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been
handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.<eos>: 29.479661338172594
The least agreeable
circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to
Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other
person.<eos>: 125.76193759237009
Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though
her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such
disapprobation.<eos>: 33.567702316989845
She resolved to give her the information herself, and
therefore charged Mr.<eos>: 34.904928615555775
Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner,
to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.<eos>: 37.76350785150182
A promise
of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept
without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst
forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some
ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great
self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.

As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night; and Mrs.<eos>: 66.49183045427479
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said
how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his
other engagements might allow him to visit them.

"My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you
may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible."

They were all astonished; and Mr.<eos>: 37.14294267608856
Bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said,

"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my
good sir?--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of
offending your patroness."

"My dear sir," replied Mr.<eos>: 50.30267758351752
Collins, "I am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."

"You cannot be too much on your guard.<eos>: 40.15169628865476
Risk any thing rather than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence."

"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of
your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.<eos>: 65.55435528811368
As for my fair cousins,
though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall
now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting
my cousin Elizabeth."

With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.<eos>: 108.43974975074958
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet wished
to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of
her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a
solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and
improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very
agreeable companion.<eos>: 61.42693670960437
But on the following morning, every hope of this
kind was done away.<eos>: 41.530768353111334
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.

The possibility of Mr.<eos>: 48.67859373432683
Collins's fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but
that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from
possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her
astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the
bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,

"Engaged to Mr.<eos>: 47.429959516155265
Collins!<eos>: 5.563675787512131
my dear Charlotte,--impossible!"

The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon
regained her composure, and calmly replied,

"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible
that Mr.<eos>: 61.10436371337864
Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"

But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect
of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished
her all imaginable happiness.

"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte,--"you must be
surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr.<eos>: 42.6688962652305
Collins was wishing to
marry you.<eos>: 29.18962219201842
But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you
will be satisfied with what I have done.<eos>: 27.587688756103066
I am not romantic you know.<eos>: 15.773123652364202
I
never was.<eos>: 20.314276786548746
I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr.<eos>: 41.396957768644135
Collins's
character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state."

Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family.<eos>: 64.49072687970556
Charlotte did not stay much
longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.<eos>: 45.35317527436469
It
was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match.<eos>: 36.09310172206443
The strangeness of Mr.<eos>: 5.212031401672182
Collins's making two offers
of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being
now accepted.<eos>: 53.260380972653735
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony
was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it
possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every
better feeling to worldly advantage.<eos>: 42.09394062664393
Charlotte the wife of Mr.<eos>: 16.535958156631697
Collins,
was a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing
herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
she had chosen.




CHAPTER XXIII.


Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it,
when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to
announce her engagement to the family.<eos>: 39.36352521380526
With many compliments to them,
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,
but incredulous; for Mrs.<eos>: 43.89984603303285
Bennet, with more perseverance than
politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always
unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,

"Good Lord!<eos>: 47.37670059985661
Sir William, how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know
that Mr.<eos>: 32.02082327760374
Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"

Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy.

Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,
by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she
was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of Mr.<eos>: 52.86275229511907
Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.

Mrs.<eos>: 32.57806545902751
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent.<eos>: 54.74003709680333
In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr.<eos>: 19.00179526861167
Collins
had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy
together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.<eos>: 29.590653135352692
Two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that
Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that
she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.<eos>: 39.22117175175017
Nothing could
console and nothing appease her.--Nor did that day wear out her
resentment.<eos>: 138.64665338735153
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without
scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William
or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter.

Mr.<eos>: 69.67263647310706
Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more foolish than his daughter!

Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.<eos>: 63.482767779754724
Kitty and
Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr.<eos>: 29.848502857825636
Collins was only a
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at Meryton.

Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on
Mrs.<eos>: 49.358684258264034
Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though Mrs.<eos>: 60.21483777058311
Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away.

Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no
real confidence could ever subsist between them again.<eos>: 64.52449234519115
Her
disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.

Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.<eos>: 65.69913362552367
The promised
letter of thanks from Mr.<eos>: 99.49247106425632
Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their
father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted.<eos>: 52.25894748362922
After discharging
his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many
rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither
he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,
he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men.

Mr.<eos>: 51.00432222241215
Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to Mrs.<eos>: 38.741383580820695
Bennet.<eos>: 3.342542937173585
On the contrary she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband.--It was very strange that he should come
to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome.--She hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable.<eos>: 62.772960110653806
Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs.<eos>: 36.65692435436912
Bennet, and they
gave way only to the greater distress of Mr.<eos>: 41.40080782915607
Bingley's continued
absence.

Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.<eos>: 90.06044901956164
Day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to
Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood.

Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.<eos>: 79.14328372857044
Unwilling as she
was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so
dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
frequently recurring.<eos>: 25.467582344811163
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment.

As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more
painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to.<eos>: 44.283469568121724
But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he
did not come back, she should think herself very ill used.<eos>: 62.196333812526845
It needed all
Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.

Mr.<eos>: 47.0148337905653
Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction.<eos>: 58.7194377586251
He was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company.<eos>: 46.56215841464801
The chief of every day was spent by
him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.

Mrs.<eos>: 61.42183419544605
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.<eos>: 22.353529629684047
The very mention of any
thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and
wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.<eos>: 72.67596952338317
The sight of
Miss Lucas was odious to her.<eos>: 16.454507387472006
As her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence.<eos>: 40.96948509189132
Whenever Charlotte came to see
them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr.<eos>: 43.06816966972993
Collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr.<eos>: 28.1405557962529
Bennet were dead.<eos>: 19.767683580658666
She
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.

"Indeed, Mr.<eos>: 19.95477411500248
Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!"

"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.<eos>: 39.18809409504634
Let us hope for
better things.<eos>: 41.322043090998385
Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor."

This was not very consoling to Mrs.<eos>: 35.01957204216983
Bennet, and, therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before,

"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.<eos>: 31.959949797352664
If it was
not for the entail I should not mind it."

"What should not you mind?"

"I should not mind any thing at all."

"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility."

"I never can be thankful, Mr.<eos>: 33.08073645675637
Bennet, for any thing about the entail.
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from
one's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr.
Collins too!--Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?"

"I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr.<eos>: 70.41992329380527
Bennet.

PRIDE & PREJUDICE.




CHAPTER I.


Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.<eos>: 44.46138740803462
The very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left
the country.

Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of
the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort.<eos>: 64.00575911893912
Miss Darcy's praise occupied
the chief of it.<eos>: 18.382566124021402
Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter.<eos>: 53.049801122761195
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an
inmate of Mr.<eos>: 24.241179032348505
Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture.

Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation.<eos>: 66.19029310028566
Her heart was divided between concern
for her sister, and resentment against all the others.<eos>: 42.81863304292043
To Caroline's
assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no
credit.<eos>: 29.78253971651105
That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to
the caprice of their inclinations.<eos>: 40.09625854442789
Had his own happiness, however, been
the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what
ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she
thought he must be sensible himself.<eos>: 48.60756112828053
It was a subject, in short, on
which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.<eos>: 24.84443444574806
She
could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really
died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he
had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his
observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained
the same, her peace equally wounded.

A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs.<eos>: 52.66479976036542
Bennet's leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying,

"Oh!<eos>: 33.236705139673134
that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.<eos>: 78.68560001970545
But I
will not repine.<eos>: 12.008486625018794
It cannot last long.<eos>: 28.20478615161726
He will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before."

Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.

"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no
reason.<eos>: 34.86487471253909
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all.<eos>: 45.60183349486597
I have nothing either to hope or fear,
and nothing to reproach him with.<eos>: 67.84775561860882
Thank God!<eos>: 21.39747561242339
I have not _that_ pain.<eos>: 29.10286428968885
A
little time therefore.--I shall certainly try to get the better."

With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to any one but myself."

"My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good.<eos>: 45.71968254327602
Your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to
you.<eos>: 28.0544637412483
I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve."

Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sister's warm affection.

"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair.<eos>: 48.31208014424943
_You_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body.<eos>: 73.00016980835107
_I_ only
want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.<eos>: 86.86591222633612
Do not be
afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good will.<eos>: 44.32492930199273
You need not.<eos>: 15.968506499445493
There are few people
whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well.<eos>: 69.92317376061138
The more I see
of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit
or sense.<eos>: 78.93631945938172
I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention;
the other is Charlotte's marriage.<eos>: 66.00731419343525
It is unaccountable!<eos>: 15.442865866731603
in every view it
is unaccountable!"

"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.<eos>: 46.33456371844023
They will
ruin your happiness.<eos>: 38.114659744143424
You do not make allowance enough for difference of
situation and temper.<eos>: 58.77806163517101
Consider Mr.<eos>: 3.1863937783205762
Collins's respectability, and
Charlotte's prudent, steady character.<eos>: 27.773938311842194
Remember that she is one of a
large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something
like regard and esteem for our cousin."

"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that
Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her
understanding, than I now do of her heart.<eos>: 55.59257851776553
My dear Jane, Mr.<eos>: 9.573551577048656
Collins is
a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well
as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries
him, cannot have a proper way of thinking.<eos>: 60.650965837448744
You shall not defend her,
though it is Charlotte Lucas.<eos>: 31.86679794208898
You shall not, for the sake of one
individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor
endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and
insensibility of danger, security for happiness."

"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied
Jane, "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
together.<eos>: 48.69495329210595
But enough of this.<eos>: 28.07653893027655
You alluded to something else.<eos>: 31.21493653756456
You
mentioned _two_ instances.<eos>: 15.119405025333942
I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat
you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk.<eos>: 40.78234815549094
We must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured.<eos>: 34.227758455035385
We must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect.<eos>: 32.390243572015564
It is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us.<eos>: 90.26949446823292
Women fancy admiration means more than
it does."

"And men take care that they should."

"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."

"I am far from attributing any part of Mr.<eos>: 59.92185770482359
Bingley's conduct to design,"
said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.<eos>: 44.624618436418864
Thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business."

"And do you impute it to either of those?"

"Yes; to the last.<eos>: 49.5962681186169
But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what
I think of persons you esteem.<eos>: 50.7086453941608
Stop me whilst you can."

"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him."

"Yes, in conjunction with his friend."

"I cannot believe it.<eos>: 34.009194662976824
Why should they try to influence him?<eos>: 50.34535284161453
They can
only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can
secure it."

"Your first position is false.<eos>: 48.279119354326404
They may wish many things besides his
happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride."

"Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy," replied Jane;
"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.<eos>: 85.7019217215096
They have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better.<eos>: 81.35433788287533
But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother's.<eos>: 40.38051729142124
What sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable?<eos>: 48.196647526800405
If they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.<eos>: 36.24494247268111
By supposing such an
affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy.<eos>: 90.49323445747861
Do not distress me by the idea.<eos>: 31.99950694103026
I am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of
what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.<eos>: 39.377714821799266
Let me take it
in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."

Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr.<eos>: 31.458868597746747
Bingley's
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.

Mrs.<eos>: 25.915071833227785
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account
for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it
with less perplexity.<eos>: 70.58151884633217
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what
she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw
her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.<eos>: 34.77091497861783
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet's best
comfort was, that Mr.<eos>: 21.846216904768742
Bingley must be down again in the summer.

Mr.<eos>: 21.572472630714756
Bennet treated the matter differently.<eos>: 49.73473290649263
"So, Lizzy," said he one day,
"your sister is crossed in love I find.<eos>: 41.643211841292036
I congratulate her.<eos>: 14.106275887379576
Next to
being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.
It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among
her companions.<eos>: 81.9471363570642
When is your turn to come?<eos>: 49.10404149060327
You will hardly bear to be
long outdone by Jane.<eos>: 22.330098883107414
Now is your time.<eos>: 25.05118069889248
Here are officers enough at
Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.<eos>: 46.817997932172275
Let Wickham
be _your_ man.<eos>: 109.6008716074312
He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."

"Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.<eos>: 36.743834799012646
We must not
all expect Jane's good fortune."

"True," said Mr.<eos>: 22.68145655897921
Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of
that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always
make the most of it."

Mr.<eos>: 42.302887217792595
Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom,
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn
family.<eos>: 35.838794970110975
They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve.<eos>: 47.852852719884986
The whole of what Elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on Mr.<eos>: 39.404851278979
Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was
pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr.<eos>: 31.499894059336548
Darcy before they
had known any thing of the matter.

Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of
Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
Mr.<eos>: 44.37996992242661
Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.




CHAPTER II.


After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.
Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of
Saturday.<eos>: 52.509038846230716
The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason
to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.<eos>: 36.64380808862083
He took leave
of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished
his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
another letter of thanks.

On the following Monday, Mrs.<eos>: 128.98455175177685
Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at
Longbourn.<eos>: 38.284539059977384
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.<eos>: 96.81609706740532
The Netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well
bred and agreeable.<eos>: 40.33180677111275
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Gardiner, who was several years younger than
Mrs.<eos>: 39.24066679180473
Bennet and Mrs.<eos>: 6.587606034592746
Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.<eos>: 70.34012705971782
Between the
two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular
regard.<eos>: 66.59454741520861
They had frequently been staying with her in town.

The first part of Mrs.<eos>: 24.06713922348367
Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.<eos>: 26.722849023231124
When this was
done, she had a less active part to play.<eos>: 51.01225835503285
It became her turn to listen.
Mrs.<eos>: 30.631720068206093
Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.<eos>: 35.02153442510511
They
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.<eos>: 50.223247044033386
Two of her
girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing
in it.

"I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got Mr.
Bingley, if she could.<eos>: 30.68071640100532
But, Lizzy!<eos>: 15.434544146743225
Oh, sister!<eos>: 26.993516160079437
it is very hard to think
that she might have been Mr.<eos>: 15.064446676094251
Collins's wife by this time, had not it
been for her own perverseness.<eos>: 29.378471272439604
He made her an offer in this very room,
and she refused him.<eos>: 44.895076933209886
The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have
a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as
much entailed as ever.<eos>: 68.81419363872945
The Lucases are very artful people indeed,
sister.<eos>: 70.19820537714496
They are all for what they can get.<eos>: 29.89015817736967
I am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is.<eos>: 27.627984404846003
It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else.<eos>: 41.17433678458436
However, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves."

Mrs.<eos>: 36.11315510204311
Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in
the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her
sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the
conversation.

When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.<eos>: 44.67138099302043
"It
seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," said she.<eos>: 25.493906115428395
"I am
sorry it went off.<eos>: 16.634836251731194
But these things happen so often!<eos>: 98.98070446633542
A young man, such
as you describe Mr.<eos>: 38.906989268344226
Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent."

"An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not
do for _us_.<eos>: 41.02166818544346
We do not suffer by _accident_.<eos>: 15.535989018731557
It does not often happen
that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before."

"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.<eos>: 64.41819668510709
It is as
often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance,
as to a real, strong attachment.<eos>: 110.14014676150155
Pray, how _violent was_ Mr.<eos>: 15.474124010189456
Bingley's
love?"

"I never saw a more promising inclination.<eos>: 21.877149060554096
He was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.<eos>: 32.98624628217992
Every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable.<eos>: 45.25445849574314
At his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and I
spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.<eos>: 116.86864362037949
Could there be
finer symptoms?<eos>: 41.196554897901926
Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"

"Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.<eos>: 46.85942600207424
Poor
Jane!<eos>: 13.31306669573287
I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately.<eos>: 39.37715587604504
It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.<eos>: 93.25537680305337
But do you think she
would be prevailed on to go back with us?<eos>: 33.089999770025756
Change of scene might be of
service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as
anything."

Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister's ready acquiescence.

"I hope," added Mrs.<eos>: 57.12562937990415
Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her.<eos>: 47.317392973508916
We live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her."

"And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
friend, and Mr.<eos>: 54.15018967555616
Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a
part of London!<eos>: 99.62411393271518
My dear aunt, how could you think of it?<eos>: 23.147996404786646
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy may
perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would
hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr.<eos>: 39.96913772288466
Bingley
never stirs without him."

"So much the better.<eos>: 46.0115921526823
I hope they will not meet at all.<eos>: 20.988058003400283
But does not Jane
correspond with the sister?<eos>: 48.95994486000995
_She_ will not be able to help calling."

"She will drop the acquaintance entirely."

But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this
point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being
withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless.<eos>: 54.194163741334776
It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's
attractions.

Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the
Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she
hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,
she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
seeing him.

The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,
the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
engagement.<eos>: 45.755273378893285
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner.<eos>: 33.9137956771247
When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it, of which officers Mr.<eos>: 60.0731220014674
Wickham was sure to be one; and
on these occasions, Mrs.<eos>: 25.719636978458297
Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's
warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.<eos>: 45.46121507276412
Without supposing
them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she
resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left
Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment.

To Mrs.<eos>: 44.303670242675025
Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers.<eos>: 47.1374891420467
About ten or a dozen years ago,
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part
of Derbyshire, to which he belonged.<eos>: 45.039568398345345
They had, therefore, many
acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since
the death of Darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power
to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had
been in the way of procuring.

Mrs.<eos>: 34.46671394436394
Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr.<eos>: 37.659125617069144
Darcy by
character perfectly well.<eos>: 66.90178716543625
Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse.<eos>: 42.69434666942794
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley, with the
minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her
tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was
delighting both him and herself.<eos>: 55.85537604351331
On being made acquainted with the
present Mr.<eos>: 33.69800384262752
Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of
that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree
with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard
Mr.<eos>: 35.2114576955311
Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured
boy.




CHAPTER III.


Mrs.<eos>: 37.694087432376044
Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:

"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you
are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking
openly.<eos>: 53.724351483996244
Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.<eos>: 36.29446347686235
Do not involve
yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of
fortune would make so very imprudent.<eos>: 44.07098796896042
I have nothing to say against
_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
ought to have, I should think you could not do better.<eos>: 38.263618907561685
But as it is--you
must not let your fancy run away with you.<eos>: 47.382099194422
You have sense, and we all
expect you to use it.<eos>: 47.92718389791945
Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
good conduct, I am sure.<eos>: 53.23968006254338
You must not disappoint your father."

"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."

"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."

"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.<eos>: 28.2476930897181
I will take care of
myself, and of Mr.<eos>: 18.118937026175907
Wickham too.<eos>: 16.205749040868437
He shall not be in love with me, if I
can prevent it."

"Elizabeth, you are not serious now."

"I beg your pardon.<eos>: 26.164418641775885
I will try again.<eos>: 23.291513138742438
At present I am not in love with
Mr.<eos>: 21.673336951510926
Wickham; no, I certainly am not.<eos>: 36.82575280322681
But he is, beyond all comparison,
the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
me--I believe it will be better that he should not.<eos>: 59.00250255194
I see the imprudence
of it.--Oh!<eos>: 19.648350074241087
_that_ abominable Mr.<eos>: 13.27523802697956
Darcy!--My father's opinion of me does
me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it.<eos>: 28.777148116545554
My
father, however, is partial to Mr.<eos>: 15.655766570816658
Wickham.<eos>: 3.5668334354334417
In short, my dear aunt, I
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are
seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into
engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist?<eos>: 72.71510457976869
All that I can promise you, therefore, is not
to be in a hurry.<eos>: 25.592025214392095
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object.<eos>: 34.7505177783096
When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.<eos>: 19.347537220627324
In short,
I will do my best."

"Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very
often.<eos>: 35.167013153213006
At least, you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him."

"As I did the other day," said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_.<eos>: 26.15225299573894
But do not imagine
that he is always here so often.<eos>: 30.47810692232687
It is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week.<eos>: 69.22582026835208
You know my mother's ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends.<eos>: 36.18588677052758
But really, and upon my
honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you
are satisfied."

Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point, without being resented.

Mr.<eos>: 40.8734596952628
Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,
his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.<eos>: 53.39836407126019
Bennet.<eos>: 3.342542937173585
His marriage was
now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think
it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that
she "_wished_ they might be happy." Thursday was to be the wedding day,
and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose
to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and
reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her
out of the room.<eos>: 52.52891965520726
As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,

"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza."

"_That_ you certainly shall."

"And I have another favour to ask.<eos>: 49.73951356386181
Will you come and see me?"

"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."

"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.<eos>: 35.59999651367429
Promise me, therefore, to
come to Hunsford."

Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.

"My father and Maria are to come to me in March," added Charlotte, "and
I hope you will consent to be of the party.<eos>: 31.404063801057166
Indeed, Eliza, you will be
as welcome to me as either of them."

The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from
the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the
subject as usual.<eos>: 52.71188796470705
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible.<eos>: 40.48380742344894
Elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,
and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been, rather than what was.<eos>: 53.33767089851254
Charlotte's first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.<eos>: 55.71305389921887
She
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise.<eos>: 41.0943247919901
The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most
friendly and obliging.<eos>: 35.72139673874643
It was Mr.<eos>: 8.359377005975077
Collins's picture of Hunsford and
Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there, to know the rest.

Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.

Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is.<eos>: 59.94124922354883
Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or
hearing from Caroline.<eos>: 71.64617263436428
She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been
lost.

"My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street."

She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.
"I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to London.<eos>: 42.235101546751196
I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.
I enquired after their brother, of course.<eos>: 73.15063884842547
He was well, but so much
engaged with Mr.<eos>: 23.18417121843864
Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him.<eos>: 26.071233045113328
I found that
Miss Darcy was expected to dinner.<eos>: 29.099409220572888
I wish I could see her.<eos>: 21.752774207094234
My visit was
not long, as Caroline and Mrs.<eos>: 32.55878442967685
Hurst were going out.<eos>: 24.00551920726835
I dare say I shall
soon see them here."

Elizabeth shook her head over this letter.<eos>: 44.80101677172996
It convinced her, that
accident only could discover to Mr.<eos>: 60.83620616632931
Bingley her sister's being in town.

Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.<eos>: 36.72271595963315
She endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
blind to Miss Bingley's inattention.<eos>: 20.21605536406304
After waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no
longer.<eos>: 55.19859480168827
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will
prove what she felt.

     "My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
     her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have
     been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me.<eos>: 41.59942745226038
But, my
     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me
     obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour
     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.<eos>: 78.16342880286322
I do not at
     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but
     if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should
     be deceived again.<eos>: 45.89502069220299
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;
     and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time.<eos>: 88.81731867295578
When
     she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;
     she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said
     not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so
     altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly
     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.<eos>: 62.582543014258405
I pity, though I
     cannot help blaming her.<eos>: 22.396332307165277
She was very wrong in singling me out as
     she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on
     her side.<eos>: 61.961892613539064
But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been
     acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her
     brother is the cause of it.<eos>: 37.369222153370586
I need not explain myself farther; and
     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she
     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so
     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may
     feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable.<eos>: 52.816111711703876
I cannot but wonder,
     however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at
     all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.<eos>: 109.99443467859966
He knows of my
     being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and
     yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to
     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy.<eos>: 48.32469393865028
I cannot
     understand it.<eos>: 13.752375987162928
If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should
     be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of
     duplicity in all this.<eos>: 23.081495304465506
But I will endeavour to banish every painful
     thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,
     and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.<eos>: 54.324567317635086
Let me hear
     from you very soon.<eos>: 36.688789517531646
Miss Bingley said something of his never
     returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not
     with any certainty.<eos>: 62.38999954184541
We had better not mention it.<eos>: 22.503166755740533
I am extremely
     glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at
     Hunsford.<eos>: 41.017117607917015
Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria.<eos>: 27.405961738028548
I am
     sure you will be very comfortable there.

     "Your's, &c."

This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.<eos>: 64.04974228830812
She would not
even wish for any renewal of his attentions.<eos>: 29.978039140736456
His character sunk on every
review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.
Darcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away.

Mrs.<eos>: 40.77272900916179
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had
such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself.<eos>: 104.80269385192709
His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
he was the admirer of some one else.<eos>: 32.097656309218486
Elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted it.<eos>: 47.06681876306193
The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than
in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.

All this was acknowledged to Mrs.<eos>: 71.73949501947642
Gardiner; and after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on:--"I am now convinced, my dear aunt,
that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that
pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,
and wish him all manner of evil.<eos>: 66.65059484265223
But my feelings are not only cordial
towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King.<eos>: 54.05539792752898
I cannot find
out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think
her a very good sort of girl.<eos>: 40.64378190474314
There can be no love in all this.<eos>: 30.39465881947385
My
watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love
with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.<eos>: 36.51904776765174
Kitty and Lydia take
his defection much more to heart than I do.<eos>: 89.01782284275207
They are young in the ways
of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the
plain."




CHAPTER IV.


With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did January and February pass away.<eos>: 75.10771137620893
March was to take
Elizabeth to Hunsford.<eos>: 44.46345260034308
She had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty.<eos>: 72.24086612506915
Absence had increased her desire of seeing
Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr.<eos>: 42.79322531480412
Collins.<eos>: 3.406007001821786
There was
novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake.<eos>: 48.612519711262344
The journey would moreover give her
a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
been very sorry for any delay.<eos>: 48.06410811647214
Every thing, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch.<eos>: 31.22921944463301
She was
to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.<eos>: 34.286423116335044
The improvement of
spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became
perfect as plan could be.

The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.

The farewell between herself and Mr.<eos>: 65.60231286081682
Wickham was perfectly friendly; on
his side even more.<eos>: 64.06645162863735
His present pursuit could not make him forget that
Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what
she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide,
there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her
to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced,
that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the
amiable and pleasing.

Her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think
him less agreeable.<eos>: 71.28831340453624
Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good
humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that
could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight
as the rattle of the chaise.<eos>: 61.41547063018778
Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had
known Sir William's too long.<eos>: 35.19281361480346
He could tell her nothing new of the
wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn
out like his information.

It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon.<eos>: 52.38218149597305
As they drove to Mr.<eos>: 12.98807198427722
Gardiner's
door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever.<eos>: 46.8948422365454
On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her
for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.<eos>: 32.52243576932121
All was joy and
kindness.<eos>: 43.47931575773626
The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.

Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.<eos>: 33.95281280195335
Their first subject was her
sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her
spirits, there were periods of dejection.<eos>: 54.5514299831514
It was reasonable, however, to
hope, that they would not continue long.<eos>: 24.83661235640054
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Gardiner gave her the
particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street, and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance.

Mrs.<eos>: 46.71302756473041
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.

"But, my dear Elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is Miss King?<eos>: 23.85829130299104
I
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."

"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive?<eos>: 43.40794509027651
Where does discretion end,
and avarice begin?<eos>: 172.1551919791866
Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a
girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
mercenary."

"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know
what to think."

"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.<eos>: 38.57162033308849
I know no harm of her."

"But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's
death made her mistress of this fortune."

"No--why should he?<eos>: 52.983296379898604
If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?"

"But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so
soon after this event."

"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe.<eos>: 78.32108576975484
If _she_ does not object to it,
why should _we_?"

"_Her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_.<eos>: 68.96226018611065
It only shews her being
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling."

"Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose.<eos>: 58.61515237629357
_He_ shall be
mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish."

"No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose.<eos>: 31.98096849075276
I should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire."

"Oh!<eos>: 22.94180874350295
if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not
much better.<eos>: 62.58253021204899
I am sick of them all.<eos>: 16.810246520337955
Thank Heaven!<eos>: 14.495698740840888
I am going to-morrow
where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
neither manner nor sense to recommend him.<eos>: 53.84474036060339
Stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing, after all."

"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."

Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.

"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs.
Gardiner, "but perhaps to the Lakes."

No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.<eos>: 68.3947033156858
"My dear, dear
aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight!<eos>: 35.730371803136386
what felicity!<eos>: 26.849212021216317
You give me
fresh life and vigour.<eos>: 51.42424103667204
Adieu to disappointment and spleen.<eos>: 17.652664489327705
What are men
to rocks and mountains?<eos>: 27.29408115054448
Oh!<eos>: 4.7344512948191735
what hours of transport we shall spend!<eos>: 110.84692858883264
And
when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without
being able to give one accurate idea of any thing.<eos>: 42.70954364093843
We _will_ know where
we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.<eos>: 65.30447366048773
Lakes, mountains,
and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when
we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling
about its relative situation.<eos>: 56.30694633199395
Let _our_ first effusions be less
insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."




CHAPTER V.


Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to
Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.

When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in
search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side.<eos>: 45.814537050534156
Elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.

At length the Parsonage was discernible.<eos>: 28.54949802714
The garden sloping to the road,
the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every
thing declared they were arriving.<eos>: 28.514415626009097
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Collins and Charlotte appeared at
the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a
short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole
party.<eos>: 31.01384801207415
In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the
sight of each other.<eos>: 27.71763612776991
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest
pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when
she found herself so affectionately received.<eos>: 43.11974782426231
She saw instantly that her
cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility
was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate
to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family.<eos>: 65.04099495387915
They were then,
with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance,
taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he
welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble
abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.

Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect
and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if
wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.<eos>: 44.49717693826368
But though
every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him
by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend
that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion.<eos>: 46.666874892498804
When Mr.
Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,
which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on
Charlotte.<eos>: 50.30021842768846
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general
Charlotte wisely did not hear.<eos>: 47.69535655802358
After sitting long enough to admire every
article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to
give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London,
Mr.<eos>: 34.64569963434026
Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large
and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and
Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked
of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as
much as possible.<eos>: 46.97584401037123
Here, leading the way through every walk and cross
walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he
asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left
beauty entirely behind.<eos>: 146.84559353146778
He could number the fields in every direction,
and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.<eos>: 57.392061681395106
But
of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom
could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings,
afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly
opposite the front of his house.<eos>: 67.07489661617119
It was a handsome modern building, well
situated on rising ground.

From his garden, Mr.<eos>: 42.34945796997469
Collins would have led them round his two meadows,
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's
help.<eos>: 53.60446051832011
It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every
thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of
which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.<eos>: 45.64332703506161
When Mr.<eos>: 2.820923248578635
Collins could be
forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by
Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten.

She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.<eos>: 44.652017826831106
It
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr.<eos>: 31.97167422581157
Collins joining
in, observed,

"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine
de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will
be delighted with her.<eos>: 35.67669590047375
She is all affability and condescension, and I
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when
service is over.<eos>: 46.88777785831964
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will
include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here.<eos>: 71.57309663178707
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is
charming.<eos>: 88.81247788324922
We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to
walk home.<eos>: 89.2843103914433
Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.<eos>: 37.168906134640956
I
_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."

"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added
Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."

"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.<eos>: 37.75608555236574
She is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."

The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and
telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,
Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon
Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well.<eos>: 65.19928317734299
She had also to anticipate how her visit would
pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of Mr.<eos>: 29.62432487906552
Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
Rosings.<eos>: 18.96214724486588
A lively imagination soon settled it all.

About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up
stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.<eos>: 68.01941857375724
She opened the
door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out,

"Oh, my dear Eliza!<eos>: 33.7681837806735
pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen!<eos>: 38.73625964481943
I will not tell you what it is.<eos>: 18.38374913808735
Make
haste, and come down this moment."

Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,
and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest
of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate.

"And is this all?" cried Elizabeth.<eos>: 60.458144562881394
"I expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her
daughter!"

"La!<eos>: 42.28736553780967
my dear," said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady
Catherine.<eos>: 33.799101827921426
The old lady is Mrs.<eos>: 54.97293528272825
Jenkinson, who lives with them.<eos>: 17.491155952092903
The
other is Miss De Bourgh.<eos>: 28.921531528402248
Only look at her.<eos>: 15.498092226739008
She is quite a little
creature.<eos>: 22.735350568240484
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!"

"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
Why does she not come in?"

"Oh!<eos>: 53.3066460105858
Charlotte says, she hardly ever does.<eos>: 52.235139854322625
It is the greatest of favours
when Miss De Bourgh comes in."

"I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.<eos>: 46.32268019200683
"She
looks sickly and cross.--Yes, she will do for him very well.<eos>: 33.899657221735254
She will
make him a very proper wife."

Mr.<eos>: 27.16217726223346
Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in
conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high
diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the
greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh
looked that way.

At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
the others returned into the house.<eos>: 33.79397838833006
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at Rosings the next day.




CHAPTER VI.


Mr.<eos>: 53.593469013016275
Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete.
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of
doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady
Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.

"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by
her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
Rosings.<eos>: 50.034877401117555
I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
would happen.<eos>: 28.54699649780646
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?<eos>: 37.91893839379181
Who
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
(an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after
your arrival!"

"I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William,
"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.<eos>: 92.8701789535672
About the Court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."

Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but
their visit to Rosings.<eos>: 59.497278034557965
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Collins was carefully instructing them in
what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many
servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.

When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,

"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.<eos>: 38.088697837860934
Lady
Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which
becomes herself and daughter.<eos>: 103.63186849262415
I would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion
for any thing more.<eos>: 48.747850481938116
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for
being simply dressed.<eos>: 73.4927612577625
She likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved."

While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--Such formidable accounts of
her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,
who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her
introduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had
done to his presentation at St.<eos>: 72.50811848716091
James's.

As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile
across the park.--Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as Mr.<eos>: 59.21029719726815
Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh.

When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every
moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly
calm.--Elizabeth's courage did not fail her.<eos>: 51.66992550549774
She had heard nothing of
Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she
thought she could witness without trepidation.

From the entrance hall, of which Mr.<eos>: 54.52514232593247
Collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed
the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine,
her daughter, and Mrs.<eos>: 35.231328429722474
Jenkinson were sitting.--Her Ladyship, with great
condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs.<eos>: 37.75939791383527
Collins had settled it
with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was
performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks
which he would have thought necessary.

In spite of having been at St.<eos>: 44.74032829899631
James's, Sir William was so completely
awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look.<eos>: 43.975451581793166
Elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly.--Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with
strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.<eos>: 75.98930608215012
Her air
was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to
make her visitors forget their inferior rank.<eos>: 80.9299523433904
She was not rendered
formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so
authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr.
Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the
day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had
represented.

When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of Mr.<eos>: 45.49081679595717
Darcy, she turned her eyes on the
daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment, at her
being so thin, and so small.<eos>: 46.07215884646868
There was neither in figure nor face, any
likeness between the ladies.<eos>: 78.35698877787131
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to Mrs.<eos>: 28.674209507920402
Jenkinson, in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes.

After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows,
to admire the view, Mr.<eos>: 44.44869029456835
Collins attending them to point out its
beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much
better worth looking at in the summer.

The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,
and all the articles of plate which Mr.<eos>: 43.09421240962388
Collins had promised; and, as he
had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by
her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater.--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir
William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law
said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and
gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved
a novelty to them.<eos>: 70.42053658788247
The party did not supply much conversation.<eos>: 57.441415489287415
Elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
dinner time.<eos>: 60.903338168892006
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she
were indisposed.<eos>: 66.29225441097672
Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.

When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be
done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have
her judgment controverted.<eos>: 54.66450169356647
She enquired into Charlotte's domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice,
as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be
regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry.<eos>: 35.040524993954534
Elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great Lady's attention, which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others.<eos>: 41.83017563941306
In the intervals of her discourse with
Mrs.<eos>: 14.63215643668871
Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and
Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who she observed to Mrs.<eos>: 50.36926094703156
Collins, was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl.<eos>: 33.13996573032654
She asked her at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
questions, but answered them very composedly.--Lady Catherine then
observed,

"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr.<eos>: 55.223719797865336
Collins, I think.<eos>: 13.80310251964101
For your
sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--It was not thought
necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family.--Do you play and sing, Miss
Bennet?"

"A little."

"Oh!<eos>: 45.54721786022616
then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.<eos>: 57.63508563533155
Our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it
some day.--Do your sisters play and sing?"

"One of them does."

"Why did not you all learn?--You ought all to have learned.<eos>: 108.39980404313596
The Miss
Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as
your's.--Do you draw?"

"No, not at all."

"What, none of you?"

"Not one."

"That is very strange.<eos>: 54.91713605597149
But I suppose you had no opportunity.<eos>: 23.648887907690447
Your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."

"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London."

"Has your governess left you?"

"We never had any governess."

"No governess!<eos>: 51.27866067774995
How was that possible?<eos>: 30.252006361130885
Five daughters brought up at home
without a governess!--I never heard of such a thing.<eos>: 61.19157126655167
Your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education."

Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not
been the case.

"Then, who taught you?<eos>: 36.8506660350412
who attended to you?<eos>: 31.700582869004048
Without a governess you must
have been neglected."

"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn, never wanted the means.<eos>: 67.44871643650477
We were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary.<eos>: 42.046919949628986
Those who chose to be
idle, certainly might."

"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had
known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one.<eos>: 50.081078633587275
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.<eos>: 45.699163522177265
It is
wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that
way.<eos>: 36.44606996243713
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out.<eos>: 42.04825107441279
Four nieces
of Mrs.<eos>: 12.389934466571773
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who
was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
delighted with her.<eos>: 45.55314476212006
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's
calling yesterday to thank me?<eos>: 63.03558329097752
She finds Miss Pope a treasure.<eos>: 13.255993607222194
'Lady
Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your
younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"

"Yes, Ma'am, all."

"All!--What, all five out at once?<eos>: 65.43753053241953
Very odd!--And you only the
second.--The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your
younger sisters must be very young?"

"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.<eos>: 77.88719969583045
Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much
in company.<eos>: 56.536598417260386
But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early.--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of
youth, as the first.<eos>: 76.97391314648564
And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--I think it
would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of
mind."

"Upon my word," said her Ladyship, "you give your opinion very
decidedly for so young a person.--Pray, what is your age?"

"With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth smiling, "your
Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."

Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.

"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not
conceal your age."

"I am not one and twenty."

When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables
were placed.<eos>: 62.97720997258642
Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr.<eos>: 10.468282305143106
and Mrs.<eos>: 3.8891635654619057
Collins sat
down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs.<eos>: 22.62159156157875
Jenkinson to make up her
party.<eos>: 30.653814830892212
Their table was superlatively stupid.<eos>: 14.641791222242313
Scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs.<eos>: 51.47511726910865
Jenkinson
expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or
having too much or too little light.<eos>: 57.828628490822666
A great deal more passed at the
other table.<eos>: 57.779624915471
Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.<eos>: 57.807608957576605
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Collins
was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.
Sir William did not say much.<eos>: 58.64788341635057
He was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names.

When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs.<eos>: 46.31461384355327
Collins,
gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.<eos>: 41.352513571352155
The party then gathered
round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow.<eos>: 106.62340692235011
From these instructions they were summoned by the
arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.
Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed.<eos>: 23.641974028743135
As
soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her
cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,
for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was.<eos>: 36.23131429913859
But
her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means
satisfy Mr.<eos>: 76.49654453144824
Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's
praise into his own hands.




CHAPTER VII.


Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough
to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of
her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met
with.<eos>: 40.54930689969603
While Sir William was with them, Mr.<eos>: 16.867421585329986
Collins devoted his mornings
to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he
went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and
Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin
by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and
dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading
and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which
fronted the road.<eos>: 42.44634948053772
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer
the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for Mr.<eos>: 47.88841178759521
Collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and
she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.

From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
were indebted to Mr.<eos>: 50.162389410018385
Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day.<eos>: 75.09120505198344
She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had
a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed on to get out.

Very few days passed in which Mr.<eos>: 55.72917751884341
Collins did not walk to Rosings, and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours.<eos>: 48.65831528406404
Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits.<eos>: 75.5180766289575
She examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that Mrs.<eos>: 42.84506680688371
Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.

Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the
commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by
Mr.<eos>: 45.969004736851126
Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be
quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
them into harmony and plenty.

The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;
and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card
table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of
the first.<eos>: 57.34332383275321
Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of
the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses' reach.<eos>: 77.76478234940205
This
however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with
Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she
had often great enjoyment out of doors.<eos>: 72.92510240052775
Her favourite walk, and where
she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.

In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an
addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be
important.<eos>: 64.22786777374999
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr.<eos>: 31.10497508685495
Darcy
was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were
not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined
by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
Miss Lucas and herself.

His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr.<eos>: 46.268550883542375
Collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,
in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow
as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great
intelligence.<eos>: 77.63773001244896
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his
respects.<eos>: 48.442251027004886
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for
Mr.<eos>: 16.696090323024144
Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of
his uncle, Lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when
Mr.<eos>: 66.27415797252006
Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him.<eos>: 49.1803152936249
Charlotte had seen
them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running
into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,

"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.<eos>: 53.567333728840865
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me."

Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.<eos>: 53.191164685142795
Colonel Fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly the gentleman.<eos>: 81.1260730228282
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual
reserve, to Mrs.<eos>: 41.29189048001798
Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure.<eos>: 51.15379149626048
Elizabeth merely
curtseyed to him, without saying a word.

Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to Mrs.<eos>: 49.545462936102496
Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.
At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of
Elizabeth after the health of her family.<eos>: 39.78178171731884
She answered him in the usual
way, and after a moment's pause, added,

"My eldest sister has been in town these three months.<eos>: 32.08098650112872
Have you never
happened to see her there?"

She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the
Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.<eos>: 38.42315942584084
The
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away.




CHAPTER VIII.


Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of
their engagements at Rosings.<eos>: 31.162737342173326
It was some days, however, before they
received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the
house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,
almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening.<eos>: 48.47474518163806
For the last week they had seen very little
of either Lady Catherine or her daughter.<eos>: 49.85224867130977
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called
at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr.<eos>: 31.903559905206606
Darcy they had
only seen at church.

The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined
the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room.<eos>: 37.087851695447476
Her ladyship received them
civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,
much more than to any other person in the room.

Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a
welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs.<eos>: 45.46663572979537
Collins's pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much.<eos>: 88.26297036624806
He now seated himself by her, and
talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as
well as of Mr.<eos>: 59.90316715397531
Darcy.<eos>: 5.0362465464125075
_His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a
while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
scruple to call out,

"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?<eos>: 70.0849350148364
What is it you are talking
of?<eos>: 47.9350403287119
What are you telling Miss Bennet?<eos>: 54.91957299388556
Let me hear what it is."

"We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply.

"Of music!<eos>: 36.57694696990108
Then pray speak aloud.<eos>: 45.665304694634116
It is of all subjects my delight.<eos>: 61.555888985173965
I
must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself, or a better natural taste.<eos>: 83.19475792962432
If I had ever learnt, I
should have been a great proficient.<eos>: 14.497490003857072
And so would Anne, if her health
had allowed her to apply.<eos>: 65.32452722177722
I am confident that she would have performed
delightfully.<eos>: 18.879338627856768
How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"

Mr.<eos>: 71.98402804680619
Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.

"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady
Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,
if she does not practise a great deal."

"I assure you, Madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice.
She practises very constantly."

"So much the better.<eos>: 25.927012406231587
It cannot be done too much; and when I next write
to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.<eos>: 50.42143964176595
I often
tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired,
without constant practice.<eos>: 44.68932102041771
I have told Miss Bennet several times, that
she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though
Mrs.<eos>: 42.46395287826481
Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often
told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in
Mrs.<eos>: 35.15810308850279
Jenkinson's room.<eos>: 11.200549227683341
She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that
part of the house."

Mr.<eos>: 30.786657914539024
Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made
no answer.

When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.<eos>: 44.61246127979006
He
drew a chair near her.<eos>: 48.77075529669516
Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then
talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from
her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte,
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's
countenance.<eos>: 54.735472245448754
Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,

"You mean to frighten me, Mr.<eos>: 24.383630579397988
Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me?<eos>: 73.9311231242585
But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at
the will of others.<eos>: 88.74310280702277
My courage always rises with every attempt to
intimidate me."

"I shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could
not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I
have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you
find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact
are not your own."

Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.<eos>: 46.92191263874652
I am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a
part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree
of credit.<eos>: 57.71455326096893
Indeed, Mr.<eos>: 5.532018664879167
Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention
all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me
leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,
and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear."

"I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.

"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried Colonel
Fitzwilliam.<eos>: 43.94016693245633
"I should like to know how he behaves among strangers."

"You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,
was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did?<eos>: 63.56545681436479
He danced
only four dances!<eos>: 71.43366552837698
I am sorry to pain you--but so it was.<eos>: 34.30632520109639
He danced only
four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge,
more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.<eos>: 76.86497133023542
Mr.
Darcy, you cannot deny the fact."

"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party."

"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room.<eos>: 57.84530032772116
Well, Colonel
Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?<eos>: 50.19928200161908
My fingers wait your orders."

"Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an
introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers."

"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth, still
addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.<eos>: 48.844810089011446
"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
himself to strangers?"

"I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying to
him.<eos>: 47.146333607555114
It is because he will not give himself the trouble."

"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy,
"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.<eos>: 52.323152419329894
I cannot
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as I often see done."

"My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which I see so many women's do.<eos>: 52.805214499562986
They have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.<eos>: 36.84064191414916
But then I
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the
trouble of practising.<eos>: 30.89055731616204
It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as
capable as any other woman's of superior execution."

Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right.<eos>: 42.06212260273704
You have employed your
time much better.<eos>: 72.34358244623566
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can
think any thing wanting.<eos>: 51.3914581136898
We neither of us perform to strangers."

Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know
what they were talking of.<eos>: 80.06808071702879
Elizabeth immediately began playing again.
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to Darcy,

"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and
could have the advantage of a London master.<eos>: 42.180432907642924
She has a very good notion
of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's.<eos>: 35.99300173105741
Anne would have
been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."

Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss
De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.

Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste.<eos>: 47.0367605443487
Elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the
gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was
ready to take them all home.




CHAPTER IX.


Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,
while Mrs.<eos>: 30.576021802487297
Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,
when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
visitor.<eos>: 41.372506960405566
As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be
Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her
half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,
when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr.<eos>: 74.55737864703993
Darcy, and Mr.
Darcy only, entered the room.

He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to
be within.

They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.<eos>: 56.55545307980997
It was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence
recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling
curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure, she observed,

"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr.<eos>: 64.32095971686736
Darcy!
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr.<eos>: 20.175211853850737
Bingley to see you
all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day
before.<eos>: 66.7740916013007
He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London."

"Perfectly so--I thank you."

She found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short
pause, added,

"I think I have understood that Mr.<eos>: 36.335736800074564
Bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to Netherfield again?"

"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in future.<eos>: 58.88077414773348
He has many friends, and he is
at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing."

"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there.<eos>: 87.3542505505437
But perhaps Mr.<eos>: 9.761469523437762
Bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same
principle."

"I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it up, as
soon as any eligible purchase offers."

Elizabeth made no answer.<eos>: 35.0119032495826
She was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him.

He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable
house.<eos>: 50.96473318499352
Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.
Collins first came to Hunsford."

"I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object."

"Mr.<eos>: 43.95488102962944
Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife."

"Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
him happy if they had.<eos>: 72.992374859582
My friend has an excellent understanding--though
I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr.<eos>: 44.18207055281877
Collins as the wisest
thing she ever did.<eos>: 102.4698173882551
She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her."

"It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends."

"An easy distance do you call it?<eos>: 49.241960934585194
It is nearly fifty miles."

"And what is fifty miles of good road?<eos>: 54.770235624034754
Little more than half a day's
journey.<eos>: 23.350381164727732
Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance."

"I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match," cried Elizabeth.<eos>: 28.3174681752929
"I should never have said Mrs.<eos>: 17.230782929702645
Collins
was settled _near_ her family."

"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.<eos>: 26.726468760544694
Any thing beyond
the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far."

As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and
Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,

"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family.<eos>: 52.08694891932355
The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances.<eos>: 71.25832436432562
Where there is fortune to make the expence of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.<eos>: 55.525743650340814
But that is not the
case _here_.<eos>: 26.156652910947837
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
and Mrs.<eos>: 3.8891635654619057
Collins have a comfortable income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my
friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
the present distance."

Mr.<eos>: 94.64049965348171
Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_You_ cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment.<eos>: 55.218935970451355
_You_ cannot have
been always at Longbourn."

Elizabeth looked surprised.<eos>: 27.208410763811496
The gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,

"Are you pleased with Kent?"

A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte
and her sister, just returned from their walk.<eos>: 56.70624641868761
The tête-à-tête surprised
them.<eos>: 41.75215075744584
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
much to any body, went away.

"What can be the meaning of this!" said Charlotte, as soon as he was
gone.<eos>: 37.43411465257965
"My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have
called on us in this familiar way."

But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable
from the time of year.<eos>: 51.685134118253146
All field sports were over.<eos>: 29.46312277516951
Within doors there
was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be
always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day.<eos>: 55.509889018666215
They called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
aunt.<eos>: 73.72249100857027
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her
former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw
there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,
she believed he might have the best informed mind.

But why Mr.<eos>: 59.4185055550698
Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult
to understand.<eos>: 33.80732892996702
It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to
propriety, not a pleasure to himself.<eos>: 100.55576805060466
He seldom appeared really
animated.<eos>: 37.319275754942915
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Collins knew not what to make of him.<eos>: 38.06682131015273
Colonel
Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of
love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself
seriously to work to find it out.--She watched him whenever they were at
Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success.<eos>: 54.949065871925264
He
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
look was disputable.<eos>: 37.97725303742686
It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind.

She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.

In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
Colonel Fitzwilliam.<eos>: 62.44001954831359
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
to counterbalance these advantages, Mr.<eos>: 49.55448515355784
Darcy had considerable patronage
in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.




CHAPTER X.


More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly
meet Mr.<eos>: 45.69066224439694
Darcy.--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that
should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever
happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a
favourite haunt of hers.--How it could occur a second time therefore was
very odd!--Yet it did, and even a third.<eos>: 76.69932111916849
It seemed like wilful
ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not
merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he
actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.<eos>: 86.57011779694702
He never
said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of
listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre
that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in
being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr.
and Mrs.<eos>: 61.48594964474677
Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her
not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever
she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too.<eos>: 78.50694362209875
His words
seemed to imply it.<eos>: 18.709567756656078
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?
She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what
might arise in that quarter.<eos>: 88.77711046803
It distressed her a little, and she was
quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the
Parsonage.

She was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's last
letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not
written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr.<eos>: 46.65485475879327
Darcy,
she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.<eos>: 61.08717568960521
Putting
away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,

"I did not know before that you ever walked this way."

"I have been making the tour of the Park," he replied, "as I generally
do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage.<eos>: 44.65563389315109
Are
you going much farther?"

"No, I should have turned in a moment."

And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage
together.

"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she.

"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again.<eos>: 58.95010688765787
But I am at his disposal.<eos>: 15.812817820898404
He
arranges the business just as he pleases."

"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
great pleasure in the power of choice.<eos>: 51.67364449349207
I do not know any body who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr.<eos>: 42.302299470356445
Darcy."

"He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.
"But so we all do.<eos>: 35.413025224340466
It is only that he has better means of having it than
many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.<eos>: 114.5660395270957
I speak
feelingly.<eos>: 13.703506495441813
A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
dependence."

"In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of
either.<eos>: 45.33518778948543
Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
dependence?<eos>: 58.291205290086005
When have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?"

"These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have
experienced many hardships of that nature.<eos>: 71.49228674367478
But in matters of greater
weight, I may suffer from the want of money.<eos>: 62.918928563234516
Younger sons cannot marry
where they like."

"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often
do."

"Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in
my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money."

"Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is
the usual price of an Earl's younger son?<eos>: 69.11380726938566
Unless the elder brother is
very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."

He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.<eos>: 32.464694328480924
To interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
she soon afterwards said,

"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having somebody at his disposal.<eos>: 65.05085194129309
I wonder he does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind.<eos>: 31.011783214856905
But, perhaps his sister does as well
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her."

"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must
divide with me.<eos>: 36.28131233152951
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy."

"Are you, indeed?<eos>: 20.561614846454887
And pray what sort of guardians do you make?<eos>: 78.346506406519
Does your
charge give you much trouble?<eos>: 87.93117856528218
Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a
little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she
may like to have her own way."

As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth.<eos>: 83.45637013954898
She directly replied,

"You need not be frightened.<eos>: 21.202353212350165
I never heard any harm of her; and I dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.<eos>: 14.43860427304513
She is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs.<eos>: 37.8996358326711
Hurst and
Miss Bingley.<eos>: 10.540096941507002
I think I have heard you say that you know them."

"I know them a little.<eos>: 29.61821876627276
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like
man--he is a great friend of Darcy's."

"Oh!<eos>: 36.77294904470871
yes," said Elizabeth drily--"Mr.<eos>: 12.25600201721098
Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.
Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."

"Care of him!--Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in
those points where he most wants care.<eos>: 72.56273864396805
From something that he told me in
our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to
him.<eos>: 46.58381028958352
But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that
Bingley was the person meant.<eos>: 53.081356533147506
It was all conjecture."

"What is it you mean?"

"It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be
generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family,
it would be an unpleasant thing."

"You may depend upon my not mentioning it."

"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be
Bingley.<eos>: 42.47974876616644
What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."

"Did Mr.<eos>: 68.38844541297703
Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"

"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady."

"And what arts did he use to separate them?"

"He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam smiling.<eos>: 61.91531694126086
"He
only told me, what I have now told you."

Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation.<eos>: 33.621627594359076
After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful.

"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she.<eos>: 38.72104210843559
"Your
cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings.<eos>: 30.742134228283565
Why was he to be the judge?"

"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"

"I do not see what right Mr.<eos>: 38.04212401945025
Darcy had to decide on the propriety of
his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy." "But,"
she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.<eos>: 41.750881126995026
It is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case."

"That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is
lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."

This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of
Mr.<eos>: 28.377711375426937
Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent
matters till they reached the parsonage.<eos>: 47.04373592085095
There, shut into her own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard.<eos>: 42.08662301380496
It was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.<eos>: 56.278198825062645
There
could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr.<eos>: 39.00001549775473
Darcy could have
such boundless influence.<eos>: 31.72747337813516
That he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate Mr.<eos>: 24.742203589986357
Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she
had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and
arrangement of them.<eos>: 40.45797105765303
If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,
_he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that
Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.<eos>: 45.53006785867399
He had ruined for a
while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart
in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have
inflicted.

"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel
Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
business in London.

"To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of
objection.<eos>: 80.99992201135738
All loveliness and goodness as she is!<eos>: 37.58019322058388
Her understanding
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.<eos>: 72.20540653276504
Neither could
any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities which Mr.<eos>: 77.84911469521653
Darcy himself need not disdain,
and respectability which he will probably never reach." When she thought
of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would
not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.
Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from
the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want
of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly
governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of
retaining Mr.<eos>: 49.29896440833913
Bingley for his sister.

The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to
her unwillingness to see Mr.<eos>: 51.968511576336944
Darcy, it determined her not to attend her
cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.<eos>: 60.10594409288289
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Collins,
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr.<eos>: 32.323647037984145
Collins
could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather
displeased by her staying at home.




CHAPTER XI.


When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as
much as possible against Mr.<eos>: 26.503492766009117
Darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her
being in Kent.<eos>: 47.83913044237713
They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly
disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded.<eos>: 61.54223544048741
Elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.<eos>: 44.09256272048566
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy's
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a
keener sense of her sister's sufferings.<eos>: 19.696401260028516
It was some consolation to
think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,
and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be
with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her
spirits, by all that affection could do.

She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent, without remembering that
his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not
mean to be unhappy about him.

While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her.<eos>: 50.22211230728057
But
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr.<eos>: 47.340801335630125
Darcy walk into the
room.<eos>: 17.073717382218685
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.
She answered him with cold civility.<eos>: 88.33824350571754
He sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up walked about the room.<eos>: 53.1654191605482
Elizabeth was surprised, but said
not a word.<eos>: 30.783045457202164
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an
agitated manner, and thus began,

"In vain have I struggled.<eos>: 58.39559964322965
It will not do.<eos>: 15.021252328637052
My feelings will not be
repressed.<eos>: 14.826009826531989
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love
you."

Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.<eos>: 40.79962503545915
She stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent.<eos>: 45.70605647330621
This he considered sufficient encouragement,
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her,
immediately followed.<eos>: 54.629742053358555
He spoke well, but there were feelings besides
those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the
subject of tenderness than of pride.<eos>: 47.29184201634265
His sense of her inferiority--of
its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had
always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed
due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to
recommend his suit.

In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost
all compassion in anger.<eos>: 54.93802633911743
She tried, however, to compose herself to
answer him with patience, when he should have done.<eos>: 30.910413237693984
He concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of
all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand.<eos>: 37.08026227241056
As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of
a favourable answer.<eos>: 31.928318624560642
He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his
countenance expressed real security.<eos>: 79.16504545711686
Such a circumstance could only
exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her
cheeks, and she said,

"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned.<eos>: 50.99011257740737
It is natural that obligation should be
felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you.<eos>: 52.58178644264073
But I
cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly.<eos>: 51.891754460663286
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any
one.<eos>: 21.601062469747237
It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of
short duration.<eos>: 29.656835330155157
The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the
acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming
it after this explanation."

Mr.<eos>: 58.64459746836558
Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed
on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise.<eos>: 52.21762405016184
His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of
his mind was visible in every feature.<eos>: 28.944599042151605
He was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed
himself to have attained it.<eos>: 30.509265302231626
The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings
dreadful.<eos>: 37.60674555439291
At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,

"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!<eos>: 35.60144799140011
I
might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
civility, I am thus rejected.<eos>: 52.411469931394514
But it is of small importance."

"I might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of
offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?
Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil?<eos>: 67.38448900703492
But I have
other provocations.<eos>: 19.363149583070932
You know I have.<eos>: 18.77693001090947
Had not my own feelings decided
against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been
favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept
the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
happiness of a most beloved sister?"

As she pronounced these words, Mr.<eos>: 69.69912766185632
Darcy changed colour; but the emotion
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued.

"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.<eos>: 45.21849193193367
No motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_.<eos>: 94.4445931367309
You dare not,
you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind."

She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.

"Can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated.

With assumed tranquillity he then replied, "I have no wish of denying
that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that I rejoice in my success.<eos>: 55.05003330537477
Towards _him_ I have been
kinder than towards myself."

Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.

"But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike
is founded.<eos>: 44.71975231479172
Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was
decided.<eos>: 44.31286425564066
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received
many months ago from Mr.<eos>: 33.64652412916304
Wickham.<eos>: 3.5668334354334417
On this subject, what can you have to
say?<eos>: 21.304397547840036
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?
or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?"

"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said Darcy in
a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.

"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
interest in him?"

"His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes
have been great indeed."

"And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy.<eos>: 82.58643785907093
"You have reduced
him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty.<eos>: 19.549413244707146
You have
withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for
him.<eos>: 24.229866282188375
You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert.<eos>: 52.939246322171876
You have done all this!<eos>: 30.203479867579794
and
yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and
ridicule."

"And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
"is your opinion of me!<eos>: 51.40206134190928
This is the estimation in which you hold me!<eos>: 92.71263618904217
I
thank you for explaining it so fully.<eos>: 35.25858835212396
My faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy indeed!<eos>: 27.669456533939734
But perhaps," added he, stopping in his
walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.<eos>: 49.59124104930952
These
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater policy
concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being
impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
reflection, by every thing.<eos>: 61.93948622744344
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.<eos>: 142.67469296348918
They were natural and just.
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life
is so decidedly beneath my own?"

Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said,

"You are mistaken, Mr.<eos>: 63.5418496983511
Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the
concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner."

She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,

"You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way
that would have tempted me to accept it."

Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.<eos>: 50.34073599585516
She went on.

"From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my
acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the
feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of
disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a
dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the
last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."

"You have said quite enough, madam.<eos>: 55.80115759145622
I perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness."

And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house.

The tumult of her mind was now painfully great.<eos>: 70.2729625821181
She knew not how to
support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an
hour.<eos>: 88.36596115485239
Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was
increased by every review of it.<eos>: 28.95231634585178
That she should receive an offer of
marriage from Mr.<eos>: 23.71877098258208
Darcy!<eos>: 7.10072669940854
that he should have been in love with her for
so many months!<eos>: 25.53247322839032
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all
the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her
sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case,
was almost incredible!<eos>: 58.248745624034264
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously
so strong an affection.<eos>: 42.727588497543714
But his pride, his abominable pride, his
shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his
unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it,
and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.<eos>: 32.30054146882506
Wickham, his
cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the
pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.

She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady
Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.




CHAPTER XII.


Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes.<eos>: 43.117625293794575
She could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing
else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after
breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise.<eos>: 56.84314824880193
She was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr.<eos>: 36.15362040307708
Darcy's
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.
The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed
one of the gates into the ground.

After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
look into the park.<eos>: 45.360943529486406
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees.<eos>: 40.037904933548205
She was on the point of continuing her walk,
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr.
Darcy, she was directly retreating.<eos>: 35.983495028705605
But the person who advanced, was now
near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced
her name.<eos>: 49.464067183150895
She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in
a voice which proved it to be Mr.<eos>: 37.20939056726239
Darcy, she moved again towards the
gate.<eos>: 38.72033882913564
He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter,
which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "I
have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"--And then, with a
slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of
sight.

With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written
quite through, in a very close hand.--The envelope itself was likewise
full.--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.<eos>: 78.54610976403977
It was dated
from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--

     "Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the
     apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments,
     or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to
     you.<eos>: 53.9993136707532
I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling
     myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both,
     cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation,
     and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been
     spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.
     You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your
     attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I
     demand it of your justice.

     "Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
     magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.<eos>: 60.11839433941712
The first mentioned
     was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached
     Mr.<eos>: 42.662842708099475
Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in
     defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,
     ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr.
     Wickham.--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of
     my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who
     had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who
     had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,
     to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could
     be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--But
     from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally
     bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in
     future secured, when the following account of my actions and their
     motives has been read.--If, in the explanation of them which is
     due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which
     may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry.--The
     necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--I
     had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with
     others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other
     young woman in the country.--But it was not till the evening of the
     dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a
     serious attachment.--I had often seen him in love before.--At that
     ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made
     acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that
     Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general
     expectation of their marriage.<eos>: 59.385002938182595
He spoke of it as a certain event,
     of which the time alone could be undecided.<eos>: 40.21518904552847
From that moment I
     observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then
     perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had
     ever witnessed in him.<eos>: 45.28594774998458
Your sister I also watched.--Her look and
     manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any
     symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the
     evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with
     pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
     sentiment.--If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have
     been in an error.<eos>: 67.26109853744559
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make
     the latter probable.--If it be so, if I have been misled by such
     error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been
     unreasonable.<eos>: 55.94061629176576
But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity
     of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given
     the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her
     temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was
     desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will
     venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually
     influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be
     indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial
     conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to
     the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged
     to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my
     own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to
     my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of
     repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to
     an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to
     forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes
     must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother's
     family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that
     total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed
     by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by
     your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you.<eos>: 66.5288421361285
But amidst
     your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your
     displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you
     consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to
     avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally
     bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to
     the sense and disposition of both.--I will only say farther, that
     from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was
     confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me
     before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
     connection.--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,
     as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon
     returning.--The part which I acted, is now to be explained.--His
     sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our
     coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible
     that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly
     resolved on joining him directly in London.--We accordingly
     went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to
     my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--I described, and
     enforced them earnestly.--But, however this remonstrance might have
     staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it
     would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been
     seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your
     sister's indifference.<eos>: 90.64682249109055
He had before believed her to return his
     affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--But Bingley has
     great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment
     than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived
     himself, was no very difficult point.<eos>: 114.3972906046466
To persuade him against
     returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,
     was scarcely the work of a moment.--I cannot blame myself for
     having done thus much.<eos>: 72.15721047860028
There is but one part of my conduct in the
     whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is
     that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to
     conceal from him your sister's being in town.<eos>: 36.27087847618956
I knew it myself, as
     it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant
     of it.--That they might have met without ill consequence, is
     perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough
     extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--Perhaps this
     concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--It is done, however,
     and it was done for the best.--On this subject I have nothing more
     to say, no other apology to offer.<eos>: 65.99644232259323
If I have wounded your sister's
     feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which
     governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have
     not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more
     weighty accusation, of having injured Mr.<eos>: 50.25898505352825
Wickham, I can only
     refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my
     family.<eos>: 31.371934205876645
Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but
     of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one
     witness of undoubted veracity.<eos>: 35.578803843528
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Wickham is the son of a very
     respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the
     Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his
     trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on
     George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore
     liberally bestowed.<eos>: 59.57724467552834
My father supported him at school, and
     afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own
     father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have
     been unable to give him a gentleman's education.<eos>: 38.1609386389073
My father was not
     only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always
     engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the
     church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.
     As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think
     of him in a very different manner.<eos>: 55.50903457839034
The vicious propensities--the
     want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge
     of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man
     of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of
     seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.<eos>: 35.59073588840467
Darcy could not have.
     Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.
     But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr.<eos>: 98.7947743042367
Wickham has created, a
     suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his
     real character.<eos>: 66.4641742709191
It adds even another motive.<eos>: 45.02774726320544
My excellent father
     died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr.<eos>: 31.697937676598098
Wickham was to
     the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it
     to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his
     profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a
     valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became
     vacant.<eos>: 78.97273376489984
There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.<eos>: 17.992871190693833
His own
     father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these
     events, Mr.<eos>: 44.235957425224235
Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally
     resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it
     unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary
     advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be
     benefited.<eos>: 55.326870270695494
He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,
     and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
     be a very insufficient support therein.<eos>: 42.82844201333603
I rather wished, than
     believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to
     accede to his proposal.<eos>: 45.289442867644105
I knew that Mr.<eos>: 8.88202718527907
Wickham ought not to be a
     clergyman.<eos>: 29.248745687124856
The business was therefore soon settled.<eos>: 75.12174287905978
He resigned all
     claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could
     ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three
     thousand pounds.<eos>: 70.94385862189868
All connection between us seemed now dissolved.<eos>: 75.77799569713125
I
     thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his
     society in town.<eos>: 41.6860777963319
In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his
     studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all
     restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.<eos>: 57.872453364816685
For
     about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the
     incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied
     to me again by letter for the presentation.<eos>: 42.30522163683657
His circumstances, he
     assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were
     exceedingly bad.<eos>: 40.578012746974366
He had found the law a most unprofitable study,
     and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would
     present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there
     could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other
     person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered
     father's intentions.<eos>: 60.98559353938375
You will hardly blame me for refusing to
     comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.
     His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his
     circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me
     to others, as in his reproaches to myself.<eos>: 46.171870517004216
After this period, every
     appearance of acquaintance was dropt.<eos>: 34.26965718855041
How he lived I know not.<eos>: 35.684764741589056
But
     last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.<eos>: 69.61373456281788
I
     must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget
     myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce
     me to unfold to any human being.<eos>: 72.57334356217622
Having said thus much, I feel no
     doubt of your secrecy.<eos>: 48.539728028405605
My sister, who is more than ten years my
     junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel
     Fitzwilliam, and myself.<eos>: 35.86240504240371
About a year ago, she was taken from
     school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last
     summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;
     and thither also went Mr.<eos>: 57.96084397758976
Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there
     proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.
     Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by
     her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,
     whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his
     kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe
     herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.<eos>: 62.542661608112326
She was then but
     fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her
     imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to
     herself.<eos>: 44.92740730187673
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the
     intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea
     of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
     a father, acknowledged the whole to me.<eos>: 94.86591409125168
You may imagine what I felt
     and how I acted.<eos>: 46.349281968162934
Regard for my sister's credit and feelings
     prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr.<eos>: 46.01886524692038
Wickham, who left
     the place immediately, and Mrs.<eos>: 20.22013036115281
Younge was of course removed from
     her charge.<eos>: 77.29418841843756
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my
     sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot
     help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a
     strong inducement.<eos>: 44.83472239785367
His revenge would have been complete indeed.
     This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we
     have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject
     it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty
     towards Mr.<eos>: 36.60918317846115
Wickham.<eos>: 3.5668334354334417
I know not in what manner, under what form of
     falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to
     be wondered at.<eos>: 90.52989538584504
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing
     concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and
     suspicion certainly not in your inclination.<eos>: 49.97263332955112
You may possibly
     wonder why all this was not told you last night.<eos>: 85.11015795086107
But I was not then
     master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.
     For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more
     particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our
     near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of
     the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted
     with every particular of these transactions.<eos>: 64.02630345346205
If your abhorrence of
     _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented
     by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may
     be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find
     some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course
     of the morning.<eos>: 40.73312894815851
I will only add, God bless you.

     "FITZWILLIAM DARCY."




CHAPTER XIII.


If Elizabeth, when Mr.<eos>: 57.48548111943379
Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents.<eos>: 47.39244418033001
But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.<eos>: 85.13034646210632
With amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.<eos>: 61.86746507450453
With a strong
prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of
what had happened at Netherfield.<eos>: 66.66684388422121
She read, with an eagerness which
hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing
what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the
sense of the one before her eyes.<eos>: 59.56801408440423
His belief of her sister's
insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of
the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have
any wish of doing him justice.<eos>: 42.11394365968509
He expressed no regret for what he had
done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.<eos>: 50.14566783776796
It
was all pride and insolence.

But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.<eos>: 37.89033725863599
Wickham, when
she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings
were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.<eos>: 61.23108999242996
She wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false!
This cannot be!<eos>: 46.64536754591515
This must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again.

In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly
what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr.<eos>: 51.67082946731665
Darcy,
though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his
own words.<eos>: 75.81792639515767
So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to
the will, the difference was great.<eos>: 80.17704279091791
What Wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err.<eos>: 41.19383278555573
But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.<eos>: 62.83688093019286
She put down the
letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
little success.<eos>: 50.25673924805832
On both sides it was only assertion.<eos>: 30.88955887923071
Again she read on.
But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to
render Mr.<eos>: 54.564041809608916
Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.

The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to
Mr.<eos>: 34.96882058631345
Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
bring no proof of its injustice.<eos>: 61.24755888834462
She had never heard of him before his
entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance.<eos>: 53.36173798979837
Of his former way of life,
nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself.<eos>: 48.854164533682415
As to
his real character, had information been in her power, she had never
felt a wish of enquiring.<eos>: 41.37149621559197
His countenance, voice, and manner, had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue.<eos>: 66.40837747412147
She tried to
recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.
Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr.<eos>: 25.98448583733387
Darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance.<eos>: 19.676533337742693
But no
such recollection befriended her.<eos>: 54.27665741132046
She could see him instantly before
her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.<eos>: 37.944610271484876
After
pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
read.<eos>: 92.9619445181461
But, alas!<eos>: 18.636188069683456
the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy,
received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no
reason to question.<eos>: 59.736732937926575
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr.<eos>: 27.380253612784237
Darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
cousin's corroboration.

She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation
between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr.<eos>: 43.25201597858846
Philips's.
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.<eos>: 56.70755355858618
She was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before.<eos>: 41.03981953497942
She saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct.<eos>: 28.77124184187699
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing Mr.<eos>: 24.04759948043244
Darcy--that Mr.<eos>: 8.75967343066589
Darcy might leave the country, but that
_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball
the very next week.<eos>: 66.10217620255314
She remembered also, that till the Netherfield
family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where
discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr.
Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the
father, would always prevent his exposing the son.

How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned!
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shewn.<eos>: 64.25256225292168
Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr.<eos>: 20.689131221839133
Darcy, she could not
but allow that Mr.<eos>: 16.941640219566867
Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits.<eos>: 52.48505999413318
That among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of
his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling.<eos>: 84.60337615536592
That had
his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as Mr.<eos>: 63.93417634380801
Bingley, was incomprehensible.

She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--Of neither Darcy nor Wickham
could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,
prejudiced, absurd.

"How despicably have I acted!" she cried.--"I, who have prided myself on
my discernment!--I, who have valued myself on my abilities!<eos>: 84.13203011731922
who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my
vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--How humiliating is this
discovery!--Yet, how just a humiliation!--Had I been in love, I could
not have been more wretchedly blind.<eos>: 56.231750406547
But vanity, not love, has been my
folly.--Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were
concerned.<eos>: 76.76795310435365
Till this moment, I never knew myself."

From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that Mr.<eos>: 70.23428909977108
Darcy's explanation
_there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.<eos>: 38.213828157106484
Widely
different was the effect of a second perusal.--How could she deny that
credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally
unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help
remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been.--Neither could she
deny the justice of his description of Jane.--She felt that Jane's
feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a
constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great
sensibility.

When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
of shame was severe.<eos>: 57.831491525285024
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as
having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers.

The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt.<eos>: 59.719562017029936
It soothed,
but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus
self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that
Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she
had ever known before.

After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities,
and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and
so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her
at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of
appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.

She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each
called during her absence; Mr.<eos>: 59.14223781068571
Darcy, only for a few minutes to take
leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found.--Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in
missing him; she really rejoiced at it.<eos>: 60.36053483890412
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no
longer an object.<eos>: 25.517568281334395
She could think only of her letter.




CHAPTER XIV.


The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr.<eos>: 26.82989516182979
Collins having
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings.<eos>: 91.36907506288962
To Rosings he then
hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return,
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship,
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her.

Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting, that had
she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her
future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
ladyship's indignation would have been.<eos>: 41.673866169821366
"What would she have said?--how
would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself.

Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.--"I assure
you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe nobody
feels the loss of friends so much as I do.<eos>: 55.31571191356096
But I am particularly
attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to
me!--They were excessively sorry to go!<eos>: 50.76999267291902
But so they always are.<eos>: 72.39839945068104
The dear
colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year.<eos>: 162.11787995778633
His
attachment to Rosings, certainly increases."

Mr.<eos>: 37.4064635397903
Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.

Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of
spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,

"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you
may stay a little longer.<eos>: 51.11013858811314
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Collins will be very glad of your
company, I am sure."

"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied
Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it.--I must be in town
next Saturday."

"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.<eos>: 33.93799216421523
I expected
you to stay two months.<eos>: 46.566576582719925
I told Mrs.<eos>: 11.411023355951684
Collins so before you came.<eos>: 30.711246989347952
There
can be no occasion for your going so soon.<eos>: 39.92982018679749
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight."

"But my father cannot.--He wrote last week to hurry my return."

"Oh!<eos>: 80.33695577689647
your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.--Daughters
are never of so much consequence to a father.<eos>: 145.33114432421198
And if you will stay
another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as
Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room
for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I
should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."

"You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our
original plan."

Lady Catherine seemed resigned.

"Mrs.<eos>: 45.99267023117551
Collins, you must send a servant with them.<eos>: 22.23961923538276
You know I always
speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling
post by themselves.<eos>: 71.1587022211032
It is highly improper.<eos>: 13.78385038699599
You must contrive to send
somebody.<eos>: 25.350616434981603
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of
thing.--Young women should always be properly guarded and attended,
according to their situation in life.<eos>: 85.19703723127765
When my niece Georgiana went to
Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go
with her.--Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr.<eos>: 85.96865292203462
Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady
Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--I
am excessively attentive to all those things.<eos>: 74.9260373650246
You must send John with
the young ladies, Mrs.<eos>: 20.161533976744444
Collins.<eos>: 3.406007001821786
I am glad it occurred to me to mention
it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone."

"My uncle is to send a servant for us."

"Oh!--Your uncle!--He keeps a man-servant, does he?--I am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of those things.<eos>: 50.12198011437955
Where shall you change
horses?--Oh!<eos>: 96.25614226434726
Bromley, of course.--If you mention my name at the Bell,
you will be attended to."

Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,
which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so
occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.<eos>: 63.59587761686955
Reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk,
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections.

Mr.<eos>: 62.79518490126903
Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.<eos>: 40.06039124652854
She
studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different.<eos>: 88.0726110573593
When she remembered the style of his address,
she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she
could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or
feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.<eos>: 68.6011281961883
In her own past
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in
the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.
They were hopeless of remedy.<eos>: 44.00247379404991
Her father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.<eos>: 44.7208856513815
Elizabeth had frequently
united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine
and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement?<eos>: 86.26264290105775
Catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would
scarcely give them a hearing.<eos>: 33.16222073851404
They were ignorant, idle, and vain.<eos>: 35.870198351128614
While
there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for
ever.

Anxiety on Jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr.
Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good
opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.<eos>: 46.04690898873627
His affection was
proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame,
unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his
friend.<eos>: 49.45149126689946
How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so
desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for
happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own
family!

When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.

Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay, as they had been at first.<eos>: 63.78948313989719
The very last evening was spent
there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.

When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;
and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
hand to both.




CHAPTER XV.


On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr.<eos>: 51.333179591479094
Collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.

"I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs.<eos>: 37.925730600349546
Collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it.<eos>: 59.15334554134349
The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you.<eos>: 51.201063704696665
We know
how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode.<eos>: 40.156146524404384
Our plain
manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we
see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly."

Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.<eos>: 68.50897797010968
She had
spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_
feel the obliged.<eos>: 78.08126709672038
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling
solemnity replied,

"It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your
time not disagreeably.<eos>: 45.26504222831769
We have certainly done our best; and most
fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior
society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of
varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that
your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.<eos>: 93.27737114638128
Our situation
with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of
extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.<eos>: 93.85901568369479
You see on
what a footing we are.<eos>: 33.000429970218725
You see how continually we are engaged there.<eos>: 58.31089676015489
In
truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble
parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of
compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings."

Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.

"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
Hertfordshire, my dear cousin.<eos>: 54.68268953721772
I flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so.<eos>: 26.391258977444245
Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs.<eos>: 20.202179525173804
Collins you
have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
as well to be silent.<eos>: 53.98846626240585
Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,
that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage.<eos>: 71.89004220126034
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of
thinking.<eos>: 69.21789845523186
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us.<eos>: 62.57197746818447
We seem to have been designed for each
other."

Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.<eos>: 54.66931117886887
She was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
whom they sprung.<eos>: 28.351950915937543
Poor Charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to
such society!--But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though
evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to
ask for compassion.<eos>: 56.540912186204075
Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her
poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their
charms.

At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.<eos>: 39.44756379291337
After an affectionate
parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
Mr.<eos>: 47.743523704626924
Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning
her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his
compliments to Mr.<eos>: 33.79163241196896
and Mrs.<eos>: 3.8891635654619057
Gardiner, though unknown.<eos>: 37.104808248217104
He then handed her
in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when
he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.

"But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here."

Elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off.

"Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but
a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have
happened!"

"A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.

"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there
twice!--How much I shall have to tell!"

Elizabeth privately added, "And how much I shall have to conceal."

Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr.<eos>: 62.764887425541765
Gardiner's
house, where they were to remain a few days.

Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt
had reserved for them.<eos>: 37.73945254688931
But Jane was to go home with her, and at
Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.

It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for
Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr.<eos>: 50.60009792145617
Darcy's proposals.<eos>: 13.372976204811032
To know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision
in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate;
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister
farther.




CHAPTER XVI.


It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out
together from Gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in Hertfordshire;
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr.<eos>: 57.76427313677755
Bennet's carriage was
to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's
punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up
stairs.<eos>: 35.772112854635125
These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily
employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on
guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber.

After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
"Is not this nice?<eos>: 72.45499115280592
is not this an agreeable surprise?"

"And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia; "but you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there." Then shewing
her purchases: "Look here, I have bought this bonnet.<eos>: 56.861657914924294
I do not think it
is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.<eos>: 37.33797911151217
I shall
pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any
better."

And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, "Oh!<eos>: 35.39129350868078
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I
think it will be very tolerable.<eos>: 55.09838327696502
Besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight."

"Are they indeed?" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.

"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer!<eos>: 46.47436031555852
It would be such a delicious scheme,
and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all.<eos>: 30.536214554657835
Mamma would like to
go too of all things!<eos>: 74.22586644363585
Only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have!"

"Yes," thought Elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,
and completely do for us at once.<eos>: 55.19446308740038
Good Heaven!<eos>: 25.95788272548739
Brighton, and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton."

"Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down to
table.<eos>: 49.885944413526126
"What do you think?<eos>: 12.610494263671827
It is excellent news, capital news, and about
a certain person that we all like."

Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he
need not stay.<eos>: 67.95481051761058
Lydia laughed, and said,

"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.<eos>: 26.625524275902677
You thought the
waiter must not hear, as if he cared!<eos>: 52.63825712213321
I dare say he often hears worse
things said than I am going to say.<eos>: 59.111346529897695
But he is an ugly fellow!<eos>: 21.609232493647887
I am glad
he is gone.<eos>: 19.521988282385106
I never saw such a long chin in my life.<eos>: 20.569147253616784
Well, but now for
my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King.<eos>: 79.99812661843204
There's for you!<eos>: 32.21268123659906
She
is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay.<eos>: 45.626223842953586
Wickham is safe."

"And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune."

"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."

"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane.

"I am sure there is not on _his_.<eos>: 42.860856439108225
I will answer for it he never cared
three straws about her.<eos>: 75.12179533102004
Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled
thing?"

Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied
liberal!

As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and
Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.

"How nicely we are crammed in!" cried Lydia.<eos>: 39.299202298933075
"I am glad I bought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox!<eos>: 33.64507956453621
Well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home.<eos>: 57.87963495255739
And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all,
since you went away.<eos>: 38.72779754421217
Have you seen any pleasant men?<eos>: 45.56568531395018
Have you had any
flirting?<eos>: 27.053404870045597
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back.<eos>: 43.43157803091474
Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.
She is almost three and twenty!<eos>: 73.74724296194394
Lord, how ashamed I should be of not
being married before three and twenty!<eos>: 95.60263770475943
My aunt Philips wants you so to
get husbands, you can't think.<eos>: 87.54706160765387
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.
Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it.<eos>: 48.72693753489977
Lord!
how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would
chaperon you about to all the balls.<eos>: 47.957770860893255
Dear me!<eos>: 20.467729847316072
we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's.<eos>: 54.344536411916486
Kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and Mrs.<eos>: 29.265371781516958
Forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening; (by the bye, Mrs.<eos>: 30.432433245656014
Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so
she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?<eos>: 60.6919206836954
We
dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a
lady,--only think what fun!<eos>: 141.66617772326208
Not a soul knew of it, but Col.<eos>: 27.296101284995714
and Mrs.
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!<eos>: 34.93176329368346
When Denny,
and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
did not know him in the least.<eos>: 41.31430708454733
Lord!<eos>: 4.648124186635672
how I laughed!<eos>: 45.705171631420434
and so did Mrs.
Forster.<eos>: 51.965618928564574
I thought I should have died.<eos>: 13.906617134633528
And _that_ made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."

With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia,
assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to Longbourn.<eos>: 52.82366426091683
Elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.

Their reception at home was most kind.<eos>: 39.7834589580993
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr.<eos>: 61.57300829461271
Bennet
say voluntarily to Elizabeth,

"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."

Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases
came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects
which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table,
after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs.<eos>: 78.15613663720956
Bennet was
doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present
fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,
retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice
rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various
pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.

"Oh!<eos>: 52.3565187115938
Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended
there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if
Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we
behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest
cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have
treated you too.<eos>: 50.73739816333907
And then when we came away it was such fun!<eos>: 73.31316521344624
I thought
we never should have got into the coach.<eos>: 39.448760002045475
I was ready to die of laughter.
And then we were so merry all the way home!<eos>: 42.024104789372096
we talked and laughed so
loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!"

To this, Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear sister,
to depreciate such pleasures.<eos>: 71.3944176184397
They would doubtless be congenial with
the generality of female minds.<eos>: 17.165838189291907
But I confess they would have no charms
for _me_.<eos>: 27.59761549198642
I should infinitely prefer a book."

But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.<eos>: 68.49629795297187
She seldom listened to any
body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.

In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to
Meryton and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed
the scheme.<eos>: 52.83793947084595
It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at
home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.<eos>: 30.308514812651765
There was
another reason too for her opposition.<eos>: 35.64150103669014
She dreaded seeing Wickham again,
and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.<eos>: 38.78161452832359
The comfort to _her_,
of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression.<eos>: 49.11333844147224
In
a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be
nothing more to plague her on his account.

She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton
scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents.<eos>: 56.867698792253506
Elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.




CHAPTER XVII.


Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no
longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular
in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,
she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.
Darcy and herself.

Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.<eos>: 41.73002886641315
She was
sorry that Mr.<eos>: 13.032089781534664
Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.

"His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment."

"Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him; but he has
other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"

"Blame you!<eos>: 49.33940812485182
Oh, no."

"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham."

"No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."

"But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very
next day."

She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned George Wickham.<eos>: 56.1234554228645
What a stroke was this for poor Jane!
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here
collected in one individual.<eos>: 58.719271909446256
Nor was Darcy's vindication, though
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
seek to clear one, without involving the other.

"This will not do," said Elizabeth.<eos>: 43.458099028572036
"You never will be able to make both
of them good for any thing.<eos>: 32.667453838927294
Take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one.<eos>: 26.503560181639777
There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much.<eos>: 60.427769103957814
For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.
Darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse."

It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.

"I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she.<eos>: 27.470485081002813
"Wickham so
very bad!<eos>: 40.09189116082891
It is almost past belief.<eos>: 102.45960725694631
And poor Mr.<eos>: 9.503356844032513
Darcy!<eos>: 7.10072669940854
dear Lizzy, only
consider what he must have suffered.<eos>: 32.83942904753775
Such a disappointment!<eos>: 41.11415486295949
and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion too!<eos>: 102.21737142198819
and having to relate such a thing of
his sister!<eos>: 41.01757944005664
It is really too distressing.<eos>: 46.488789218461456
I am sure you must feel it
so."

"Oh!<eos>: 12.628313768087615
no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so
full of both.<eos>: 97.9525912052777
I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.<eos>: 38.30025037211616
Your profusion
makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will
be as light as a feather."

"Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance!<eos>: 51.92799448035056
such an openness and gentleness in his manner."

"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men.<eos>: 36.62588877366164
One has got all the goodness, and the other all the
appearance of it."

"I never thought Mr.<eos>: 38.34812392155537
Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
used to do."

"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason.<eos>: 56.31339922821281
It is such a spur to one's genius, such an
opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind.<eos>: 44.08875484193728
One may be continually
abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty."

"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now."

"Indeed I could not.<eos>: 58.896358474059255
I was uncomfortable enough.<eos>: 18.776333117867132
I was very
uncomfortable, I may say unhappy.<eos>: 33.339028437027274
And with no one to speak to, of what I
felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and
vain and nonsensical as I knew I had!<eos>: 75.85457185156842
Oh!<eos>: 4.7344512948191735
how I wanted you!"

"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of Wickham to Mr.<eos>: 53.13156248163904
Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
undeserved."

"Certainly.<eos>: 59.52312033972914
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging.<eos>: 44.5146481618358
There is
one point, on which I want your advice.<eos>: 49.107727857461164
I want to be told whether I
ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand
Wickham's character."

Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, "Surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.<eos>: 55.298655562066884
What is your own opinion?"

"That it ought not to be attempted.<eos>: 24.804876658826828
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy has not authorised me to
make his communication public.<eos>: 47.13776062859952
On the contrary every particular relative
to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and
if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who
will believe me?<eos>: 42.56781139764783
The general prejudice against Mr.<eos>: 37.96738894237493
Darcy is so violent,
that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to
attempt to place him in an amiable light.<eos>: 51.45800062282742
I am not equal to it.<eos>: 17.322278911998776
Wickham
will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here,
what he really is.<eos>: 44.395943158407675
Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we
may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.<eos>: 60.51451896027614
At present I will
say nothing about it."

"You are quite right.<eos>: 28.64052137163657
To have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever.<eos>: 97.2774041673724
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
re-establish a character.<eos>: 48.294022779315725
We must not make him desperate."

The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.<eos>: 16.568784241366718
She had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish
to talk again of either.<eos>: 40.07003938768037
But there was still something lurking behind,
of which prudence forbad the disclosure.<eos>: 36.553732970196684
She dared not relate the other
half of Mr.<eos>: 34.61652769841706
Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by his friend.<eos>: 38.468419429870764
Here was knowledge in which no one could
partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this
last incumbrance of mystery.<eos>: 82.6497982672014
"And then," said she, "if that very
improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell
what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.<eos>: 67.42904403623305
The
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"

She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister's spirits.<eos>: 72.95446742476119
Jane was not happy.<eos>: 15.507982674110199
She still cherished a
very tender affection for Bingley.<eos>: 27.865610083926345
Having never even fancied herself in
love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from
her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often
boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to
every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the
feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those
regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their
tranquillity.

"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs.<eos>: 50.33378464811966
Bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of
this sad business of Jane's?<eos>: 53.15300638564262
For my part, I am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody.<eos>: 41.07009315826306
I told my sister Philips so the other day.<eos>: 43.10652549442524
But I
cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London.<eos>: 34.52278031600297
Well, he is a
very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now.<eos>: 38.56502095408688
There is no talk of his
coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every
body too, who is likely to know."

"I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more."

"Oh, well!<eos>: 32.736337006598994
it is just as he chooses.<eos>: 17.581858473249714
Nobody wants him to come.<eos>: 19.99368834976001
Though I
shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was
her, I would not have put up with it.<eos>: 44.71396484732207
Well, my comfort is, I am sure
Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he
has done."

But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,
she made no answer.

"Well, Lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the
Collinses live very comfortable, do they?<eos>: 49.87793166555493
Well, well, I only hope it
will last.<eos>: 43.0306128688515
And what sort of table do they keep?<eos>: 153.4800769042771
Charlotte is an
excellent manager, I dare say.<eos>: 23.850512014490683
If she is half as sharp as her mother,
she is saving enough.<eos>: 21.48918776786019
There is nothing extravagant in _their_
housekeeping, I dare say."

"No, nothing at all."

"A great deal of good management, depend upon it.<eos>: 24.807573933300244
Yes, yes.<eos>: 12.697819459145135
_They_ will
take care not to outrun their income.<eos>: 54.141185536358556
_They_ will never be distressed
for money.<eos>: 44.50500874135653
Well, much good may it do them!<eos>: 158.59377728453035
And so, I suppose, they often
talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead.<eos>: 62.794474245744254
They look upon it
quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens."

"It was a subject which they could not mention before me."

"No.<eos>: 43.20432245137184
It would have been strange if they had.<eos>: 29.06059810756597
But I make no doubt, they
often talk of it between themselves.<eos>: 58.86697218619004
Well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.<eos>: 60.49024369696505
_I_ should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."




CHAPTER XVIII.


The first week of their return was soon gone.<eos>: 49.63659233654755
The second began.<eos>: 43.36921389577756
It was
the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in
the neighbourhood were drooping apace.<eos>: 23.73138526605831
The dejection was almost
universal.<eos>: 22.575499520239706
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.<eos>: 43.197157314846805
Very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and
Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any of the family.

"Good Heaven!<eos>: 65.05058677572848
What is to become of us!<eos>: 30.86012067849616
What are we to do!" would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.<eos>: 54.98220670427037
"How can you be smiling so,
Lizzy?"

Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years
ago.

"I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel
Millar's regiment went away.<eos>: 57.644110530133766
I thought I should have broke my heart."

"I am sure I shall break _mine_," said Lydia.

"If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs.<eos>: 22.51015582094226
Bennet.

"Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton!<eos>: 31.738092762715187
But papa is so
disagreeable."

"A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever."

"And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,"
added Kitty.

Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
Longbourn-house.<eos>: 58.29365429939924
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame.<eos>: 32.12794254834291
She felt anew the justice of Mr.<eos>: 15.24728852989679
Darcy's
objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend.

But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from Mrs.<eos>: 38.41442211423557
Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the
regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.<eos>: 32.34156295183519
This invaluable friend was a
very young woman, and very lately married.<eos>: 36.02017284923202
A resemblance in good humour
and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of
their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.

The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs.<eos>: 56.1465911429339
Forster,
the delight of Mrs.<eos>: 12.640645029625697
Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely
to be described.<eos>: 33.552737603016524
Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew
about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.

"I cannot see why Mrs.<eos>: 43.355659017928076
Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,"
said she, "though I am _not_ her particular friend.<eos>: 28.840670240180536
I have just as much
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older."

In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make
her resigned.<eos>: 58.496201080617155
As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she
considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it
known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go.<eos>: 58.9669179916815
She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as Mrs.<eos>: 31.80921134898781
Forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home.<eos>: 47.88351968872241
He heard her attentively, and then said,

"Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances."

"If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to
us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and
imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you
would judge differently in the affair."

"Already arisen!" repeated Mr.<eos>: 47.353345027785565
Bennet.<eos>: 3.342542937173585
"What, has she frightened away
some of your lovers?<eos>: 62.153554436584436
Poor little Lizzy!<eos>: 31.24618227558416
But do not be cast down.<eos>: 16.930211941410292
Such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity,
are not worth a regret.<eos>: 48.11370804480586
Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows
who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly."

"Indeed you are mistaken.<eos>: 28.959595077317864
I have no such injuries to resent.<eos>: 11.224904224559413
It is not
of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining.<eos>: 34.89087238011135
Our
importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
Lydia's character.<eos>: 38.89950742958221
Excuse me--for I must speak plainly.<eos>: 52.545156617517506
If you, my dear
father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.<eos>: 30.441271204557772
Her character
will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself and her family ridiculous.<eos>: 61.29884435934799
A flirt too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of
her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.<eos>: 59.614596371257456
In this danger Kitty
is also comprehended.<eos>: 59.863925382957504
She will follow wherever Lydia leads.<eos>: 59.36805386797179
Vain,
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled!<eos>: 42.95960412451948
Oh!<eos>: 4.7344512948191735
my dear father, can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace?"

Mr.<eos>: 37.214351102181304
Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and
affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,

"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love.<eos>: 44.05352776594672
Wherever you and Jane are known,
you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three very silly
sisters.<eos>: 61.41900907434713
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to
Brighton.<eos>: 38.19064128141402
Let her go then.<eos>: 30.250996608331025
Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will
keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to any body.<eos>: 33.94505705076508
At Brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here.<eos>: 74.9879835119726
The officers will find
women better worth their notice.<eos>: 109.0034704283466
Let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance.<eos>: 44.16012795663725
At any rate, she cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest
of her life."

With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.<eos>: 47.34357780000721
It was not
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.
She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over
unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
disposition.

Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility.<eos>: 48.85095452186615
In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness.<eos>: 23.058955949492976
She saw with the creative eye of
fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers.<eos>: 42.14527820245254
She
saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at
present unknown.<eos>: 39.18569570551595
She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she
saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once.

Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and
such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?<eos>: 44.55279725056685
They could
have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the
same.<eos>: 33.4877709379965
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the
melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there
himself.

But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving
home.

Elizabeth was now to see Mr.<eos>: 44.92491053093944
Wickham for the last time.<eos>: 15.473442752967404
Having been
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.<eos>: 99.00915241572781
She had even
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,
an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.<eos>: 39.027753592022016
In his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her.<eos>: 54.60069045149638
She lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.

On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined
with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some
enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she
mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr.<eos>: 73.08285839690551
Darcy's having both spent three
weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.

He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's
recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man,
asked her how she had liked him.<eos>: 51.62220700755033
Her answer was warmly in his favour.
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, "How long did you
say that he was at Rosings?"

"Nearly three weeks."

"And you saw him frequently?"

"Yes, almost every day."

"His manners are very different from his cousin's."

"Yes, very different.<eos>: 45.86231343482061
But I think Mr.<eos>: 12.122291849893836
Darcy improves on acquaintance."

"Indeed!" cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her.<eos>: 40.51398592107658
"And pray
may I ask?" but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "Is it in
address that he improves?<eos>: 40.123728985222236
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his
ordinary style?<eos>: 82.11276508378619
for I dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more
serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials."

"Oh, no!" said Elizabeth.<eos>: 25.20332359389167
"In essentials, I believe, he is very much
what he ever was."

While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.<eos>: 61.23758153123334
There was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention, while she added,

"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that
either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from
knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."

Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
accents,

"You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr.<eos>: 67.69672875912138
Darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the _appearance_ of what is right.<eos>: 58.79152102653426
His pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter
him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by.<eos>: 51.4263188090504
I only fear that
the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding,
is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and
judgment he stands much in awe.<eos>: 47.88866305862305
His fear of her, has always operated, I
know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his
wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he
has very much at heart."

Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head.<eos>: 35.69829208779087
She saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
him.<eos>: 27.314268832836753
The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,
of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish
Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again.

When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs.<eos>: 61.49538198815283
Forster to Meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning.<eos>: 45.95824230126484
The separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.<eos>: 41.981577030460336
Kitty was the
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.<eos>: 48.99259296949267
Mrs.
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there
was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous
happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus
of her sisters were uttered without being heard.




CHAPTER XIX.


Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort.<eos>: 41.254525932612744
Her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her.<eos>: 115.28628508607315
Respect,
esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of
domestic happiness were overthrown.<eos>: 48.76645444419256
But Mr.<eos>: 3.76683742908994
Bennet was not of a
disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.<eos>: 113.90976298318502
He was fond of
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments.<eos>: 37.951415723328736
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.<eos>: 87.01241154983566
This is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.

Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
father's behaviour as a husband.<eos>: 92.97715989395913
She had always seen it with pain; but
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children, was so highly reprehensible.<eos>: 39.49871973794634
But she had never felt so
strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils
arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly
used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,
even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.

When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.<eos>: 77.93270534532643
Their parties
abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around
them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her
folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering
place and a camp.<eos>: 65.18939880544832
Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been
sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward
with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself.<eos>: 94.04016546314864
It was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment.<eos>: 70.39177077320089
Her tour to the Lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her
mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in
the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.

"But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to wish for.
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realized.<eos>: 56.12013999410559
A scheme of which every part promises delight, can
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation."

When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
always very short.<eos>: 61.908056452500205
Those to her mother, contained little else, than that
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as Mrs.<eos>: 57.8434571929156
Forster called her, and they were going to the
camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less
to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much
too full of lines under the words to be made public.

After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good
humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn.<eos>: 69.04327850171315
Everything wore
a happier aspect.<eos>: 13.995290119646642
The families who had been in town for the winter came
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.<eos>: 68.11724583971046
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June
Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by
the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in
Meryton.

The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast
approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
arrived from Mrs.<eos>: 66.38751511872998
Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent.<eos>: 66.61913693859748
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again
within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire.<eos>: 53.93256734124851
In that
county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three
weeks; and to Mrs.<eos>: 25.78736697426755
Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.<eos>: 21.903364430957048
The
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,
Dovedale, or the Peak.

Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing
the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.<eos>: 40.90528237889849
But it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again.

With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.<eos>: 71.60252805712877
It was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its
owner.<eos>: 44.724144711469194
"But surely," said she, "I may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."

The period of expectation was now doubled.<eos>: 36.454848756790504
Four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunt's arrival.<eos>: 31.454802359257176
But they did pass away, and Mr.<eos>: 19.64889395589959
and
Mrs.<eos>: 3.8891635654619057
Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
Longbourn.<eos>: 41.88741197347234
The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.

The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next
morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.<eos>: 82.70523830920804
One
enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a
suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad.

It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &c.<eos>: 72.64811325184138
are
sufficiently known.<eos>: 34.019531462280106
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present
concern.<eos>: 49.155956714184356
To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs.<eos>: 32.234238981078455
Gardiner's
former residence, and where she had lately learned that some
acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen
all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of
Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated.<eos>: 49.97966113840114
It
was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.<eos>: 58.08270692051513
In
talking over their route the evening before, Mrs.<eos>: 33.48318956473756
Gardiner expressed an
inclination to see the place again.<eos>: 41.20478223851493
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Gardiner declared his
willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.

"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so
much?" said her aunt.<eos>: 37.252851420448785
"A place too, with which so many of your
acquaintance are connected.<eos>: 58.33587429627384
Wickham passed all his youth there, you
know."

Elizabeth was distressed.<eos>: 78.3615223499121
She felt that she had no business at
Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.<eos>: 20.562434644478117
She
must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many,
she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.

Mrs.<eos>: 49.15335037231347
Gardiner abused her stupidity.<eos>: 10.235731631197071
"If it were merely a fine house
richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it myself; but the
grounds are delightful.<eos>: 36.5810261766045
They have some of the finest woods in the
country."

Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce.<eos>: 33.81151869598477
The
possibility of meeting Mr.<eos>: 15.53040250230984
Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
occurred.<eos>: 44.83861940045332
It would be dreadful!<eos>: 23.083070700100055
She blushed at the very idea; and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run
such a risk.<eos>: 60.181114134815
But against this, there were objections; and she finally
resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as
to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.

Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its
proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer.<eos>: 56.79867039120146
A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her
alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme.

To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.

PRIDE & PREJUDICE.




CHAPTER I.


Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.

The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.<eos>: 52.88981864271718
They
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.

Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view.<eos>: 57.64521714346754
They gradually ascended for
half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which
the road with some abruptness wound.<eos>: 45.074038907235106
It was a large, handsome, stone
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high
woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.<eos>: 49.50352917372426
Its banks
were neither formal, nor falsely adorned.<eos>: 51.934546453918266
Elizabeth was delighted.<eos>: 15.874863375540603
She
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.<eos>: 77.42430707644043
They were
all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that
to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!

They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of
meeting its owner returned.<eos>: 58.85256826714056
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken.<eos>: 35.38103146775883
On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was.

The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.<eos>: 58.85744385385147
They
followed her into the dining-parlour.<eos>: 20.0111169329214
It was a large, well-proportioned
room, handsomely fitted up.<eos>: 38.37249525241745
Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its prospect.<eos>: 42.044825415207505
The hill, crowned with wood, from
which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the
distance, was a beautiful object.<eos>: 60.98768287548851
Every disposition of the ground was
good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered
on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace
it, with delight.<eos>: 27.363381857531373
As they passed into other rooms, these objects were
taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to
be seen.<eos>: 77.62952703024803
The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable
to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration
of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of
splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.

"And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress!<eos>: 44.600406487552
With
these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!<eos>: 73.3797854686814
Instead of
viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--But no,"--recollecting
herself,--"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost
to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them."

This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.

She longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really
absent, but had not courage for it.<eos>: 66.43463968863372
At length, however, the question was
asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.<eos>: 23.710908543277505
Reynolds
replied, that he was, adding, "but we expect him to-morrow, with a
large party of friends." How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!

Her aunt now called her to look at a picture.<eos>: 84.94914107755835
She approached, and saw
the likeness of Mr.<eos>: 11.413165905886997
Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures,
over the mantle-piece.<eos>: 38.42778963743032
Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a
young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been
brought up by him at his own expence.--"He is now gone into the army,"
she added, "but I am afraid he has turned out very wild."

Mrs.<eos>: 38.401926981900836
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not
return it.

"And that," said Mrs.<eos>: 22.547626202221643
Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
"is my master--and very like him.<eos>: 41.686519196840464
It was drawn at the same time as the
other--about eight years ago."

"I have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs.<eos>: 39.066945651501285
Gardiner,
looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face.<eos>: 39.24904529383886
But, Lizzy, you can tell
us whether it is like or not."

Mrs.<eos>: 38.789684268440865
Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master.

"Does that young lady know Mr.<eos>: 58.13296010052446
Darcy?"

Elizabeth coloured, and said--"A little."

"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?"

"Yes, very handsome."

"I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you
will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.<eos>: 56.84671428422315
This room was my late
master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then.<eos>: 58.77144116340518
He was very fond of them."

This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr.<eos>: 28.648843082164387
Wickham's being among them.

Mrs.<eos>: 15.082573517579927
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn
when she was only eight years old.

"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mr.<eos>: 55.30309086576298
Gardiner.

"Oh!<eos>: 6.300666404630556
yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long.<eos>: 69.43615279854905
In the next room is a
new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she
comes here to-morrow with him."

Mr.<eos>: 92.63642249673993
Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs.<eos>: 52.06314647580739
Reynolds, either
from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister.

"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"

"Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his
time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months."

"Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate."

"If your master would marry, you might see more of him."

"Yes, Sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be.<eos>: 43.30721314971485
I do not know who is
good enough for him."

Mr.<eos>: 21.124506732727266
and Mrs.<eos>: 3.8891635654619057
Gardiner smiled.<eos>: 10.880108864965004
Elizabeth could not help saying, "It is
very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so."

"I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows
him," replied the other.<eos>: 28.602723004186792
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,
"I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him
ever since he was four years old."

This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
ideas.<eos>: 74.2491298971202
That he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest
opinion.<eos>: 29.07516841922994
Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more,
and was grateful to her uncle for saying,

"There are very few people of whom so much can be said.<eos>: 52.20916555394122
You are lucky in
having such a master."

"Yes, Sir, I know I am.<eos>: 29.69700013910028
If I was to go through the world, I could not
meet with a better.<eos>: 27.72440127416746
But I have always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he
was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the
world."

Elizabeth almost stared at her.--"Can this be Mr.<eos>: 76.90357299666
Darcy!" thought she.

"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs.<eos>: 23.264956076002893
Gardiner.

"Yes, Ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just
as affable to the poor."

Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.<eos>: 47.88775023081951
Mrs.
Reynolds could interest her on no other point.<eos>: 51.215388515512295
She related the subject
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture, in vain.<eos>: 16.28834388304475
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.

"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever
lived.<eos>: 50.82784584566272
Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but
themselves.<eos>: 114.42348641661181
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will
give him a good name.<eos>: 45.76183468253453
Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never
saw any thing of it.<eos>: 24.02544768550952
To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle
away like other young men."

"In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought Elizabeth.

"This fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."

"Perhaps we might be deceived."

"That is not very likely; our authority was too good."

On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very
pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and
lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but
just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the
room, when last at Pemberley.

"He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards
one of the windows.

Mrs.<eos>: 51.64878292209844
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter
the room.<eos>: 18.741520022098076
"And this is always the way with him," she added.--"Whatever
can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment.<eos>: 49.10866184908035
There
is nothing he would not do for her."

The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were
all that remained to be shewn.<eos>: 77.74984562589168
In the former were many good paintings;
but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss
Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
also more intelligible.

In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger.<eos>: 47.45239521030234
Elizabeth walked on in quest
of the only face whose features would be known to her.<eos>: 59.98090098779283
At last it
arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr.<eos>: 25.131220086097326
Darcy, with
such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,
when he looked at her.<eos>: 36.92854231323143
She stood several minutes before the picture in
earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the
gallery.<eos>: 60.29582721803605
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his
father's life time.

There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of
their acquaintance.<eos>: 30.699149518951895
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs.<eos>: 52.21931205388074
Reynolds
was of no trifling nature.<eos>: 47.025645726537945
What praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant?<eos>: 67.35515213891462
As a brother, a landlord, a master, she
considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--How
much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--How much of
good or evil must be done by him!<eos>: 61.94528216118673
Every idea that had been brought
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she
stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes
upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and
softened its impropriety of expression.

When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.

As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back
to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was
conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.

They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.<eos>: 53.14240841991002
Their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest
blush.<eos>: 26.215406940199756
He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from
surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
of perfect civility.

She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach,
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome.<eos>: 63.197942695038286
Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw Mr.<eos>: 65.98559842990923
Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on
beholding his master, must immediately have told it.<eos>: 40.82522143607897
They stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she
returned to his civil enquiries after her family.<eos>: 66.16156258847286
Amazed at the
alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he
uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few
minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most
uncomfortable of her life.<eos>: 67.38005911225153
Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he
spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his
enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay
in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts.

At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few
moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took
leave.

The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his
figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own
feelings, followed them in silence.<eos>: 59.149956471361605
She was overpowered by shame and
vexation.<eos>: 18.276229654665162
Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged
thing in the world!<eos>: 59.971612029137134
How strange must it appear to him!<eos>: 58.251938698379526
In what a
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!<eos>: 180.00208463137437
It might seem as if
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again!<eos>: 73.80608367464237
Oh!<eos>: 4.7344512948191735
why did she come?
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?<eos>: 95.66112023529413
Had they been
only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.<eos>: 46.858609210765515
She blushed again and
again over the perverseness of the meeting.<eos>: 51.646223366678235
And his behaviour, so
strikingly altered,--what could it mean?<eos>: 65.1905122604175
That he should even speak to
her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her
family!<eos>: 51.25478214851203
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,
never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when
he put his letter into her hand!<eos>: 82.47099869831571
She knew not what to think, nor how to
account for it.

They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time
before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed
to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
distinguished no part of the scene.<eos>: 54.939898218614296
Her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr.<eos>: 56.42742869959371
Darcy then
was.<eos>: 22.16000546016449
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in
what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing,
she was still dear to him.<eos>: 46.2160683742613
Perhaps he had been civil, only because he
felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was
not like ease.<eos>: 60.679081762678294
Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure.

At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.

They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening
of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of
the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods
overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.<eos>: 50.98240148320668
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Gardiner
expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be
beyond a walk.<eos>: 54.54161271549078
With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten
miles round.<eos>: 30.14534578831109
It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed
circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among
hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.
They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of
the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and
the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered
it.<eos>: 40.91399775501491
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed
the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs.<eos>: 27.374968985052718
Gardiner,
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of
returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.<eos>: 34.3982383399571
Her niece was,
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
progress was slow, for Mr.<eos>: 36.83611540821606
Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man
about them, that he advanced but little.<eos>: 45.440601275212934
Whilst wandering on in this
slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was
quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr.<eos>: 26.28239234045544
Darcy
approaching them, and at no great distance.<eos>: 38.0703171532166
The walk being here less
sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they
met.<eos>: 60.08255756547419
Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an
interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them.<eos>: 46.73987364426951
For a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.<eos>: 30.869468486441992
This idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them.<eos>: 128.68354786461785
With a glance she saw,
that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his
politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;
but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when
some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of
Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed.<eos>: 55.25458477879427
Her colour
changed, and she said no more.

Mrs.<eos>: 30.553949852575325
Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and
she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had
revolted, in his offer to herself.<eos>: 42.12004089666578
"What will be his surprise," thought
she, "when he knows who they are!<eos>: 46.39668776536186
He takes them now for people of
fashion."

The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions.<eos>: 58.05081476472565
That he was _surprised_ by the
connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so
far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
conversation with Mr.<eos>: 44.68128676133991
Gardiner.<eos>: 3.9410746666968075
Elizabeth could not but be pleased,
could not but triumph.<eos>: 48.7962300788224
It was consoling, that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush.<eos>: 37.00306848801803
She listened most
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
his taste, or his good manners.

The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr.<eos>: 56.45036662532295
Darcy
invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same
time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport.<eos>: 49.019885349154585
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Gardiner, who was
walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her
wonder.<eos>: 36.74672949945333
Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the
compliment must be all for herself.<eos>: 62.37528504998941
Her astonishment, however, was
extreme; and continually was she repeating, "Why is he so altered?<eos>: 52.663094418659036
From
what can it proceed?<eos>: 42.722442443661386
It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake
that his manners are thus softened.<eos>: 82.39498962895863
My reproofs at Hunsford could not
work such a change as this.<eos>: 66.85473569103254
It is impossible that he should still love
me."

After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the
brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.<eos>: 48.42953413291449
It originated in
Mrs.<eos>: 10.534806405457097
Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
her husband's.<eos>: 23.012762014225295
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together.<eos>: 32.694187302597534
After a short silence, the lady first spoke.<eos>: 36.9492616340344
She wished him to
know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we
left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in
the country." He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.<eos>: 56.463021946344696
"They
will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr.<eos>: 62.68716862754072
Bingley and his sisters."

Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.<eos>: 36.1703942941471
Her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when Mr.<eos>: 54.30714248952981
Bingley's name had been last mentioned
between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was
not very differently engaged.

"There is also one other person in the party," he continued after a
pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--Will you allow
me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at Lambton?"

The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.<eos>: 63.58350669138253
She immediately felt
that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,
must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her.

They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought.<eos>: 81.17471685755011
Elizabeth
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
pleased.<eos>: 47.06373802581322
His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of
the highest kind.<eos>: 27.999736790485752
They soon outstripped the others, and when they had
reached the carriage, Mr.<eos>: 18.050047386101635
and Mrs.<eos>: 3.8891635654619057
Gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind.

He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn.<eos>: 43.189268293379115
At such a time, much might
have been said, and silence was very awkward.<eos>: 47.78379076251658
She wanted to talk, but
there seemed an embargo on every subject.<eos>: 32.324434625695794
At last she recollected that
she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with
great perseverance.<eos>: 31.233376131666187
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience
and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over.<eos>: 102.22361016001783
On
Mr.<eos>: 3.2435414822219437
and Mrs.<eos>: 3.8891635654619057
Gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the
house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted
on each side with the utmost politeness.<eos>: 44.617629266144746
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy handed the ladies
into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking
slowly towards the house.

The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.
"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.

"There _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her
aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.<eos>: 35.73449693665362
I can now
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,
_I_ have seen nothing of it."

"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.<eos>: 48.62694269805924
It was more
than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
attention.<eos>: 42.01734364712451
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling."

"To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as Wickham;
or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are
perfectly good.<eos>: 38.38331281301676
But how came you to tell us that he was so
disagreeable?"

Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning.

"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied
her uncle.<eos>: 44.304613284877256
"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him
at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and
warn me off his grounds."

Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said
nothing.

"From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs.<eos>: 63.258208354165184
Gardiner, "I really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
any body, as he has done by poor Wickham.<eos>: 34.62251508561514
He has not an ill-natured
look.<eos>: 33.55582878930578
On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when
he speaks.<eos>: 37.99408044596358
And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that
would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.<eos>: 38.27861743015365
But to be sure,
the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming
character!<eos>: 57.87975129199333
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.<eos>: 77.10043171246467
But he is a
liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant
comprehends every virtue."

Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as
guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his
relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different
construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire.<eos>: 51.57860377595929
In
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.

Mrs.<eos>: 33.82810902170851
Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of
any thing else.<eos>: 50.30091629189524
Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had
no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an
intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.

The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
but think, and think with wonder, of Mr.<eos>: 55.033618375592916
Darcy's civility, and above
all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.




CHAPTER II.


Elizabeth had settled it that Mr.<eos>: 26.842916308031928
Darcy would bring his sister to visit
her, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own
arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.<eos>: 63.49978917355485
They had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a
curricle, driving up the street.<eos>: 51.41684181571557
Elizabeth immediately recognising the
livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise
to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected.<eos>: 34.92256508302921
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
the business.<eos>: 52.073755593171505
Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt
that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such
a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece.<eos>: 65.68316830625753
While these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing.<eos>: 32.14747348289578
She was quite amazed
at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she
dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in
her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.

She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks
of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.

Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place.<eos>: 72.78410619383286
With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.<eos>: 86.48591228053454
Since her
being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was
only exceedingly shy.<eos>: 29.47822381926753
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable.

Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though
little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
womanly and graceful.<eos>: 48.13506826104922
She was less handsome than her brother, but there
was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle.<eos>: 36.43102231137427
Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr.<eos>: 25.84733512511994
Darcy had been, was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings.

They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was
also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step
was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.<eos>: 48.5759699475683
All
Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she
still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the
unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her
again.<eos>: 66.26156227876098
He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family,
and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever
done.

To Mr.<eos>: 62.89696159602578
and Mrs.<eos>: 3.8891635654619057
Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself.<eos>: 34.31295482153905
They had long wished to see him.<eos>: 18.421137317003094
The whole party before
them, indeed, excited a lively attention.<eos>: 43.43410824927366
The suspicions which had just
arisen of Mr.<eos>: 19.52514364195079
Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards
each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from
those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what
it was to love.<eos>: 108.56287190577919
Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in
doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough.

Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.<eos>: 50.98586582696776
She wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.<eos>: 50.062447562268
Bingley
was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.

In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!
how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a
like manner.<eos>: 70.53388751484805
Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that
as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.<eos>: 76.72192058876786
But, though
this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour
to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane.<eos>: 29.54437552664918
No look appeared
on either side that spoke particular regard.<eos>: 184.75874339320703
Nothing occurred between
them that could justify the hopes of his sister.<eos>: 48.34017505870824
On this point she was
soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they
parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of
Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that
might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.<eos>: 67.50432017730895
He observed to her, at a
moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had
something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had
the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "It
is above eight months.<eos>: 53.074436599828616
We have not met since the 26th of November, when
we were all dancing together at Netherfield."

Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,
whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn.<eos>: 47.58083474920444
There was not much in the
question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner
which gave them meaning.

It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr.<eos>: 36.10180058527473
Darcy himself; but,
whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far
removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however
temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.<eos>: 51.791787885131555
When
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion
of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the
very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last
lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so
great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly
restrain her astonishment from being visible.<eos>: 62.744188353260895
Never, even in the company
of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at
Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could
result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and
Rosings.

Their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose
to depart, Mr.<eos>: 70.39995814679283
Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing Mr.<eos>: 38.91661027075985
and Mrs.<eos>: 3.8891635654619057
Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner
at Pemberley, before they left the country.<eos>: 24.34327561439858
Miss Darcy, though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
readily obeyed.<eos>: 44.22479408373748
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.<eos>: 147.78570330077832
Presuming, however,
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than
any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.

Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to
make after all their Hertfordshire friends.<eos>: 53.94301682271876
Elizabeth, construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on
this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors
left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some
satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been
little.<eos>: 57.81271426402558
Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.

But she had no reason to fear Mr.<eos>: 37.09970731178113
and Mrs.<eos>: 3.8891635654619057
Gardiner's curiosity; it was
not their wish to force her communication.<eos>: 37.3687612852491
It was evident thahopet she was
much better acquainted with Mr.<eos>: 43.412951658177924
Darcy than they had before any idea of;
it was evident that he was very much in love with her.<eos>: 29.837436815848886
They saw much to
interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.

Of Mr.<eos>: 56.240608394295684
Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.<eos>: 52.72734803167267
They could
not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known,
would not have recognised it for Mr.<eos>: 40.32574439644378
Darcy.<eos>: 5.0362465464125075
There was now an interest,
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible,
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
hastily rejected.<eos>: 59.11733563264844
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of
their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight.<eos>: 83.33953468627348
They
had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if
not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small
market-town, where the family did not visit.<eos>: 41.311631837538506
It was acknowledged,
however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.

With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the
son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known
fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
him, which Mr.<eos>: 60.206761944209546
Darcy afterwards discharged.

As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than
the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and
she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out.<eos>: 66.19574572660828
She
certainly did not hate him.<eos>: 23.121497349035895
No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
that could be so called.<eos>: 76.1492915855746
The respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his
favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced.<eos>: 61.52127721903354
But above all, above respect and esteem,
there was a motive within her of good will which could not be
overlooked.<eos>: 90.27074348639565
It was gratitude.--Gratitude, not merely for having once
loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the
petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the
unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.<eos>: 49.3837293543002
He who, she had been
persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this
accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without
any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where
their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion
of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.<eos>: 47.07049883775272
Such a
change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but
gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such
its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means
unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.<eos>: 71.54545088990474
She respected, she
esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his
welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to
depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both
that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still
possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.

It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that
such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very
day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late
breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by
some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it
would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following
morning.<eos>: 45.04753240801179
They were, therefore, to go.--Elizabeth was pleased, though,
when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.

Mr.<eos>: 35.61633234867618
Gardiner left them soon after breakfast.<eos>: 53.68710134872877
The fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.




CHAPTER III.


Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had
originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome
her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with
how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be
renewed.

On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.<eos>: 63.32925363434274
Its windows
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.

In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there
with Mrs.<eos>: 39.92352233078125
Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
London.<eos>: 28.862438668356454
Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with
all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the
fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves
inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved.<eos>: 90.08729389834187
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Gardiner and
her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.

By Mrs.<eos>: 26.65401538854119
Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments.<eos>: 48.98306220982557
It was first broken by Mrs.<eos>: 25.498905763504386
Annesley, a
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the
others; and between her and Mrs.<eos>: 54.71164320132411
Gardiner, with occasional help from
Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.<eos>: 58.82732082186014
Miss Darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.

Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,
and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without
calling her attention.<eos>: 50.858819299018414
This observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much.<eos>: 42.19843648039017
Her own thoughts were employing her.<eos>: 34.33619093896594
She expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.<eos>: 49.88287828737113
She wished, she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.<eos>: 56.44616869400329
After
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss
Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
enquiry after the health of her family.<eos>: 49.958198744858116
She answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.

The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a
significant look and smile from Mrs.<eos>: 52.406900547793526
Annesley to Miss Darcy had been
given, to remind her of her post.<eos>: 25.558368192010974
There was now employment for the whole
party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected
them round the table.

While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.<eos>: 42.41712853244098
Darcy, by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came.

He had been some time with Mr.<eos>: 38.97691196864898
Gardiner, who, with two or three other
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
Georgiana that morning.<eos>: 64.59321775483632
No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room.<eos>: 58.899343770480485
In no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to Mr.<eos>: 57.519313648537455
Darcy were by no means over.<eos>: 36.96554437363158
Miss Darcy, on her brother's
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.<eos>: 34.387435475242725
Miss
Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,

"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?
They must be a great loss to _your_ family."

In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;
but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone.<eos>: 44.035231606347125
While
she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.<eos>: 61.263726051197004
Had Miss Bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have
refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
Darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and
absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that
corps.<eos>: 42.235781697017195
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated
elopement.<eos>: 32.303143502844
To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was
possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her
brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish
which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
hereafter her own.<eos>: 64.0666060723285
He had certainly formed such a plan, and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss
Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend.

Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more.<eos>: 63.833907016488546
Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have
fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.

Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer
above-mentioned; and while Mr.<eos>: 67.50201662915258
Darcy was attending them to their
carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on
Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress.<eos>: 43.292994304302916
But Georgiana would not join
her.<eos>: 22.631938483155405
Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his
judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as
to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than
lovely and amiable.<eos>: 38.92687491625273
When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley
could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to
his sister.

"How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr.<eos>: 42.56086085592527
Darcy," she cried; "I
never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.
She is grown so brown and coarse!<eos>: 56.355614401067044
Louisa and I were agreeing that we
should not have known her again."

However little Mr.<eos>: 41.07837215744806
Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer.

"For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never could see
any beauty in her.<eos>: 46.60026758059022
Her face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.<eos>: 65.43299435821906
Her nose wants
character; there is nothing marked in its lines.<eos>: 98.13670035037624
Her teeth are
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which
have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing
extraordinary in them.<eos>: 55.725116306862695
They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not
like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion, which is intolerable."

Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
success she expected.<eos>: 56.87433465228227
He was resolutely silent however; and, from a
determination of making him speak, she continued,

"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect
your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_
a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she
seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time."

"Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but _that_
was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."

He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.

Mrs.<eos>: 71.07311642768114
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during
their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested
them both.<eos>: 68.72460158447724
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were
discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.
They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every
thing but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs.<eos>: 53.58076604704458
Gardiner
thought of him, and Mrs.<eos>: 12.523832825759198
Gardiner would have been highly gratified by
her niece's beginning the subject.




CHAPTER IV.


Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
Jane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had
been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but
on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the
receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
it had been missent elsewhere.<eos>: 46.60137883696988
Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.

They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her
uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themselves.<eos>: 68.15931588577222
The one missent must be first attended to; it had been
written five days ago.<eos>: 58.576018640373476
The beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence.<eos>: 83.06152899807063
It was to this effect:

     "Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of
     a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming
     you--be assured that we are all well.<eos>: 95.47794596478184
What I have to say relates to
     poor Lydia.<eos>: 26.97684193943194
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were
     all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was
     gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,
     with Wickham!--Imagine our surprise.<eos>: 103.30753867710551
To Kitty, however, it does not
     seem so wholly unexpected.<eos>: 36.66251908574946
I am very, very sorry.<eos>: 45.05138334361958
So imprudent a
     match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that
     his character has been misunderstood.<eos>: 54.213816117602654
Thoughtless and indiscreet I
     can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it)
     marks nothing bad at heart.<eos>: 113.55512432796479
His choice is disinterested at least,
     for he must know my father can give her nothing.<eos>: 46.850121066080874
Our poor mother
     is sadly grieved.<eos>: 37.50393480546491
My father bears it better.<eos>: 21.42577733778593
How thankful am I,
     that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must
     forget it ourselves.<eos>: 91.18931906060705
They were off Saturday night about twelve, as
     is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
     eight.<eos>: 99.95120261911404
The express was sent off directly.<eos>: 82.64956420114737
My dear Lizzy, they must
     have passed within ten miles of us.<eos>: 39.495964980729525
Colonel Forster gives us reason
     to expect him here soon.<eos>: 55.700989669622054
Lydia left a few lines for his wife,
     informing her of their intention.<eos>: 34.54494905424217
I must conclude, for I cannot be
     long from my poor mother.<eos>: 31.976747241833227
I am afraid you will not be able to make
     it out, but I hardly know what I have written."

Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.

     "By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried
     letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not
     confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer
     for being coherent.<eos>: 55.04540181279854
Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would
     write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.
     Imprudent as a marriage between Mr.<eos>: 48.329584913159415
Wickham and our poor Lydia
     would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for
     there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.
     Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day
     before, not many hours after the express.<eos>: 95.1126046821521
Though Lydia's short
     letter to Mrs.<eos>: 16.91747176284134
F.<eos>: 1.3429090450981507
gave them to understand that they were going to
     Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief
     that W.<eos>: 47.22104503990819
never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which
     was repeated to Colonel F.<eos>: 45.87553659512998
who instantly taking the alarm, set off
     from B.<eos>: 52.20991794974891
intending to trace their route.<eos>: 7.166744907266434
He did trace them easily to
     Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed
     into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them
     from Epsom.<eos>: 74.63971597678258
All that is known after this is, that they were seen
     to continue the London road.<eos>: 80.2312623471413
I know not what to think.<eos>: 25.436282005039168
After making
     every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F.<eos>: 138.27612952206167
came on into
     Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at
     the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such
     people had been seen to pass through.<eos>: 37.385000624399126
With the kindest concern he
     came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner
     most creditable to his heart.<eos>: 33.005263705806904
I am sincerely grieved for him and
     Mrs.<eos>: 31.373417277830892
F.<eos>: 1.3429090450981507
but no one can throw any blame on them.<eos>: 82.48395683169677
Our distress, my
     dear Lizzy, is very great.<eos>: 24.420525810741847
My father and mother believe the worst,
     but I cannot think so ill of him.<eos>: 51.59963704632875
Many circumstances might make it
     more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to
     pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design
     against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely,
     can I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible.<eos>: 78.27857156657852
I grieve to
     find, however, that Colonel F.<eos>: 21.48668106657381
is not disposed to depend upon their
     marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he
     feared W.<eos>: 74.09020826433186
was not a man to be trusted.<eos>: 23.57851114897481
My poor mother is really ill
     and keeps her room.<eos>: 44.21018585044401
Could she exert herself it would be better, but
     this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life
     saw him so affected.<eos>: 34.421322753130866
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed
     their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot
     wonder.<eos>: 102.96655043565822
I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared
     something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock
     is over, shall I own that I long for your return?<eos>: 58.67044992546198
I am not so
     selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.<eos>: 24.562406795994455
Adieu.<eos>: 2.287366512317687
I
     take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,
     but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging
     you all to come here, as soon as possible.<eos>: 49.42084959121104
I know my dear uncle and
     aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have
     still something more to ask of the former.<eos>: 31.361551885550416
My father is going to
     London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her.<eos>: 50.86170664188247
What
     he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress
     will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest
     way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again
     to-morrow evening.<eos>: 38.78182533072392
In such an exigence my uncle's advice and
     assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately
     comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness."

"Oh!<eos>: 38.84470531262242
where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a
moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was
opened by a servant, and Mr.<eos>: 30.989646498878162
Darcy appeared.<eos>: 9.388177919151996
Her pale face and impetuous
manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to
speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's
situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.
I must find Mr.<eos>: 49.88490318335493
Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be
delayed; I have not an instant to lose."

"Good God!<eos>: 100.69026108824634
what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a minute,
but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr.<eos>: 52.13216133185619
and Mrs.<eos>: 3.8891635654619057
Gardiner.<eos>: 3.9410746666968075
You are
not well enough;--you cannot go yourself."

Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.<eos>: 36.98769500993728
Calling back
the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an
accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
mistress home, instantly.

On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
"Let me call your maid.<eos>: 44.633827603091525
Is there nothing you could take, to give you
present relief?--A glass of wine;--shall I get you one?--You are very
ill."

"No, I thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.<eos>: 55.513076270642756
"There
is nothing the matter with me.<eos>: 16.44710367107244
I am quite well.<eos>: 12.51494359704085
I am only distressed by
some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn."

She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word.<eos>: 59.81310570514106
Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate
silence.<eos>: 52.53959361432518
At length, she spoke again.<eos>: 16.2825724189989
"I have just had a letter from
Jane, with such dreadful news.<eos>: 46.07757312963646
It cannot be concealed from any one.<eos>: 28.665886851535447
My
youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown
herself into the power of--of Mr.<eos>: 86.48165816679256
Wickham.<eos>: 3.5668334354334417
They are gone off together
from Brighton.<eos>: 35.754989510101744
_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest.<eos>: 46.10036483198226
She has no
money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for
ever."

Darcy was fixed in astonishment.<eos>: 80.1541288281684
"When I consider," she added, in a yet
more agitated voice, "that _I_ might have prevented it!--_I_ who knew
what he was.<eos>: 56.10245624832721
Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what
I learnt, to my own family!<eos>: 81.80529964986175
Had his character been known, this could not
have happened.<eos>: 40.191939200970516
But it is all, all too late now."

"I am grieved, indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved--shocked.<eos>: 49.8168880473805
But is it
certain, absolutely certain?"

"Oh yes!--They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced
almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to
Scotland."

"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"

"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's
immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour.<eos>: 61.02213624119924
But
nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done.<eos>: 36.726632069653604
How is
such a man to be worked on?<eos>: 23.293200593980252
How are they even to be discovered?<eos>: 48.266544212315296
I have
not the smallest hope.<eos>: 20.869292457247642
It is every way horrible!"

Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.

"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--Oh!<eos>: 65.56429422731824
had I known what
I ought, what I dared, to do!<eos>: 51.47180213094932
But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too
much.<eos>: 35.9778187161843
Wretched, wretched, mistake!"

Darcy made no answer.<eos>: 72.09239343103496
He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up
and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air
gloomy.<eos>: 51.255119220500546
Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.<eos>: 36.10771511003988
Her power
was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family
weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.<eos>: 54.78400298618443
She could neither
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.<eos>: 40.17766444284658
It
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him, as now, when all love must be vain.

But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.<eos>: 49.92360025923543
Lydia--the
humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up
every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the
voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my
stay, but real, though unavailing, concern.<eos>: 49.794234744071645
Would to heaven that any
thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer
consolation to such distress.--But I will not torment you with vain
wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.<eos>: 131.48437512608575
This
unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure
of seeing you at Pemberley to-day."

"Oh, yes.<eos>: 45.39325520253365
Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy.<eos>: 27.150891124150796
Say that
urgent business calls us home immediately.<eos>: 95.3343161670297
Conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible.--I know it cannot be long."

He readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for
her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only
one serious, parting, look, went away.

As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had
marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of
contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination.

If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.<eos>: 75.99413391834901
But if
otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a
first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,
and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment.<eos>: 70.72010393838349
Be that as it may, she saw him go
with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must
produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business.<eos>: 75.21749899655768
Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained
a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her.<eos>: 46.968775610812976
No one but Jane, she thought,
could flatter herself with such an expectation.<eos>: 54.30100521257117
Surprise was the least
of her feelings on this developement.<eos>: 23.288036676406932
While the contents of the first
letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that
Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for
money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared
incomprehensible.<eos>: 71.23701752105654
But now it was all too natural.<eos>: 45.91525823982143
For such an attachment
as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not
suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the
intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither
her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy
prey.

She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that
Lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body.<eos>: 52.96038936162891
Sometimes one
officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions
raised them in her opinion.<eos>: 90.22224469209107
Her affections had been continually
fluctuating, but never without an object.<eos>: 51.45968354397012
The mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--Oh!<eos>: 77.83612653402056
how acutely did she now
feel it.

She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to
share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost
importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience
was severe.<eos>: 59.11675916260364
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
and Mrs.<eos>: 3.8891635654619057
Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,
by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but
satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the
cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on
the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had
never been a favourite with them, Mr.<eos>: 56.75989853906994
and Mrs.<eos>: 3.8891635654619057
Gardiner could not but be
deeply affected.<eos>: 47.7301910811393
Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after
the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr.<eos>: 30.703067862698
Gardiner readily
promised every assistance in his power.--Elizabeth, though expecting no
less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated
by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily
settled.<eos>: 92.02692299756536
They were to be off as soon as possible.<eos>: 17.27590020974682
"But what is to be
done about Pemberley?" cried Mrs.<eos>: 22.746913077978203
Gardiner.<eos>: 3.9410746666968075
"John told us Mr.<eos>: 24.65885740926526
Darcy was
here when you sent for us;--was it so?"

"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.
_That_ is all settled."

"That is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
prepare.<eos>: 65.68380133083656
"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth!<eos>: 78.38350847247334
Oh, that I knew how it was!"

But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour.<eos>: 81.9900439507167
Had Elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their
sudden departure.<eos>: 60.383789571716385
An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.
Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing
remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of
the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.




CHAPTER V.


"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much
more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the
matter.<eos>: 43.72160639226028
It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I
am strongly inclined to hope the best.<eos>: 58.774706277158124
Could he expect that her friends
would not step forward?<eos>: 61.34974754717292
Could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?<eos>: 36.319240197381504
His temptation is
not adequate to the risk."

"Do you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.

"Upon my word," said Mrs.<eos>: 27.38675642618747
Gardiner, "I begin to be of your uncle's
opinion.<eos>: 14.072365002399087
It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
interest, for him to be guilty of it.<eos>: 32.60508187825544
I cannot think so very ill of
Wickham.<eos>: 28.555235671428125
Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe
him capable of it?"

"Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest.<eos>: 44.56210614800567
But of every other neglect
I can believe him capable.<eos>: 64.4491094571568
If, indeed, it should be so!<eos>: 22.570971822525888
But I dare not
hope it.<eos>: 23.223183044593416
Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the
case?"

"In the first place," replied Mr.<eos>: 32.21557870636375
Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to Scotland."

"Oh!<eos>: 17.938585324986082
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a
presumption!<eos>: 41.78150939518462
And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
Barnet road."

"Well, then--supposing them to be in London.<eos>: 31.737026092783715
They may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose.<eos>: 29.144982792840942
It is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland."

"But why all this secrecy?<eos>: 57.20131594850994
Why any fear of detection?<eos>: 23.70382119451847
Why must their
marriage be private?<eos>: 146.59691612851586
Oh!<eos>: 4.7344512948191735
no, no, this is not likely.<eos>: 31.15834993154207
His most particular
friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her.<eos>: 49.59641655211721
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money.<eos>: 58.18797130437362
He
cannot afford it.<eos>: 21.725945358543026
And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she
beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake,
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?<eos>: 120.53600520807761
As to what
restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.<eos>: 57.59153244192533
But as to your
other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.<eos>: 53.02974699522153
Lydia has no
brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter."

"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him,
as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?"

"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied Elizabeth, with
tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt.<eos>: 54.62732598509377
But, really, I know not what to say.
Perhaps I am not doing her justice.<eos>: 40.39622330647144
But she is very young; she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,
nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity.<eos>: 77.4068942530822
She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.
Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation, and officers, have been in her head.<eos>: 44.07694646290351
She has been doing
every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall I call it?<eos>: 61.771214598191115
susceptibility to her feelings; which are
naturally lively enough.<eos>: 59.48183594830664
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman."

"But you see that Jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of
Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt."

"Of whom does Jane ever think ill?<eos>: 56.686248314906216
And who is there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,
till it were proved against them?<eos>: 75.72324352567131
But Jane knows, as well as I do, what
Wickham really is.<eos>: 51.22769532699349
We both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word.<eos>: 21.760062130726258
That he has neither integrity nor honour.<eos>: 32.10065095380265
That he is
as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating."

"And do you really know all this?" cried Mrs.<eos>: 27.292092623384818
Gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.

"I do, indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring.<eos>: 27.564923899158718
"I told you the other day,
of his infamous behaviour to Mr.<eos>: 17.85514185060958
Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at
Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him.<eos>: 58.18148573499816
And there are other
circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.<eos>: 68.70245123150505
From
what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl.<eos>: 47.86282779194797
Yet he knew to the contrary himself.<eos>: 43.46349410438196
He
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her."

"But does Lydia know nothing of this?<eos>: 43.225330315167966
Can she be ignorant of what you
and Jane seem so well to understand?"

"Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all.<eos>: 49.24072599301517
Till I was in Kent, and saw
so much both of Mr.<eos>: 32.56324850042739
Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was
ignorant of the truth myself.<eos>: 38.14366411959231
And when I returned home, the ----shire
was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time.<eos>: 53.00476084358612
As that was the
case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it
apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?<eos>: 86.35593464165353
And even when it
was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs.<eos>: 41.00993595804502
Forster, the necessity of
opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.<eos>: 44.926332417339644
That _she_ could
be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.<eos>: 78.67613546709742
That such a
consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far
enough from my thoughts."

"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I
suppose, to believe them fond of each other."

"Not the slightest.<eos>: 49.39724529281949
I can remember no symptom of affection on either
side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away.<eos>: 42.1236594252113
When first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were.<eos>: 59.01397791260059
Every girl in, or near Meryton, was out of her senses about him
for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any
particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of
extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others
of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her
favourites."

       *       *       *       *       *

It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by
its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
the whole of the journey.<eos>: 82.88762786494101
From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find
no interval of ease or forgetfulness.

They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on
the road, reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day.<eos>: 50.58354720881588
It was a
comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations.

The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the
carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.

Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs
from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.

Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been
heard of the fugitives.

"Not yet," replied Jane.<eos>: 42.67617111512603
"But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope
every thing will be well."

"Is my father in town?"

"Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word."

"And have you heard from him often?"

"We have heard only once.<eos>: 45.81760745356703
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I
particularly begged him to do.<eos>: 50.92740630974612
He merely added, that he should not write
again, till he had something of importance to mention."

"And my mother--How is she?<eos>: 50.21599951109013
How are you all?"

"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly
shaken.<eos>: 40.41929607613037
She is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all.<eos>: 39.36191200931347
She does not yet leave her dressing-room.<eos>: 21.196685858828012
Mary and Kitty, thank
Heaven!<eos>: 54.14117732200902
are quite well."

"But you--How are you?" cried Elizabeth.<eos>: 23.612687817680282
"You look pale.<eos>: 14.93985183271208
How much you
must have gone through!"

Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while Mr.<eos>: 47.33366413443506
and Mrs.<eos>: 3.8891635654619057
Gardiner were
engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of
the whole party.<eos>: 41.41741291118397
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.

When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth
had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
found that Jane had no intelligence to give.<eos>: 44.09258286942205
The sanguine hope of good,
however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet
deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,
to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.

Mrs.<eos>: 48.041541771119114
Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous
conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage;
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must be principally owing.

"If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to Brighton,
with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia
had nobody to take care of her.<eos>: 51.43137868128709
Why did the Forsters ever let her go out
of their sight?<eos>: 79.03621403974643
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had
been well looked after.<eos>: 51.7700811138723
I always thought they were very unfit to have
the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am.<eos>: 48.94603621220519
Poor dear
child!<eos>: 28.247682782586292
And now here's Mr.<eos>: 32.7705750424732
Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight
Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is
to become of us all?<eos>: 38.38766341196043
The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold
in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what
we shall do."

They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr.<eos>: 61.04353890331694
Gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told
her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist
Mr.<eos>: 45.04296288842207
Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.

"Do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.<eos>: 69.95916247961465
In a few days more, we
may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost.<eos>: 53.94325076630334
As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him
come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done."

"Oh!<eos>: 34.56622075152512
my dear brother," replied Mrs.<eos>: 13.716980146887524
Bennet, "that is exactly what I
could most wish for.<eos>: 31.608738457216266
And now do, when you get to town, find them out,
wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them
marry.<eos>: 61.48613283104674
And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them,
after they are married.<eos>: 80.07588341137033
And, above all things, keep Mr.<eos>: 51.480238480884644
Bennet from
fighting.<eos>: 10.566910125850137
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,--that I am frightened
out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me,
such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at
heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.<eos>: 49.892331500357564
And tell my dear
Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen
me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.<eos>: 49.61258965472883
Oh, brother,
how kind you are!<eos>: 46.094042337479166
I know you will contrive it all."

But Mr.<eos>: 15.234770078748443
Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in
her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the
housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.

Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
subject.

In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their
appearance before.<eos>: 49.71189776459097
One came from her books, and the other from her
toilette.<eos>: 27.52436043505126
The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change
was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or
the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given
something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty.<eos>: 40.00694989307555
As
for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth
with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at
table,

"This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.
But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other, the balm of sisterly consolation."

Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false
step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded
in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."

Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to
make any reply.<eos>: 55.77727275391665
Mary, however, continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.

In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an
hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the
opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to
satisfy.<eos>: 45.61244644388486
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss
Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued
the subject, by saying, "But tell me all and every thing about it, which
I have not already heard.<eos>: 55.435140413573194
Give me farther particulars.<eos>: 31.59775953361978
What did Colonel
Forster say?<eos>: 33.07283554999817
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement
took place?<eos>: 80.90602855468124
They must have seen them together for ever."

"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,
especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm.<eos>: 56.1085671045056
I am so
grieved for him.<eos>: 17.043771391464627
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.<eos>: 73.2343191521428
He
_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had
any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension
first got abroad, it hastened his journey."

"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?<eos>: 79.72318681936706
Did he know of
their intending to go off?<eos>: 42.44949561722804
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"

"Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of
their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it.<eos>: 69.7041503243942
He did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am
inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."

"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?"

"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains!<eos>: 59.5489790809237
I felt a
little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in
marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right.<eos>: 42.768889995069884
My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be.<eos>: 103.71204641610151
Kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last
letter, she had prepared her for such a step.<eos>: 51.26034496850427
She had known, it seems,
of their being in love with each other, many weeks."

"But not before they went to Brighton?"

"No, I believe not."

"And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself?<eos>: 45.76819788692862
Does he
know his real character?"

"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly
did.<eos>: 41.23114385257252
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.<eos>: 18.60003853367644
And since this sad
affair has taken place, it is said, that he left Meryton greatly in
debt; but I hope this may be false."

"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
this could not have happened!"

"Perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister.<eos>: 53.44293576948257
"But to expose
the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present
feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.<eos>: 57.08186707931283
We acted with the best intentions."

"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his
wife?"

"He brought it with him for us to see."

Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.<eos>: 42.875077035096744
These
were the contents:

     "MY DEAR HARRIET,

     "You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
     missed.<eos>: 44.237274443638185
I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with
     who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the
     world I love, and he is an angel.<eos>: 31.438820503855716
I should never be happy without
     him, so think it no harm to be off.<eos>: 43.51221537590669
You need not send them word at
     Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the
     surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia
     Wickham.<eos>: 65.79513092501294
What a good joke it will be!<eos>: 37.76918137177801
I can hardly write for
     laughing.<eos>: 40.181222598056245
Pray make my excuses to Pratt, for not keeping my
     engagement, and dancing with him to-night.<eos>: 50.62988283818561
Tell him I hope he will
     excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at
     the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.<eos>: 64.92060496702615
I shall send for my
     clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally
     to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are
     packed up.<eos>: 41.3552269675744
Good bye.<eos>: 13.952879750846993
Give my love to Colonel Forster, I hope you
     will drink to our good journey.

     "Your affectionate friend,

     "LYDIA BENNET."

"Oh!<eos>: 44.582415896103385
thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!" cried Elizabeth when she had
finished it.<eos>: 32.65951593735231
"What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment.<eos>: 31.39281761908107
But
at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a
_scheme_ of infamy.<eos>: 44.99985351472376
My poor father!<eos>: 25.129319275366292
how he must have felt it!"

"I never saw any one so shocked.<eos>: 35.87631942562571
He could not speak a word for full ten
minutes.<eos>: 49.45755472544203
My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!"

"Oh!<eos>: 41.30529636782547
Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"

"I do not know.--I hope there was.--But to be guarded at such a time, is
very difficult.<eos>: 35.833476680959365
My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much
as I might have done!<eos>: 33.008971023326694
But the horror of what might possibly happen,
almost took from me my faculties."

"Your attendance upon her, has been too much for you.<eos>: 50.87468540600658
You do not look
well.<eos>: 17.91502603039311
Oh!<eos>: 4.7344512948191735
that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone."

"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.
Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on.<eos>: 56.630868908336055
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn
on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
Thursday with me.<eos>: 51.35330097137379
She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady
Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if
they could be of use to us."

"She had better have stayed at home," cried Elizabeth; "perhaps she
_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too
little of one's neighbours.<eos>: 54.680815984620565
Assistance is impossible; condolence,
insufferable.<eos>: 20.839053175660972
Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."

She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.

"He meant, I believe," replied Jane, "to go to Epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could
be made out from them.<eos>: 48.98023992746864
His principal object must be, to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham.<eos>: 46.011593117079514
It had come
with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be
remarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham.<eos>: 40.22912647470504
If he could any how
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach.<eos>: 75.0936564524282
I do not know of any
other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this."




CHAPTER VI.


The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr.<eos>: 37.50318535492581
Bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.
His family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion.
They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain.<eos>: 45.537857085340995
Mr.
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.

When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on Mr.<eos>: 59.34652355111341
Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to
the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.

Mrs.<eos>: 26.849627502592227
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
her nieces.<eos>: 49.60535711801782
She shared in their attendance on Mrs.<eos>: 22.39362939460596
Bennet, and was a
great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom.<eos>: 23.973794496565766
Their other aunt also
visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity,
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them.

All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light.<eos>: 50.3509921396054
He was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.
Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;
and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness.<eos>: 26.99792620819733
Elizabeth, though she did not credit above
half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sister's ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still
less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now
come, when if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before
entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some
news of them.

Mr.<eos>: 73.99206696923662
Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a
letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street.
That Mr.<eos>: 54.59690039496343
Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but
without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr.<eos>: 30.521475061292385
Bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
coming to London, before they procured lodgings.<eos>: 65.10604569833544
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.<eos>: 40.55196519223379
He added, that Mr.
Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and
promised to write again very soon.<eos>: 39.181129417540134
There was also a postscript to this
effect.

"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if
possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,
whether Wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to
know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself.<eos>: 48.582928839630675
If there
were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining
such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.<eos>: 38.250272628981755
At present we
have nothing to guide us.<eos>: 29.328873891627396
Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every
thing in his power to satisfy us on this head.<eos>: 33.05132860452303
But, on second thoughts,
perhaps Lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better
than any other person."

Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for
her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any
information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved.

She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and
mother, both of whom had been dead many years.<eos>: 88.27431282386608
It was possible, however,
that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more
information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the
application was a something to look forward to.

Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected.<eos>: 48.57422220574126
The arrival of letters was
the first grand object of every morning's impatience.<eos>: 46.95723668722311
Through letters,
whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.

But before they heard again from Mr.<eos>: 54.9465078475766
Gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from Mr.<eos>: 42.022916012996134
Collins; which, as Jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.<eos>: 71.98062381301489
It was as
follows:

     "MY DEAR SIR,

     "I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
     in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
     suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter
     from Hertfordshire.<eos>: 53.31376434266454
Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs.<eos>: 19.27826102699568
Collins and
     myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable
     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.<eos>: 61.808182703644114
No
     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe
     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that
     must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind.<eos>: 77.01569738156483
The death
     of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.
     And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
     suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness
     of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree
     of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of
     yourself and Mrs.<eos>: 41.52495522039331
Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own
     disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of
     such an enormity, at so early an age.<eos>: 37.160684375434386
Howsoever that may be, you
     are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined
     by Mrs.<eos>: 36.42366490624924
Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter,
     to whom I have related the affair.<eos>: 40.16090530949019
They agree with me in
     apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be
     injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady
     Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves
     with such a family.<eos>: 55.20595368959293
And this consideration leads me moreover to
     reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last
     November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in
     all your sorrow and disgrace.<eos>: 74.23337213997954
Let me advise you then, my dear Sir,
     to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy
     child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the
     fruits of her own heinous offence.

     "I am, dear Sir, &c.<eos>: 34.42320023948216
&c."

Mr.<eos>: 14.630727584930979
Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from
Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept
up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living.
His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the
militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship
with any of them.<eos>: 49.72939690694022
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out,
as likely to give any news of him.<eos>: 55.75740194268615
And in the wretched state of his own
finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to
his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired
that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable
amount.<eos>: 44.42086000947335
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would
be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton.<eos>: 41.95938223465818
He owed a good deal in
the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.<eos>: 35.636674304121335
Mr.
Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn
family; Jane heard them with horror.<eos>: 57.21996732888888
"A gamester!" she cried.<eos>: 17.63605746924568
"This is
wholly unexpected.<eos>: 28.45422461888216
I had not an idea of it."

Mr.<eos>: 13.105510788643308
Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.<eos>: 38.46746952734495
Rendered
spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to
his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and
leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit.<eos>: 43.201888118076106
When Mrs.<eos>: 3.620270452604642
Bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before.

"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia!" she cried.<eos>: 63.09548378463517
"Sure he
will not leave London before he has found them.<eos>: 62.11554651735985
Who is to fight Wickham,
and make him marry her, if he comes away?"

As Mrs.<eos>: 43.402889756381015
Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
and her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr.<eos>: 26.649451463133598
Bennet
came from it.<eos>: 14.8757501898672
The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.

Mrs.<eos>: 39.28988482076424
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her
Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;
and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs.<eos>: 56.50310145955712
Gardiner had formed, of
their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.
Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from
Pemberley.

The present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware,
that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of
Lydia's infamy somewhat better.<eos>: 47.69214662947781
It would have spared her, she thought,
one sleepless night out of two.

When Mr.<eos>: 31.28752062622279
Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure.<eos>: 22.313753719494642
He said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it.

It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that
Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "Say
nothing of that.<eos>: 40.75943411626936
Who should suffer but myself?<eos>: 49.215735286145126
It has been my own doing,
and I ought to feel it."

"You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth.

"You may well warn me against such an evil.<eos>: 29.39292808335344
Human nature is so prone to
fall into it!<eos>: 51.08065612657539
No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have
been to blame.<eos>: 40.795571915015174
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
It will pass away soon enough."

"Do you suppose them to be in London?"

"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"

"And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty.

"She is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there
will probably be of some duration."

Then, after a short silence, he continued, "Lizzy, I bear you no
ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which,
considering the event, shews some greatness of mind."

They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's
tea.

"This is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune!<eos>: 51.25270035811815
Another day I will do the same; I will sit in
my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble
as I can,--or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away."

"I am not going to run away, Papa," said Kitty, fretfully; "if _I_
should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia."

"_You_ go to Brighton!--I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne
for fifty pounds!<eos>: 55.435110984245576
No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it.<eos>: 20.91044181951236
No officer is ever to enter my house
again, nor even to pass through the village.<eos>: 66.32632347606206
Balls will be absolutely
prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.<eos>: 40.91727475157197
And you are
never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten
minutes of every day in a rational manner."

Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.

"Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy.<eos>: 42.086333366375044
If you are a good
girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of
them."




CHAPTER VII.


Two days after Mr.<eos>: 37.38558675295725
Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their
mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,
when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon,
madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask."

"What do you mean, Hill?<eos>: 41.740651947548066
We have heard nothing from town."

"Dear madam," cried Mrs.<eos>: 19.868372818364307
Hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know
there is an express come for master from Mr.<eos>: 51.954877339860204
Gardiner?<eos>: 7.0333117676459755
He has been here
this half hour, and master has had a letter."

Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.<eos>: 137.88326777379038
They
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the
library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said,

"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the
little copse."

Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,
and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.

Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as
Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out,

"Oh, Papa, what news?<eos>: 51.74323604752096
what news?<eos>: 23.900099058723132
have you heard from my uncle?"

"Yes, I have had a letter from him by express."

"Well, and what news does it bring?<eos>: 45.126996846242584
good or bad?"

"What is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from
his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it."

Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.<eos>: 47.37463467102619
Jane now came up.

"Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know myself what it is
about."

     "Gracechurch-street, Monday,

     August 2.

     "MY DEAR BROTHER,

     "At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such
     as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction.<eos>: 37.7034907485754
Soon after
     you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what
     part of London they were.<eos>: 55.3262758623802
The particulars, I reserve till we meet.
     It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them
     both----"

"Then it is, as I always hoped," cried Jane; "they are married!"

     Elizabeth read on; "I have seen them both.<eos>: 51.46491291175811
They are not married,
     nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are
     willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on
     your side, I hope it will not be long before they are.<eos>: 44.04287784478076
All that is
     required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her
     equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your
     children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,
     moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your
     life, one hundred pounds per annum.<eos>: 68.38169242980729
These are conditions, which,
     considering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as
     far as I thought myself privileged, for you.<eos>: 32.53181894840523
I shall send this by
     express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.<eos>: 73.260344566578
You
     will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr.<eos>: 31.600447752776002
Wickham's
     circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to
     be.<eos>: 31.44650863747507
The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to
     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are
     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.
     If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act
     in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will
     immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper
     settlement.<eos>: 71.16941556001606
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming
     to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on
     my diligence and care.<eos>: 47.24736338011903
Send back your answer as soon as you can,
     and be careful to write explicitly.<eos>: 49.269846953555145
We have judged it best, that my
     niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will
     approve.<eos>: 43.14624263504579
She comes to us to-day.<eos>: 32.18364599117804
I shall write again as soon as any
     thing more is determined on.<eos>: 70.8033370466331
Your's, &c.

     "EDW.<eos>: 16.297253470330947
GARDINER."

"Is it possible!" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.<eos>: 21.81597946472102
"Can it be
possible that he will marry her?"

"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her
sister.<eos>: 34.31747496556731
"My dear father, I congratulate you."

"And have you answered the letter?" said Elizabeth.

"No; but it must be done soon."

Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he
wrote.

"Oh!<eos>: 39.11419009321569
my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately.
Consider how important every moment is, in such a case."

"Let me write for you," said Jane, "if you dislike the trouble
yourself."

"I dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done."

And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.

"And may I ask?" said Elizabeth, "but the terms, I suppose, must be
complied with."

"Complied with!<eos>: 37.00309137232654
I am only ashamed of his asking so little."

"And they _must_ marry!<eos>: 42.71648098555435
Yet he is _such_ a man!"

"Yes, yes, they must marry.<eos>: 21.919679508741847
There is nothing else to be done.<eos>: 16.216172500511426
But there
are two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am
ever to pay him."

"Money!<eos>: 75.08680116095965
my uncle!" cried Jane, "what do you mean, Sir?"

"I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after I am
gone."

"That is very true," said Elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me
before.<eos>: 41.67367728246944
His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!<eos>: 42.562295805900604
Oh!
it must be my uncle's doings!<eos>: 19.377734859209973
Generous, good man, I am afraid he has
distressed himself.<eos>: 39.7594006609311
A small sum could not do all this."

"No," said her father, "Wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a
farthing less than ten thousand pounds.<eos>: 33.74281693369338
I should be sorry to think so
ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship."

"Ten thousand pounds!<eos>: 27.91479400352728
Heaven forbid!<eos>: 20.68153850529623
How is half such a sum to be
repaid?"

Mr.<eos>: 25.466343724883902
Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued
silent till they reached the house.<eos>: 66.0727675556018
Their father then went to the
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.

"And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves.<eos>: 26.027619190487318
"How strange this is!<eos>: 40.527774898369564
And for _this_ we are to be
thankful.<eos>: 46.086763350839064
That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice!<eos>: 72.81210394833093
Oh, Lydia!"

"I comfort myself with thinking," replied Jane, "that he certainly would
not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her.<eos>: 34.26593679869036
Though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced.<eos>: 61.907638406787775
He has
children of his own, and may have more.<eos>: 42.093323646638936
How could he spare half ten
thousand pounds?"

"If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been," said
Elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
exactly know what Mr.<eos>: 41.14767264722652
Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has
not sixpence of his own.<eos>: 31.061558447554415
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be
requited.<eos>: 22.716840378276178
Their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.<eos>: 122.12810171493699
By this time she is
actually with them!<eos>: 58.747621976036385
If such goodness does not make her miserable now,
she will never deserve to be happy!<eos>: 51.719532513763845
What a meeting for her, when she
first sees my aunt!"

"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said
Jane: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy.<eos>: 49.18220271671711
His consenting to marry
her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking.<eos>: 48.55879192980264
Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten."

"Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor
I, nor any body, can ever forget.<eos>: 109.29910147771722
It is useless to talk of it."

It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened.<eos>: 62.726818175237305
They went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to
make it known to her.<eos>: 29.17861454693004
He was writing, and, without raising his head,
coolly replied,

"Just as you please."

"May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"

"Take whatever you like, and get away."

Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up
stairs together.<eos>: 52.99817575888909
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs.<eos>: 42.91481723115782
Bennet: one
communication would, therefore, do for all.<eos>: 86.90347097362866
After a slight preparation
for good news, the letter was read aloud.<eos>: 48.967581906332846
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet could hardly
contain herself.<eos>: 33.27518646833288
As soon as Jane had read Mr.<eos>: 25.57803498739036
Gardiner's hope of Lydia's
being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence
added to its exuberance.<eos>: 38.55214732124877
She was now in an irritation as violent from
delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation.<eos>: 34.58501877914047
To know
that her daughter would be married was enough.<eos>: 29.404761686719294
She was disturbed by no
fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.

"My dear, dear Lydia!" she cried: "This is delightful indeed!--She will
be married!--I shall see her again!--She will be married at sixteen!--My
good, kind brother!--I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage
every thing.<eos>: 43.38734278490542
How I long to see her!<eos>: 35.22255256847418
and to see dear Wickham too!<eos>: 169.87691385141804
But the
clothes, the wedding clothes!<eos>: 61.10645411989899
I will write to my sister Gardiner about
them directly.<eos>: 42.84786161298719
Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how
much he will give her.<eos>: 34.457147095920455
Stay, stay, I will go myself.<eos>: 34.62088957665577
Ring the bell,
Kitty, for Hill.<eos>: 44.6543092847026
I will put on my things in a moment.<eos>: 43.270171195926174
My dear, dear
Lydia!--How merry we shall be together when we meet!"

Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.
Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.

"For we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great
measure, to his kindness.<eos>: 53.19853997707455
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself
to assist Mr.<eos>: 23.318438086846317
Wickham with money."

"Well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but
her own uncle?<eos>: 28.192693369627523
If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children
must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have
ever had any thing from him, except a few presents.<eos>: 49.22932916984511
Well!<eos>: 8.075810434169812
I am so happy.
In a short time, I shall have a daughter married.<eos>: 25.231479603200025
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Wickham!<eos>: 5.617151438721931
How well
it sounds.<eos>: 23.800563226201582
And she was only sixteen last June.<eos>: 45.140933246454786
My dear Jane, I am in
such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you
write for me.<eos>: 26.915763667391452
We will settle with your father about the money
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."

She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her
father was at leisure to be consulted.<eos>: 50.284797975214204
One day's delay she observed,
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite
so obstinate as usual.<eos>: 37.61446201417495
Other schemes too came into her head.

"I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister Philips.<eos>: 39.14110821049531
And as I come back, I can call on
Lady Lucas and Mrs.<eos>: 43.77876605071112
Long.<eos>: 6.874287073031545
Kitty, run down and order the carriage.<eos>: 59.44091963900467
An
airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure.<eos>: 21.968645322644115
Girls, can I do any
thing for you in Meryton?<eos>: 34.1648571796608
Oh!<eos>: 4.7344512948191735
here comes Hill.<eos>: 50.967501387087665
My dear Hill, have you
heard the good news?<eos>: 65.5287669430587
Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall
all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding."

Mrs.<eos>: 28.056965818385805
Hill began instantly to express her joy.<eos>: 44.435154814938464
Elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.

Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no
worse, she had need to be thankful.<eos>: 51.06827180839785
She felt it so; and though, in
looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,
could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they
had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they
had gained.




CHAPTER VIII.


Mr.<eos>: 47.56227667026639
Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for
the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
him.<eos>: 40.12056331835436
He now wished it more than ever.<eos>: 35.43153948972781
Had he done his duty in that
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of
honour or credit could now be purchased for her.<eos>: 52.72921853023826
The satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be
her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.

He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any
one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and
he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his
assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.

When first Mr.<eos>: 47.52057622570602
Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
useless; for, of course, they were to have a son.<eos>: 51.277092377979486
This son was to join
in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for.<eos>: 68.17165540340937
Five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.
Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he
would.<eos>: 36.85921545375383
This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
late to be saving.<eos>: 50.48271750628978
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet had no turn for economy, and her
husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income.

Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.<eos>: 86.76956825102074
Bennet and
the children.<eos>: 19.277566372107827
But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter, depended on the will of the parents.<eos>: 44.45637781090747
This was one point, with
regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr.<eos>: 30.830226017495708
Bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.<eos>: 21.639469069390383
In
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though
expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him.<eos>: 48.75255452965773
He had never before supposed
that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be
done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present
arrangement.<eos>: 60.44127137734504
He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her,
through her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within
that sum.

That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to
have as little trouble in the business as possible.<eos>: 59.27488381685944
When the first
transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were
over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.<eos>: 38.347329630688925
His letter was
soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was
quick in its execution.<eos>: 31.83680368399339
He begged to know farther particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any
message to her.

The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood.<eos>: 42.417057413558204
It was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy.<eos>: 42.03064459434841
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of
conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm
house.<eos>: 49.12377330213609
But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the
good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from
all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her
misery was considered certain.

It was a fortnight since Mrs.<eos>: 78.11670933892894
Bennet had been down stairs, but on this
happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high.<eos>: 47.239973100667235
No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph.<eos>: 46.916152011431926
The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants.<eos>: 46.897425117756036
She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.

"Haye-Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings would quit it, or the
great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is
too far off!<eos>: 54.32497922599781
I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."

Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the
servants remained.<eos>: 64.13635276970865
But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "Mrs.
Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding.<eos>: 42.42601076360953
Into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance.<eos>: 36.84574652313824
I will not encourage
the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn."

A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr.<eos>: 39.56109348157454
Bennet was firm: it
soon led to another; and Mrs.<eos>: 34.2289801804504
Bennet found, with amazement and horror,
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter.<eos>: 32.3112545394921
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever, on the occasion.<eos>: 50.58970599405148
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet could hardly comprehend
it.<eos>: 17.549540518223107
That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe
possible.<eos>: 58.74228993412504
She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they
took place.

Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make Mr.<eos>: 46.09854977955997
Darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper
termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the
spot.

She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means.<eos>: 70.87644509087939
There were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's
frailty would have mortified her so much.<eos>: 45.24336605937623
Not, however, from any fear of
disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there
seemed a gulf impassable between them.<eos>: 36.0073654472184
Had Lydia's marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
Mr.<eos>: 35.16516277295412
Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other
objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.

From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.<eos>: 52.30377053130801
The
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this.<eos>: 51.286660514785204
She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
hardly knew of what.<eos>: 34.17690011979834
She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it.<eos>: 21.764267413531922
She wanted to hear of him, when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.<eos>: 32.2373591102068
She was convinced that
she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they
should meet.

What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now
have been gladly and gratefully received!<eos>: 52.94749034238924
He was as generous, she
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex.<eos>: 51.35748922424571
But while he was mortal,
there must be a triumph.

She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her.<eos>: 58.99689110955086
His understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.<eos>: 38.16330881360791
It
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved,
and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must
have received benefit of greater importance.

But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was.<eos>: 59.62857466983393
An union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
family.

How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,
she could not imagine.<eos>: 28.42897715895882
But how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.

       *       *       *       *       *

Mr.<eos>: 78.1651700611349
Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.<eos>: 36.954921255463624
To Mr.<eos>: 3.41905689985544
Bennet's
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.<eos>: 33.318715818827485
The principal
purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr.<eos>: 19.897516550190694
Wickham had resolved
on quitting the Militia.

     "It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon
     as his marriage was fixed on.<eos>: 47.15153335051688
And I think you will agree with me,
     in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both
     on his account and my niece's.<eos>: 80.82865085918291
It is Mr.<eos>: 8.675459021808681
Wickham's intention to go
     into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still
     some who are able and willing to assist him in the army.<eos>: 43.96926473851927
He has the
     promise of an ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in
     the North.<eos>: 50.37699325694442
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of
     the kingdom.<eos>: 25.93653800050097
He promises fairly, and I hope among different people,
     where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be
     more prudent.<eos>: 60.80910998174231
I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of
     our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the
     various creditors of Mr.<eos>: 30.553677636658755
Wickham in and near Brighton, with
     assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself.<eos>: 40.59232642127625
And
     will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances
     to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list,
     according to his information.<eos>: 44.58933014779893
He has given in all his debts; I hope
     at least he has not deceived us.<eos>: 48.85225654844102
Haggerston has our directions, and
     all will be completed in a week.<eos>: 41.09274550982796
They will then join his regiment,
     unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from
     Mrs.<eos>: 51.76915057910848
Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all,
     before she leaves the South.<eos>: 24.787621562555316
She is well, and begs to be dutifully
     remembered to you and her mother.--Your's, &c.

     "E.<eos>: 37.4193711355182
GARDINER."

Mr.<eos>: 6.614795810514142
Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal
from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr.<eos>: 26.98294171081083
Gardiner could do.<eos>: 19.313202270956584
But Mrs.
Bennet, was not so well pleased with it.<eos>: 18.90368587897664
Lydia's being settled in the
North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her
company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a
pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with every body, and had so many favourites.

"She is so fond of Mrs.<eos>: 46.025218253621844
Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking
to send her away!<eos>: 30.91182063946812
And there are several of the young men, too, that she
likes very much.<eos>: 39.99000287585256
The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----'s
regiment."

His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her family again, before she set off for the North,
received at first an absolute negative.<eos>: 63.33907429500609
But Jane and Elizabeth, who
agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.<eos>: 38.197260084673026
And their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew
her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
the North.<eos>: 29.134870695368296
When Mr.<eos>: 2.820923248578635
Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he
sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon
as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn.<eos>: 41.15596490317353
Elizabeth
was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme,
and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him
would have been the last object of her wishes.




CHAPTER IX.


Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself.<eos>: 42.08030234642437
The carriage was sent to meet
them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time.<eos>: 56.44865925640549
Their
arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets; and Jane more especially,
who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_
been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must
endure.

They came.<eos>: 87.38474902361021
The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive
them.<eos>: 29.74634472202469
Smiles decked the face of Mrs.<eos>: 12.718542377545829
Bennet, as the carriage drove up to
the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.

Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
she ran into the room.<eos>: 47.090337799428184
Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to
Wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.

Their reception from Mr.<eos>: 61.22463866288409
Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial.<eos>: 26.957490550013567
His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
opened his lips.<eos>: 55.25809436914768
The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
enough to provoke him.<eos>: 32.86358546491411
Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was
shocked.<eos>: 20.040509227386643
Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and
fearless.<eos>: 33.30385406629413
She turned from sister to sister, demanding their
congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
there.

Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners
were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.<eos>: 69.8534014115548
Elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,
resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man.<eos>: 53.3714214855204
_She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of
the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.

There was no want of discourse.<eos>: 45.973397515121924
The bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near
Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies.<eos>: 81.48393263097329
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world.<eos>: 28.615622818969353
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led
voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world.

"Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I went away;
it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time.<eos>: 74.13605053636773
Good gracious!<eos>: 18.59246689601378
when I went away, I am sure
I had no more idea of being married till I came back again!<eos>: 26.34165760930225
though I
thought it would be very good fun if I was."

Her father lifted up his eyes.<eos>: 43.33299324409185
Jane was distressed.<eos>: 19.150639716029072
Elizabeth looked
expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "Oh!<eos>: 34.46672012516527
mamma, do the
people here abouts know I am married to-day?<eos>: 112.77439646192752
I was afraid they might
not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was
determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to
him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window
frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like
any thing."

Elizabeth could bear it no longer.<eos>: 76.19120759529048
She got up, and ran out of the room;
and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining-parlour.<eos>: 31.77694963374422
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to
her eldest sister, "Ah!<eos>: 50.88264595532692
Jane, I take your place now, and you must go
lower, because I am a married woman."

It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment,
from which she had been so wholly free at first.<eos>: 49.75707188840541
Her ease and good
spirits increased.<eos>: 70.24909457706097
She longed to see Mrs.<eos>: 14.035890252990285
Philips, the Lucases, and all
their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs.<eos>: 52.58852926362135
Wickham," by
each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her
ring and boast of being married, to Mrs.<eos>: 60.32400159545634
Hill and the two housemaids.

"Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
room, "and what do you think of my husband?<eos>: 22.533408311363104
Is not he a charming man?<eos>: 62.54063183591191
I
am sure my sisters must all envy me.<eos>: 23.62785466154467
I only hope they may have half my
good luck.<eos>: 39.37976187100402
They must all go to Brighton.<eos>: 18.50116688729822
That is the place to get
husbands.<eos>: 19.446255769366694
What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."

"Very true; and if I had my will, we should.<eos>: 41.44747215644389
But my dear Lydia, I don't
at all like your going such a way off.<eos>: 63.3071761868474
Must it be so?"

"Oh, lord!<eos>: 19.327223505550993
yes;--there is nothing in that.<eos>: 29.82132130030649
I shall like it of all
things.<eos>: 27.811642052888274
You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.<eos>: 47.54533168030843
We
shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some
balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all."

"I should like it beyond any thing!" said her mother.

"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over."

"I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands."

Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.<eos>: 41.767641662738896
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Wickham
had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.

No one but Mrs.<eos>: 46.34115059652781
Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and
she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home.<eos>: 49.493812767404144
These parties were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think, than such as did not.

Wickham's affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to
find it; not equal to Lydia's for him.<eos>: 88.31807679556971
She had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion.

Lydia was exceedingly fond of him.<eos>: 53.85523364112555
He was her dear Wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.<eos>: 70.5685466803114
He did every
thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of September, than any body else in the country.

One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,

"Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe.<eos>: 39.03414182793592
You were
not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it.<eos>: 48.82150268638969
Are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?"

"No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too little said
on the subject."

"La!<eos>: 34.61046624733745
You are so strange!<eos>: 23.5705689172128
But I must tell you how it went off.<eos>: 32.02756815886591
We were
married, you know, at St.<eos>: 21.052601095653195
Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in
that parish.<eos>: 45.28909863920326
And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o'clock.<eos>: 43.16321460523234
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others
were to meet us at the church.<eos>: 36.77389354866509
Well, Monday morning came, and I was in
such a fuss!<eos>: 54.89441740305465
I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put
it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.<eos>: 41.20313427108796
And there was my
aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if
she was reading a sermon.<eos>: 73.27044420779485
However, I did not hear above one word in ten,
for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham.<eos>: 41.69218893636234
I longed to
know whether he would be married in his blue coat.

"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never
be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them.<eos>: 45.82544407303997
If you'll believe
me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a
fortnight.<eos>: 46.03282530186803
Not one party, or scheme, or any thing.<eos>: 32.29235735081017
To be sure London was
rather thin, but however the little Theatre was open.<eos>: 81.17467414863424
Well, and so just
as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business
to that horrid man Mr.<eos>: 61.36022402473641
Stone.<eos>: 4.284598229310799
And then, you know, when once they get
together, there is no end of it.<eos>: 36.13766574479789
Well, I was so frightened I did not
know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond
the hour, we could not be married all day.<eos>: 42.490140736802125
But, luckily, he came back
again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.<eos>: 44.52850089679085
However, I
recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the
wedding need not be put off, for Mr.<eos>: 61.678469111029315
Darcy might have done as well."

"Mr.<eos>: 16.770666463271986
Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.

"Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know.<eos>: 35.3026227556171
But gracious me!
I quite forgot!<eos>: 162.68509054874428
I ought not to have said a word about it.<eos>: 31.425805049756516
I promised
them so faithfully!<eos>: 24.55366625872603
What will Wickham say?<eos>: 54.166272495868064
It was to be such a secret!"

"If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the
subject.<eos>: 30.049096389629465
You may depend upon my seeking no further."

"Oh!<eos>: 24.68801314959665
certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will
ask you no questions."

"Thank you," said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly tell you
all, and then Wickham would be angry."

On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away.

But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it
was impossible not to try for information.<eos>: 48.468154286834164
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy had been at her
sister's wedding.<eos>: 16.739721689307114
It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
brain; but she was satisfied with none.<eos>: 48.08480453784744
Those that best pleased her, as
placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.<eos>: 75.96840431098201
She
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended.

"You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to
know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively
speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
a time.<eos>: 57.679622793035676
Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to
think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance."

"Not that I _shall_ though," she added to herself, as she finished the
letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out."

Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of
it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.




CHAPTER X.


Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as
soon as she possibly could.<eos>: 54.72701962272456
She was no sooner in possession of it, than
hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be
interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be
happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial.

     "Gracechurch-street, Sept.<eos>: 36.61624290763531
6.

     "MY DEAR NIECE,

     "I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole
     morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will
     not comprise what I have to tell you.<eos>: 31.249455866870356
I must confess myself
     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.
     Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,
     that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_
     side.<eos>: 56.87883641231963
If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my
     impertinence.<eos>: 29.00158873257831
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing
     but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed
     him to act as he has done.<eos>: 54.230037750207984
But if you are really innocent and
     ignorant, I must be more explicit.<eos>: 20.62304365568302
On the very day of my coming
     home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.<eos>: 47.40944354398921
Mr.
     Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.<eos>: 34.808182845303655
It was all
     over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked
     as _your's_ seems to have been.<eos>: 85.61597334077966
He came to tell Mr.<eos>: 14.625914360224309
Gardiner that
     he had found out where your sister and Mr.<eos>: 33.09132530784441
Wickham were, and that
     he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia
     once.<eos>: 79.58152823565108
From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day
     after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting
     for them.<eos>: 53.17598997125642
The motive professed, was his conviction of its being
     owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well
     known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,
     to love or confide in him.<eos>: 46.072779045383285
He generously imputed the whole to his
     mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath
     him, to lay his private actions open to the world.<eos>: 56.324689924002776
His character
     was to speak for itself.<eos>: 28.31572413881428
He called it, therefore, his duty to step
     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on
     by himself.<eos>: 37.17634031032571
If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never
     disgrace him.<eos>: 23.562691000213874
He had been some days in town, before he was able to
     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was
     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another
     reason for his resolving to follow us.<eos>: 36.63002659917346
There is a lady, it seems, a
     Mrs.<eos>: 34.09092016529809
Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was
     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though
     he did not say what.<eos>: 48.87612647860313
She then took a large house in Edward-street,
     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.<eos>: 69.05855329077708
This Mrs.
     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he
     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town.<eos>: 36.429503838029696
But
     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
     wanted.<eos>: 60.65360168918951
She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery
     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be
     found.<eos>: 42.10113847717765
Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in
     London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they
     would have taken up their abode with her.<eos>: 33.9448439794618
At length, however, our
     kind friend procured the wished-for direction.<eos>: 65.84213428603633
They were in ----
     street.<eos>: 38.185278439271755
He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.
     His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade
     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her
     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,
     offering his assistance, as far as it would go.<eos>: 47.716653361891275
But he found Lydia
     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.<eos>: 117.95173980723558
She cared for none
     of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of
     leaving Wickham.<eos>: 41.80447070629266
She was sure they should be married some time or
     other, and it did not much signify when.<eos>: 50.24233697563278
Since such were her
     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a
     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he
     easily learnt, had never been _his_ design.<eos>: 82.77404350492449
He confessed himself
     obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,
     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the
     ill-consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone.<eos>: 46.143817747649976
He
     meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future
     situation, he could conjecture very little about it.<eos>: 45.79552662836672
He must go
     somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have
     nothing to live on.<eos>: 37.83103341664048
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy asked him why he had not married your
     sister at once.<eos>: 54.573387612405384
Though Mr.<eos>: 3.3667553341620535
Bennet was not imagined to be very rich,
     he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation
     must have been benefited by marriage.<eos>: 31.91909335357804
But he found, in reply to
     this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more
     effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.
     Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof
     against the temptation of immediate relief.<eos>: 61.19579881988081
They met several times,
     for there was much to be discussed.<eos>: 23.40854844808486
Wickham of course wanted more
     than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.
     Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr.<eos>: 56.67385915995638
Darcy's next step was
     to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in
     Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home.<eos>: 63.68083664427095
But Mr.<eos>: 3.76683742908994
Gardiner
     could not be seen, and Mr.<eos>: 12.058675218948428
Darcy found, on further enquiry, that
     your father was still with him, but would quit town the next
     morning.<eos>: 47.02098372261779
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could
     so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed
     seeing him, till after the departure of the former.<eos>: 57.78212129975307
He did not
     leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a
     gentleman had called on business.<eos>: 37.91771492178297
On Saturday he came again.<eos>: 33.74203307615137
Your
     father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they
     had a great deal of talk together.<eos>: 41.76664922146763
They met again on Sunday, and
     then _I_ saw him too.<eos>: 53.29248554744009
It was not all settled before Monday: as soon
     as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn.<eos>: 56.84377722906144
But our visitor
     was very obstinate.<eos>: 24.660225499710105
I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real
     defect of his character after all.<eos>: 40.659532445372434
He has been accused of many
     faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one.<eos>: 59.97280407155757
Nothing was
     to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do
     not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your
     uncle would most readily have settled the whole.<eos>: 54.22031816511274
They battled it
     together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman
     or lady concerned in it deserved.<eos>: 67.2835106416206
But at last your uncle was forced
     to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,
     was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,
     which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your
     letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an
     explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give
     the praise where it was due.<eos>: 67.38184112623543
But, Lizzy, this must go no farther
     than yourself, or Jane at most.<eos>: 60.72526423361225
You know pretty well, I suppose,
     what has been done for the young people.<eos>: 34.42149061506969
His debts are to be paid,
     amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,
     another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his
     commission purchased.<eos>: 51.46799389059593
The reason why all this was to be done by him
     alone, was such as I have given above.<eos>: 65.40262309459038
It was owing to him, to his
     reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character
     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been
     received and noticed as he was.<eos>: 30.030827022750646
Perhaps there was some truth in
     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_
     reserve, can be answerable for the event.<eos>: 69.22616352472994
But in spite of all this
     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that
     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit
     for _another interest_ in the affair.<eos>: 54.49845863876823
When all this was resolved
     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at
     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more
     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to
     receive the last finish.<eos>: 59.88817553750632
I believe I have now told you every thing.
     It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I
     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.<eos>: 46.848252196145275
Lydia came to
     us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house.<eos>: 27.946850986107584
_He_ was
     exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I
     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour
     while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter
     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a
     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no
     fresh pain.<eos>: 66.75041063025795
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,
     representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and
     all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.<eos>: 28.258067015930934
If she heard me,
     it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen.<eos>: 21.235329654164435
I was
     sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth
     and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.<eos>: 44.10334701960773
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy was
     punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the
     wedding.<eos>: 40.44145103232036
He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again
     on Wednesday or Thursday.<eos>: 45.16911044417777
Will you be very angry with me, my dear
     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold
     enough to say before) how much I like him.<eos>: 43.00057590795616
His behaviour to us has,
     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.
     His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but
     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his
     wife may teach him.<eos>: 92.21702859185086
I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever
     mentioned your name.<eos>: 53.0497579587706
But slyness seems the fashion.<eos>: 42.756068889532784
Pray forgive
     me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so
     far, as to exclude me from P.<eos>: 23.81134391654127
I shall never be quite happy till I
     have been all round the park.<eos>: 32.20677358586868
A low phaeton, with a nice little
     pair of ponies, would be the very thing.<eos>: 32.68026676744422
But I must write no more.
     The children have been wanting me this half hour.<eos>: 76.27672592722844
Your's, very
     sincerely,

     "M.<eos>: 43.87661632211646
GARDINER."

The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share.<eos>: 72.21081858221577
The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced of what Mr.<eos>: 20.353153754626053
Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's
match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too
great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the
pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!
He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the
trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,
persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to
avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.<eos>: 70.53849604205958
He had
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.<eos>: 83.76496718929836
Her
heart did whisper, that he had done it for her.<eos>: 33.70648836900802
But it was a hope
shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her
vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for
her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a
sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham.
Brother-in-law of Wickham!<eos>: 111.00789218819331
Every kind of pride must revolt from the
connection.<eos>: 34.742219339697535
He had to be sure done much.<eos>: 50.13676922769425
She was ashamed to think how
much.<eos>: 30.401632749959486
But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no
extraordinary stretch of belief.<eos>: 47.25529303444938
It was reasonable that he should feel
he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising
it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,
she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might
assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be
materially concerned.<eos>: 56.88416854900061
It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that
they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a
return.<eos>: 51.71285151992177
They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing
to him.<eos>: 26.56459809891448
Oh!<eos>: 4.7344512948191735
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation
she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed
towards him.<eos>: 81.2522441521129
For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get
the better of himself.<eos>: 35.33240800887827
She read over her aunt's commendation of him
again and again.<eos>: 34.655418408867604
It was hardly enough; but it pleased her.<eos>: 59.838954281476255
She was even
sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how
steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and
confidence subsisted between Mr.<eos>: 63.15531494667952
Darcy and herself.

She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's
approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was
overtaken by Wickham.

"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said he,
as he joined her.

"You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome."

"I should be sorry indeed, if it were.<eos>: 29.834087527609803
_We_ were always good friends;
and now we are better."

"True.<eos>: 40.1525564456221
Are the others coming out?"

"I do not know.<eos>: 25.075918980771334
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to
Meryton.<eos>: 34.690850805509264
And so, my dear sister, I find from our uncle and aunt, that
you have actually seen Pemberley."

She replied in the affirmative.

"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much
for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.<eos>: 31.706149025089186
And you saw the
old housekeeper, I suppose?<eos>: 50.317721388031735
Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of
me.<eos>: 23.20874861154571
But of course she did not mention my name to you."

"Yes, she did."

"And what did she say?"

"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
out well.<eos>: 41.8443318183611
At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented."

"Certainly," he replied, biting his lips.<eos>: 40.625115797340655
Elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,

"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.<eos>: 37.358769950263984
We passed each other
several times.<eos>: 58.42906161516262
I wonder what he can be doing there."

"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said
Elizabeth.<eos>: 31.18028385281539
"It must be something particular, to take him there at this
time of year."

"Undoubtedly.<eos>: 49.381197704789194
Did you see him while you were at Lambton?<eos>: 35.9816400417845
I thought I
understood from the Gardiners that you had."

"Yes; he introduced us to his sister."

"And do you like her?"

"Very much."

"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two.<eos>: 44.757566254562676
When I last saw her, she was not very promising.<eos>: 18.007984112303333
I am very glad
you liked her.<eos>: 23.91609965396279
I hope she will turn out well."

"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."

"Did you go by the village of Kympton?"

"I do not recollect that we did."

"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had.<eos>: 44.6068078104583
A
most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House!<eos>: 290.5194236440921
It would have suited
me in every respect."

"How should you have liked making sermons?"

"Exceedingly well.<eos>: 47.483311233130394
I should have considered it as part of my duty, and
the exertion would soon have been nothing.<eos>: 33.486253471825975
One ought not to
repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me!<eos>: 29.72130638713149
The
quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas
of happiness!<eos>: 75.46461916783312
But it was not to be.<eos>: 11.759537789009885
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the
circumstance, when you were in Kent?"

"I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."

"You have.<eos>: 56.94034804167496
Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the
first, you may remember."

"I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so
palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly."

"You did!<eos>: 57.040758398378436
and it was not wholly without foundation.<eos>: 48.689742275395815
You may remember
what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it."

They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him,
she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,

"Come, Mr.<eos>: 40.61385056979167
Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.<eos>: 43.737297265170334
Do not let us
quarrel about the past.<eos>: 49.12372836068366
In future, I hope we shall be always of one
mind."

She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.




CHAPTER XI.


Mr.<eos>: 46.14803635210576
Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he
never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,
by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet.

The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs.<eos>: 45.25167218550116
Bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.

"Oh!<eos>: 55.22869255690189
my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"

"Oh, lord!<eos>: 25.949519544262248
I don't know.<eos>: 24.752234767350863
Not these two or three years perhaps."

"Write to me very often, my dear."

"As often as I can.<eos>: 74.28616903651539
But you know married women have never much time for
writing.<eos>: 109.56176495973116
My sisters may write to _me_.<eos>: 29.955312611041748
They will have nothing else to
do."

Mr.<eos>: 19.29315041472583
Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's.<eos>: 25.523838674584823
He
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.

"He is as fine a fellow," said Mr.<eos>: 56.36080244795687
Bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, "as ever I saw.<eos>: 25.635048083750597
He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us
all.<eos>: 30.172433501850293
I am prodigiously proud of him.<eos>: 15.624024858997837
I defy even Sir William Lucas
himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law."

The loss of her daughter made Mrs.<eos>: 73.42198287518914
Bennet very dull for several days.

"I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with
one's friends.<eos>: 27.951700902550215
One seems so forlorn without them."

"This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said
Elizabeth.<eos>: 50.12700097226873
"It must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single."

"It is no such thing.<eos>: 52.874431816994154
Lydia does not leave me because she is married;
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off.<eos>: 40.96234363619791
If
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."

But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was
shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by
an article of news, which then began to be in circulation.<eos>: 52.79844535933752
The
housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the
arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot
there for several weeks.<eos>: 46.43181788977271
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet was quite in the fidgets.<eos>: 13.16606177172822
She
looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.

"Well, well, and so Mr.<eos>: 23.85617092768937
Bingley is coming down, sister," (for Mrs.
Philips first brought her the news.) "Well, so much the better.<eos>: 109.51129395667957
Not that
I care about it, though.<eos>: 47.60147647163581
He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure
_I_ never want to see him again.<eos>: 27.933585522378586
But, however, he is very welcome to
come to Netherfield, if he likes it.<eos>: 23.991452194488293
And who knows what _may_ happen?
But that is nothing to us.<eos>: 78.93130815190767
You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it.<eos>: 89.65013425957771
And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"

"You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs.<eos>: 41.035688097336816
Nicholls was in
Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.<eos>: 66.21242299368225
He
comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday.<eos>: 43.34553756451864
She was
going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be
killed."

Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing
colour.<eos>: 38.8048360189561
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to
Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,

"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report; and I know I appeared distressed.<eos>: 41.711608659354
But don't imagine it was from
any silly cause.<eos>: 55.450468628073295
I was only confused for the moment, because I felt
that I _should_ be looked at.<eos>: 36.397628760564245
I do assure you, that the news does not
affect me either with pleasure or pain.<eos>: 46.358327224749054
I am glad of one thing, that he
comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.<eos>: 41.95671546254398
Not that I am afraid
of _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks."

Elizabeth did not know what to make of it.<eos>: 32.10308679883003
Had she not seen him in
Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come
without it.

"Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come
to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this
speculation!<eos>: 52.0530991820404
I _will_ leave him to himself."

In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it.<eos>: 37.94197167224895
They were more disturbed,
more unequal, than she had often seen them.

The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.

"As soon as ever Mr.<eos>: 40.75785336028106
Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs.<eos>: 14.371411654838573
Bennet, "you
will wait on him of course."

"No, no.<eos>: 28.125134390560547
You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.<eos>: 73.18863389765004
But it ended in
nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again."

His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
Netherfield.

"'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he.<eos>: 48.191400356641644
"If he wants our society, let
him seek it.<eos>: 59.932918950541556
He knows where we live.<eos>: 72.37239407506269
I will not spend _my_ hours in
running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back
again."

"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not
wait on him.<eos>: 52.049822091320166
But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine
here, I am determined.<eos>: 35.84985516280958
We must have Mrs.<eos>: 12.689266314320838
Long and the Gouldings soon.
That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at
table for him."

Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see Mr.<eos>: 56.90073293439341
Bingley in consequence of it, before _they_
did.<eos>: 39.99497154895208
As the day of his arrival drew near,

"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her sister.<eos>: 32.07395397221176
"It
would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.<eos>: 47.03967176207663
My mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can know how much I suffer from what she
says.<eos>: 70.58748586534188
Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!"

"I wish I could say any thing to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but
it is wholly out of my power.<eos>: 36.81741824811726
You must feel it; and the usual
satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because
you have always so much."

Mr.<eos>: 46.84544825062327
Bingley arrived.<eos>: 8.900811961582642
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could.<eos>: 30.855322139393554
She counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;
hopeless of seeing him before.<eos>: 80.32495406719312
But on the third morning after his
arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window,
enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.

Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.<eos>: 41.24067169020927
Jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr.<eos>: 41.78531867584856
Darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister.

"There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be?"

"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
know."

"La!" replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before.<eos>: 35.687817172579514
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
what's his name.<eos>: 50.969999817130336
That tall, proud man."

"Good gracious!<eos>: 57.19321978542966
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy!--and so it does I vow.<eos>: 39.23356883593183
Well, any friend of
Mr.<eos>: 23.012718364266895
Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must
say that I hate the very sight of him."

Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.<eos>: 47.8105507931074
She knew but little
of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter.<eos>: 50.140804157586366
Both sisters were uncomfortable
enough.<eos>: 39.9600352078106
Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr.<eos>: 39.149498749384094
Darcy, and her resolution to be
civil to him only as Mr.<eos>: 26.476727240972004
Bingley's friend, without being heard by either
of them.<eos>: 22.558748346918374
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.
Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and
whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as
what Jane felt for Bingley.<eos>: 55.259134949320476
Her astonishment at his coming--at his
coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in Derbyshire.

The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a
minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken.<eos>: 68.2009874176928
But she would not be secure.

"Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early
enough for expectation."

She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her
sister, as the servant was approaching the door.<eos>: 41.52416893021485
Jane looked a little
paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected.<eos>: 23.84156475099573
On the
gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.

Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.<eos>: 70.14157695597505
She
had ventured only one glance at Darcy.<eos>: 98.08989289368807
He looked serious as usual; and
she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as
she had seen him at Pemberley.<eos>: 27.643992422801173
But, perhaps he could not in her mother's
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.<eos>: 42.501351336960724
It was a painful, but
not an improbable, conjecture.

Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.<eos>: 103.09531610404126
He was received by Mrs.
Bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed,
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her curtsey and address to his friend.

Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was
hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied.

Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr.<eos>: 65.73819214727219
and Mrs.<eos>: 3.8891635654619057
Gardiner did, a question
which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.
He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence;
but it had not been so in Derbyshire.<eos>: 44.719085614662696
There he had talked to her
friends, when he could not to herself.<eos>: 22.366133311047705
But now several minutes elapsed,
without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable
to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she
as often found him looking at Jane, as at herself, and frequently on no
object but the ground.<eos>: 56.76933168189445
More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please
than when they last met, were plainly expressed.<eos>: 71.13567780802204
She was disappointed,
and angry with herself for being so.

"Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said she.<eos>: 40.178547390279384
"Yet why did he come?"

She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to
him she had hardly courage to speak.

She enquired after his sister, but could do no more.

"It is a long time, Mr.<eos>: 48.08581332840905
Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs.<eos>: 14.231145026079897
Bennet.

He readily agreed to it.

"I began to be afraid you would never come back again.<eos>: 32.00173257099541
People _did_ say,
you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope
it is not true.<eos>: 29.063540880540458
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,
since you went away.<eos>: 54.43665372918281
Miss Lucas is married and settled.<eos>: 31.993636115238235
And one of my
own daughters.<eos>: 22.259404789546693
I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it in the papers.<eos>: 18.651765595969295
It was in the Times and the Courier, I know;
though it was not put in as it ought to be.<eos>: 34.14686484438674
It was only said, 'Lately,
George Wickham, Esq.<eos>: 61.274762883923714
to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a
syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.
It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to
make such an awkward business of it.<eos>: 68.96963711930992
Did you see it?"

Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.<eos>: 42.70747173477217
Elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes.<eos>: 15.962307907655932
How Mr.<eos>: 3.007391752405174
Darcy looked, therefore, she could
not tell.

"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,"
continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr.<eos>: 23.09564724158376
Bingley, it is very
hard to have her taken such a way from me.<eos>: 28.614638202565445
They are gone down to
Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to
stay, I do not know how long.<eos>: 38.290725889270924
His regiment is there; for I suppose you
have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the
regulars.<eos>: 31.319891616990255
Thank Heaven!<eos>: 14.495698740840888
he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
many as he deserves."

Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr.<eos>: 35.99002744001251
Darcy, was in such misery
of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.<eos>: 29.940228842162277
It drew from her,
however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually
done before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in
the country at present.<eos>: 42.22686379318249
A few weeks, he believed.

"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr.<eos>: 22.629411196605837
Bingley," said her mother,
"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr.
Bennet's manor.<eos>: 15.797134573919635
I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the covies for you."

Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention!<eos>: 32.673019527508195
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.<eos>: 44.44438816980097
At that instant she felt,
that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for
moments of such painful confusion.

"The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be
in company with either of them.<eos>: 64.41598030478154
Their society can afford no pleasure,
that will atone for such wretchedness as this!<eos>: 65.85025595636388
Let me never see either
one or the other again!"

Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover.<eos>: 123.26811428432492
When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.<eos>: 52.64005327771498
He
found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as
unaffected, though not quite so chatty.<eos>: 56.75514649030235
Jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever.<eos>: 56.1441836274337
But her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did not always know when she was silent.

When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs.<eos>: 29.377047551310035
Bennet was mindful of her
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
Longbourn in a few days time.

"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr.<eos>: 36.955721797899876
Bingley," she added, "for when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us, as soon as you returned.<eos>: 36.28052113336164
I have not forgot, you see; and I assure
you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement."

Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his concern, at having been prevented by business.<eos>: 45.457504071363
They then went away.

Mrs.<eos>: 13.40939259929675
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a
man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and
pride of one who had ten thousand a-year.




CHAPTER XII.


As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more.<eos>: 55.53320397235029
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.

"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she,
"did he come at all?"

She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.

"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when
he was in town; and why not to me?<eos>: 49.13092483887318
If he fears me, why come hither?<eos>: 65.96335493102683
If
he no longer cares for me, why silent?<eos>: 80.8853909625895
Teazing, teazing, man!<eos>: 91.31793536887606
I will
think no more about him."

Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her
better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.

"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
easy.<eos>: 50.31031316580618
I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming.<eos>: 31.31768411668471
I am glad he dines here on Tuesday.<eos>: 37.582980224997044
It will then be publicly
seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance."

"Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly.<eos>: 54.58364159686261
"Oh, Jane,
take care."

"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now."

"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever."

       *       *       *       *       *

They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs.<eos>: 38.48293212407162
Bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good
humour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had
revived.

On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two,
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as
sportsmen, were in very good time.<eos>: 39.739520840022934
When they repaired to the
dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister.<eos>: 31.84201123850673
Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to
invite him to sit by herself.<eos>: 39.77703005308129
On entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
decided.<eos>: 52.73524749835142
He placed himself by her.

Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.<eos>: 25.934415968943483
He
bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that
Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards Mr.<eos>: 45.640823873687076
Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
alarm.

His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured.<eos>: 70.97105538636745
Though she dared not depend upon the
consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.<eos>: 73.13066129860651
It
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour.<eos>: 37.646580598756145
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table
could divide them.<eos>: 37.70020749455907
He was on one side of her mother.<eos>: 20.50382644503946
She knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
advantage.<eos>: 92.25098608672795
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner, whenever they did.<eos>: 69.59618129819847
Her mother's ungraciousness,
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;
and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell
him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
the family.

She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.<eos>: 43.53482133557815
Anxious and
uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the
gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her
uncivil.<eos>: 38.408722241953264
She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.

"If he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "I shall give him up for
ever."

The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes; but, alas!<eos>: 40.32751509628961
the ladies had crowded round the table,
where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her,
which would admit of a chair.<eos>: 47.76681057990892
And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,

"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined.<eos>: 53.98510638887007
We want none of them;
do we?"

Darcy had walked away to another part of the room.<eos>: 73.0023578475914
She followed him with
her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience
enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself
for being so silly!

"A man who has once been refused!<eos>: 66.3227616423246
How could I ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love?<eos>: 55.99393446394862
Is there one among the sex, who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"

She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup
himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,

"Is your sister at Pemberley still?"

"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."

"And quite alone?<eos>: 60.18973920221175
Have all her friends left her?"

"Mrs.<eos>: 22.099296351933358
Annesley is with her.<eos>: 23.19780336754478
The others have been gone on to Scarborough,
these three weeks."

She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success.<eos>: 44.52364744762827
He stood by her, however, for
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering
to Elizabeth again, he walked away.

When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies
all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when
all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party.<eos>: 41.21423408330188
She now lost every expectation of pleasure.
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.

Mrs.<eos>: 40.12172287701044
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.

"Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "What
say you to the day?<eos>: 39.20085885598753
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,
I assure you.<eos>: 39.05841300426652
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw.<eos>: 102.80624484338581
The
venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat
a haunch.<eos>: 36.70933445785923
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
Lucas's last week; and even Mr.<eos>: 53.56434046619735
Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French
cooks at least.<eos>: 40.3987247055047
And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater
beauty.<eos>: 29.599775548167496
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not.<eos>: 61.37669137242327
And
what do you think she said besides?<eos>: 39.10690527929042
'Ah!<eos>: 9.909876585017123
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet, we shall have her
at Netherfield at last.' She did indeed.<eos>: 49.76249017167845
I do think Mrs.<eos>: 13.442201483759272
Long is as good
a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,
and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously."

Mrs.<eos>: 94.73352311133849
Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.

"It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth.<eos>: 40.30085320231705
"The
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.<eos>: 36.21352567824924
I hope we
may often meet again."

Elizabeth smiled.

"Lizzy, you must not do so.<eos>: 33.59279650415577
You must not suspect me.<eos>: 11.863791797989903
It mortifies me.<eos>: 11.000085669595473
I
assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.<eos>: 60.10727599491235
I am
perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any
design of engaging my affection.<eos>: 51.618644884862306
It is only that he is blessed with
greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing than any other man."

"You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment."

"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"

"And how impossible in others!"

"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
acknowledge?"

"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.<eos>: 55.225179358197614
We all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.<eos>: 66.36554395314745
Forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your
confidante."




CHAPTER XIII.


A few days after this visit, Mr.<eos>: 37.341799049369456
Bingley called again, and alone.<eos>: 22.333254632163644
His
friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in
ten days time.<eos>: 63.30706298489616
He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits.<eos>: 45.16740195002836
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.

"Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky."

He should be particularly happy at any time, &c.<eos>: 40.48268988760449
&c.; and if she would
give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.

"Can you come to-morrow?"

Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity.

He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them
dressed.<eos>: 50.112545470122924
In ran Mrs.<eos>: 45.89606550427194
Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing
gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,

"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.<eos>: 37.85067929958033
He is come--Mr.<eos>: 27.90728794362355
Bingley is
come.--He is, indeed.<eos>: 45.29900054991587
Make haste, make haste.<eos>: 32.8883118738744
Here, Sarah, come to Miss
Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.<eos>: 71.3021345644808
Never mind Miss
Lizzy's hair."

"We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago."

"Oh!<eos>: 35.33308041461337
hang Kitty!<eos>: 16.033073350586392
what has she to do with it?<eos>: 34.68280709703724
Come be quick, be quick!
where is your sash my dear?"

But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters.

The same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the
evening.<eos>: 73.70383006018496
After tea, Mr.<eos>: 9.965981543937845
Bennet retired to the library, as was his
custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument.<eos>: 26.584989026428698
Two obstacles of the
five being thus removed, Mrs.<eos>: 49.984140848352105
Bennet sat looking and winking at
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them.<eos>: 78.55110554910955
Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma?<eos>: 48.382697786179804
What do
you keep winking at me for?<eos>: 37.6530447287898
What am I to do?"

"Nothing child, nothing.<eos>: 57.700222234742995
I did not wink at you." She then sat still five
minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,

"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room.
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at
such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it.
In a few minutes, Mrs.<eos>: 42.84949230094742
Bennet half opened the door and called out,

"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."

Elizabeth was forced to go.

"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother as
soon as she was in the hall.<eos>: 43.642700772072395
"Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in
my dressing-room."

Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawing-room.

Mrs.<eos>: 37.01086082384466
Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.<eos>: 20.560681418951145
Bingley was every
thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.<eos>: 38.91217433629617
His
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the
mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.

He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went
away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.
Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.

After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.<eos>: 72.78295005384845
Not a word passed
between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr.<eos>: 94.16875308471661
Darcy
returned within the stated time.<eos>: 24.025667691281793
Seriously, however, she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's
concurrence.

Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr.<eos>: 31.767414613693454
Bennet spent the
morning together, as had been agreed on.<eos>: 44.15456848857375
The latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected.<eos>: 64.51181987141808
There was nothing of presumption
or folly in Bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him
into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the
other had ever seen him.<eos>: 39.615808857632324
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
and in the evening Mrs.<eos>: 29.878297531885217
Bennet's invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter.<eos>: 40.55406037605173
Elizabeth, who had a letter
to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.

But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she
saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother
had been too ingenious for her.<eos>: 37.57864197733138
On opening the door, she perceived her
sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of
both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would
have told it all.<eos>: 64.03764651269941
_Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she
thought was still worse.<eos>: 78.29308395703268
Not a syllable was uttered by either; and
Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as
well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
words to her sister, ran out of the room.

Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give
pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.

"'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much.<eos>: 46.38202424917784
I do not deserve it.<eos>: 12.270236527969415
Oh!
why is not every body as happy?"

Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a
delight, which words could but poorly express.<eos>: 72.19696178531301
Every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.<eos>: 53.42964061735405
But she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
said, for the present.

"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried.<eos>: 48.124867612633786
"I would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from any one but myself.<eos>: 92.81520636046896
He is gone to my father already.<eos>: 42.90686908119882
Oh!<eos>: 4.7344512948191735
Lizzy, to
know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family!<eos>: 51.99231158592296
how shall I bear so much happiness!"

She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.

Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation.

"And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious
circumspection!<eos>: 50.91314874189975
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance!<eos>: 18.219810952154056
the
happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"

In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose.

"Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door.

"With my mother up stairs.<eos>: 68.47834401950188
She will be down in a moment I dare say."

He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and
affection of a sister.<eos>: 43.60369761410571
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
delight in the prospect of their relationship.<eos>: 44.27345880364959
They shook hands with
great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen
to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;
and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for
basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of
Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself.

It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever.<eos>: 44.36527267178661
Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
her turn was coming soon.<eos>: 55.19432856940176
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet could not give her consent, or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
Mr.<eos>: 54.22821944779337
Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed
how really happy he was.

Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter and said,

"Jane, I congratulate you.<eos>: 65.63061318301504
You will be a very happy woman."

Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
goodness.

"You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled.<eos>: 36.95978825659565
I have not a doubt of your
doing very well together.<eos>: 31.604808578496957
Your tempers are by no means unlike.<eos>: 26.97298561565769
You are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income."

"I hope not so.<eos>: 59.76144027249432
Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be
unpardonable in _me_."

"Exceed their income!<eos>: 39.260961919212555
My dear Mr.<eos>: 6.659460244440013
Bennet," cried his wife, "what are you
talking of?<eos>: 24.536745941512482
Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely
more." Then addressing her daughter, "Oh!<eos>: 57.13737648052211
my dear, dear Jane, I am so
happy!<eos>: 24.775474324432256
I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night.<eos>: 31.774442020741095
I knew how it
would be.<eos>: 17.341543457826937
I always said it must be so, at last.<eos>: 33.89398369175664
I was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing!<eos>: 31.59259700157841
I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when
he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was
that you should come together.<eos>: 49.822407685292106
Oh!<eos>: 4.7344512948191735
he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!"

Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.<eos>: 75.939021011005
Jane was beyond competition her
favourite child.<eos>: 54.08688229324243
At that moment, she cared for no other.<eos>: 33.22637014907247
Her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense.

Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.

Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought
himself obliged to accept.

Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else;
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those
hours of separation that must sometimes occur.<eos>: 82.39564271599662
In the absence of Jane,
he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of
her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of
relief.

"He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that
he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!<eos>: 48.01567697560817
I had not
believed it possible."

"I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth.<eos>: 30.377511218189866
"But how did he account for
it?"

"It must have been his sister's doing.<eos>: 25.84287329896104
They were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.<eos>: 50.957079359736476
But when they see,
as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we
can never be what we once were to each other."

"That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever
heard you utter.<eos>: 44.098667032566816
Good girl!<eos>: 17.185125420451104
It would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard."

"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,
he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!"

"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
modesty."

This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and
the little value he put on his own good qualities.

Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference
of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving
heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice
her against him.

"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried
Jane.<eos>: 47.22120130981593
"Oh!<eos>: 5.456511083755052
Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all!<eos>: 46.63572511748493
If I could but see _you_ as happy!<eos>: 58.18753241180003
If there _were_ but
such another man for you!"

"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as
you.<eos>: 44.32839072386775
Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your
happiness.<eos>: 47.86482187858157
No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very
good luck, I may meet with another Mr.<eos>: 34.95168755725167
Collins in time."

The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a
secret.<eos>: 58.65166609164411
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs.<eos>: 26.32781593607917
Philips, and
_she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in Meryton.

The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.




CHAPTER XIV.


One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the
lawn.<eos>: 51.31165751759771
It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.<eos>: 46.37031712634735
The horses
were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it, were familiar to them.<eos>: 33.55382008889064
As it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery.<eos>: 38.58467003788376
They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
open, and their visitor entered.<eos>: 58.00842914251776
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh.

They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what Elizabeth felt.

She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to Elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the
head, and sat down without saying a word.<eos>: 43.87434212784313
Elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made.

Mrs.<eos>: 29.31492587646757
Bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.<eos>: 69.4580827048548
After sitting
for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,

"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.<eos>: 22.843237923483265
That lady I suppose is your mother."

Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.

"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters."

"Yes, madam," said Mrs.<eos>: 24.346515689922587
Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine.
"She is my youngest girl but one.<eos>: 41.43673918514372
My youngest of all, is lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man,
who I believe will soon become a part of the family."

"You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short
silence.

"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I
assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's."

"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in
summer; the windows are full west."

Mrs.<eos>: 48.597018644191444
Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then
added,

"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr.<eos>: 55.2933429267519
and
Mrs.<eos>: 3.8891635654619057
Collins well."

"Yes, very well.<eos>: 16.988468899562186
I saw them the night before last."

Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.<eos>: 62.579454626844395
But no
letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.

Mrs.<eos>: 22.685311790358273
Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,

"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn.<eos>: 40.966496910327315
I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
will favour me with your company."

"Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the
different walks.<eos>: 29.83709223234134
I think she will be pleased with the hermitage."

Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,
attended her noble guest down stairs.<eos>: 34.57730863830777
As they passed through the hall,
Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent
looking rooms, walked on.

Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it.<eos>: 43.053422594924676
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable.

"How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in
her face.

As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
manner:--

"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither.<eos>: 48.194799813242874
Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I
come."

Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.

"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.<eos>: 48.79125332097962
I have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here."

"Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to
know, that I am not to be trifled with.<eos>: 24.71577037325686
But however insincere _you_ may
choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so.<eos>: 73.27145110097725
My character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it.<eos>: 27.101858600573888
A report of a most
alarming nature, reached me two days ago.<eos>: 70.61065854695325
I was told, that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
_you_, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr.<eos>: 63.56219021397155
Darcy.<eos>: 5.0362465464125075
Though I
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on
setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
you."

"If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, colouring
with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far.<eos>: 37.875832788340944
What could your ladyship propose by it?"

"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."

"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth,
coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report
is in existence."

"If!<eos>: 41.57523782145863
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?<eos>: 24.284328230819497
Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves?<eos>: 25.4732981607977
Do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?"

"I never heard that it was."

"And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?"

"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.<eos>: 31.721474531186622
_You_
may ask questions, which _I_ shall not choose to answer."

"This is not to be borne.<eos>: 40.67293767015558
Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied.<eos>: 28.2978980499678
Has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"

"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."

"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason.<eos>: 38.86863664148694
But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.<eos>: 41.92700294605578
You
may have drawn him in."

"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it."

"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?<eos>: 29.364723257192708
I have not been accustomed to such
language as this.<eos>: 23.740282910452272
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."

"But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as
this, ever induce me to be explicit."

"Let me be rightly understood.<eos>: 49.655735166527975
This match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place.<eos>: 34.21639798353784
No, never.<eos>: 45.36954566873003
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy is
engaged to _my daughter_.<eos>: 16.762700830841606
Now what have you to say?"

"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me."

Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,

"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.<eos>: 42.4248401723707
From their infancy,
they have been intended for each other.<eos>: 20.56963203891334
It was the favourite wish of
_his_ mother, as well as of her's.<eos>: 35.060038473587774
While in their cradles, we planned
the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family!<eos>: 46.971954919547976
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?<eos>: 35.31265020825224
To his
tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh?<eos>: 26.120391513700383
Are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy?<eos>: 75.2462816192971
Have you not heard me say, that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"

"Yes, and I had heard it before.<eos>: 40.92818710968811
But what is that to me?<eos>: 34.37717391277144
If there is no
other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be
kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
Miss De Bourgh.<eos>: 36.32754931655938
You both did as much as you could, in planning the
marriage.<eos>: 40.65267140422163
Its completion depended on others.<eos>: 14.003569582626152
If Mr.<eos>: 2.833918965728491
Darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice?<eos>: 163.3628562182345
And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"

"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.<eos>: 58.77540348104179
Yes, Miss
Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.<eos>: 48.22662781058998
You will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him.
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us."

"These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth.<eos>: 48.014119681277016
"But the wife of Mr.
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine."

"Obstinate, headstrong girl!<eos>: 44.039129619448424
I am ashamed of you!<eos>: 19.693897283603572
Is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring?<eos>: 85.60281617982483
Is nothing due to me on that
score?

"Let us sit down.<eos>: 68.65742301805419
You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here
with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be
dissuaded from it.<eos>: 45.36809081327537
I have not been used to submit to any person's whims.
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."

"_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on _me_."

"I will not be interrupted.<eos>: 23.911451300646515
Hear me in silence.<eos>: 32.39783364715166
My daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other.<eos>: 50.200093867464965
They are descended on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient, though untitled families.<eos>: 38.00775754596919
Their fortune on both
sides is splendid.<eos>: 58.444173598194254
They are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?<eos>: 23.918329281845963
The
upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or
fortune.<eos>: 36.81817199251477
Is this to be endured!<eos>: 18.47248221636231
But it must not, shall not be.<eos>: 33.13416524983676
If you
were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere,
in which you have been brought up."

"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere.<eos>: 32.204030266348994
He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are
equal."

"True.<eos>: 50.54348968598851
You _are_ a gentleman's daughter.<eos>: 12.772026087916267
But who was your mother?<eos>: 33.919699249929664
Who
are your uncles and aunts?<eos>: 22.983595786255464
Do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition."

"Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."

"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"

Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
Catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a
moment's deliberation,

"I am not."

Lady Catherine seemed pleased.

"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"

"I will make no promise of the kind."

"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.<eos>: 46.2890142334176
I expected to find a more
reasonable young woman.<eos>: 41.79336638011588
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I
will ever recede.<eos>: 34.96874770522167
I shall not go away, till you have given me the
assurance I require."

"And I certainly _never_ shall give it.<eos>: 35.24848115759696
I am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable.<eos>: 43.87195959517123
Your ladyship wants Mr.<eos>: 19.6940562567693
Darcy to marry
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make
_their_ marriage at all more probable?<eos>: 204.2870481997954
Supposing him to be attached to
me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it
on his cousin?<eos>: 71.32479738875297
Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with
which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as
frivolous as the application was ill-judged.<eos>: 41.2143608445834
You have widely mistaken my
character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,
I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in
mine.<eos>: 62.259699206102525
I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the
subject."

"Not so hasty, if you please.<eos>: 35.30802176943071
I have by no means done.<eos>: 25.319998365650257
To all the
objections I have already urged, I have still another to add.<eos>: 71.31226283697309
I am no
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous
elopement.<eos>: 27.25417574221893
I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a
patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.<eos>: 38.558614914007066
And is
_such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister?<eos>: 31.39548881039714
Is _her_ husband, is the son of
his late father's steward, to be his brother?<eos>: 37.32945092183285
Heaven and earth!--of what
are you thinking?<eos>: 57.06362718820102
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"

"You can _now_ have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered.
"You have insulted me, in every possible method.<eos>: 40.36121025906204
I must beg to return to
the house."

And she rose as she spoke.<eos>: 40.37838817568244
Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned
back.<eos>: 40.74769885539493
Her ladyship was highly incensed.

"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
Unfeeling, selfish girl!<eos>: 48.683472822555856
Do you not consider that a connection with you,
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"

"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say.<eos>: 35.55524005496967
You know my sentiments."

"You are then resolved to have him?"

"I have said no such thing.<eos>: 34.08601803415948
I am only resolved to act in that manner,
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."

"It is well.<eos>: 35.981270198702354
You refuse, then, to oblige me.<eos>: 26.354234180136196
You refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.<eos>: 53.370368453107034
You are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."

"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any
possible claim on me, in the present instance.<eos>: 49.81826796791381
No principle of either,
would be violated by my marriage with Mr.<eos>: 27.862923348546953
Darcy.<eos>: 5.0362465464125075
And with regard to the
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's
concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn."

"And this is your real opinion!<eos>: 43.08034397267023
This is your final resolve!<eos>: 26.371259627001223
Very well.<eos>: 10.782774995419839
I
shall now know how to act.<eos>: 38.34856357856129
Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified.<eos>: 26.108900641621467
I came to try you.<eos>: 33.77538229990666
I hoped to find you
reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point."

In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of
the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,

"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.<eos>: 51.9130464691461
I send no compliments to your
mother.<eos>: 25.3633546322502
You deserve no such attention.<eos>: 41.298026110699205
I am most seriously displeased."

Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.<eos>: 37.61371376367415
She
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.<eos>: 37.663278867750364
Her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady
Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.

"She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."

"She is a very fine-looking woman!<eos>: 45.66096680991231
and her calling here was prodigiously
civil!<eos>: 79.74595844333376
for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.
She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through
Meryton, thought she might as well call on you.<eos>: 74.22695295436951
I suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"

Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.




CHAPTER XV.


The discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw
Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many
hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.<eos>: 56.008796467940996
Lady Catherine it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.
Darcy.<eos>: 52.223907536493094
It was a rational scheme to be sure!<eos>: 38.14672522907639
but from what the report of
their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,
and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply
the idea.<eos>: 84.31612513933376
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together.<eos>: 45.01379947144943
And her neighbours at
Lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the
Collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only
set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked
forward to as possible, at some future time.

In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference.<eos>: 84.25981117000777
From what she had said of her resolution to
prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate
an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared
not pronounce.<eos>: 43.75464977923945
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
address him on his weakest side.<eos>: 46.05661643622872
With his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.

If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity
unblemished could make him.<eos>: 66.32242187569292
In that case he would return no more.<eos>: 49.72188456324622
Lady
Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.

"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to
his friend within a few days," she added, "I shall know how to
understand it.<eos>: 64.24759577421761
I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of
his constancy.<eos>: 48.551502162599654
If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
at all."

       *       *       *       *       *

The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same
kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs.<eos>: 38.269026249438795
Bennet's curiosity; and
Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.

The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.

"Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room."

She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell
her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held.<eos>: 34.72367202165671
It suddenly struck her that it might
be from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations.

She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.<eos>: 32.416375988575325
He
then said,

"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly.<eos>: 56.40335125186101
As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents.<eos>: 68.05074002746271
I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink
of matrimony.<eos>: 22.111726799454907
Let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest."

The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself; when her father continued,

"You look conscious.<eos>: 46.18909901127417
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the
name of your admirer.<eos>: 38.65392367882491
This letter is from Mr.<eos>: 21.294278834686132
Collins."

"From Mr.<eos>: 9.748984882326084
Collins!<eos>: 5.563675787512131
and what can _he_ have to say?"

"Something very much to the purpose of course.<eos>: 41.15990788097182
He begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping
Lucases.<eos>: 73.73524642537446
I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says
on that point.<eos>: 46.24234185455878
What relates to yourself, is as follows.<eos>: 26.763912814774166
"Having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs.<eos>: 91.53211520831441
Collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:
of which we have been advertised by the same authority.<eos>: 65.79834231167843
Your daughter
Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after
her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate,
may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious
personages in this land."

"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?" "This young
gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive
patronage.<eos>: 63.685917864829186
Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin
Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate
closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be
inclined to take immediate advantage of."

"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?<eos>: 62.554164206641325
But now it comes out."

"My motive for cautioning you, is as follows.<eos>: 46.68102789746151
We have reason to imagine
that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with
a friendly eye."

"_Mr.<eos>: 36.112684422534194
Darcy_, you see, is the man!<eos>: 42.62186977274171
Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_
surprised you.<eos>: 28.520700705088995
Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more
effectually to what they related?<eos>: 54.1819248548857
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in
his life!<eos>: 62.98733191396205
It is admirable!"

Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile.<eos>: 30.1791629632701
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her.

"Are you not diverted?"

"Oh!<eos>: 44.595871897344225
yes.<eos>: 2.4960232358902763
Pray read on."

"After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some
family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.<eos>: 57.86808795858566
I thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned." "Mr.
Collins moreover adds," "I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally
known.<eos>: 68.11842430132928
I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married.<eos>: 48.29696248846958
It was an
encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should
very strenuously have opposed it.<eos>: 30.944089352942033
You ought certainly to forgive them as
a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names
to be mentioned in your hearing." "_That_ is his notion of christian
forgiveness!<eos>: 60.810768003095
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's
situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch.<eos>: 37.60601792413102
But, Lizzy, you
look as if you did not enjoy it.<eos>: 25.584820154552254
You are not going to be _Missish_, I
hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.<eos>: 25.684769572162256
For what do we
live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our
turn?"

"Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted.<eos>: 29.603587201725944
But it is so
strange!"

"Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing.<eos>: 32.00336190280506
Had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!<eos>: 122.63067255181724
Much as I abominate
writing, I would not give up Mr.<eos>: 28.61108121631572
Collins's correspondence for any
consideration.<eos>: 21.82402936500209
Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving
him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law.<eos>: 57.12588936119012
And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
about this report?<eos>: 65.2797368880876
Did she call to refuse her consent?"

To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
repeating it.<eos>: 69.61356195207202
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not.<eos>: 47.7969836164602
It was necessary to laugh, when she
would rather have cried.<eos>: 50.73785547754049
Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by
what he said of Mr.<eos>: 27.116141427051264
Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of
his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.




CHAPTER XVI.


Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
Elizabeth half expected Mr.<eos>: 63.96987019156593
Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy
with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's
visit.<eos>: 47.190592933449004
The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs.<eos>: 37.64685375463503
Bennet had time to
tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in
momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed
their all walking out.<eos>: 63.92658783982752
It was agreed to.<eos>: 23.44294661386876
Mrs.<eos>: 1.1478663856295606
Bennet was not in the
habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five
set off together.<eos>: 62.05381472064717
Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to
outstrip them.<eos>: 25.531569871838755
They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy,
were to entertain each other.<eos>: 54.64837023078972
Very little was said by either; Kitty was
too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.

They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon
Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when Kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone.<eos>: 78.90279219896533
Now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was
high, she immediately said,

"Mr.<eos>: 29.01404884479182
Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's.<eos>: 44.04850919190535
I
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor
sister.<eos>: 47.325675533211935
Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it.<eos>: 28.9331355673314
Were it known to the rest
of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express."

"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.<eos>: 42.41191839778337
I did not think Mrs.
Gardiner was so little to be trusted."

"You must not blame my aunt.<eos>: 29.63430253548419
Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could
not rest till I knew the particulars.<eos>: 31.395875891860783
Let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
sake of discovering them."

"If you _will_ thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone.
That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny.<eos>: 50.95885324058395
But your
_family_ owe me nothing.<eos>: 30.436218308830917
Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought
only of _you_."

Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.<eos>: 45.164029594049104
After a short pause,
her companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with me.<eos>: 33.218633123470866
If your
feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.<eos>: 57.60124165428369
_My_
affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever."

Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances.<eos>: 82.44270031933243
The
happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.<eos>: 90.04976930578641
Had Elizabeth
been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the
expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him;
but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of
feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his
affection every moment more valuable.

They walked on, without knowing in what direction.<eos>: 62.280226151558665
There was too much to
be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects.<eos>: 43.35285971637726
She
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through
London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from
her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give.<eos>: 55.59335817834197
But, unluckily for her
ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.

"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before.<eos>: 36.63793081395335
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that,
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly."

Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of
my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_.<eos>: 46.92127980840413
After abusing you so
abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations."

"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?<eos>: 26.392595059280158
For, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof.<eos>: 33.75324450006293
It was
unpardonable.<eos>: 6.466560030325608
I cannot think of it without abhorrence."

"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening," said Elizabeth.<eos>: 48.88585050220146
"The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved
in civility."

"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.<eos>: 36.2153025943783
The recollection of what I
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.<eos>: 45.94570919987995
Your
reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner.' Those were your words.<eos>: 135.1233513213336
You know not, you
can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some
time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."

"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression.<eos>: 55.112616118711976
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way."

"I can easily believe it.<eos>: 28.12175372873924
You thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, I am sure you did.<eos>: 36.38961327865623
The turn of your countenance I shall never
forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible
way, that would induce you to accept me."

"Oh!<eos>: 41.501322858004016
do not repeat what I then said.<eos>: 45.71407991841145
These recollections will not do at
all.<eos>: 36.12492791167483
I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it."

Darcy mentioned his letter.<eos>: 38.918226676659216
"Did it," said he, "did it _soon_ make you
think better of me?<eos>: 28.278326868753027
Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?"

She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her
former prejudices had been removed.

"I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary.<eos>: 56.90105291030196
I hope you have destroyed the letter.<eos>: 13.776657401340376
There was one part
especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the
power of reading again.<eos>: 55.66162240724194
I can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me."

"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily
changed as that implies."

"When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly
calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit."

"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.<eos>: 49.59092044056112
The
adieu is charity itself.<eos>: 66.65175775229311
But think no more of the letter.<eos>: 26.235047339528755
The feelings
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so
widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten.<eos>: 67.9985118833372
You must learn some
of my philosophy.<eos>: 52.97179611884092
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure."

"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.<eos>: 56.8681279667199
_Your_
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of
ignorance.<eos>: 54.83482306169779
But with _me_, it is not so.<eos>: 24.602722631330582
Painful recollections will
intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.<eos>: 40.8260466896299
I have been a
selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.<eos>: 43.88890306072869
As a
child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my
temper.<eos>: 43.72857132170499
I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride
and conceit.<eos>: 54.91579612669846
Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_)
I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
my own.<eos>: 84.06968033062645
Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might
still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth!<eos>: 77.02299661176089
What do I not
owe you!<eos>: 39.36284285643649
You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous.<eos>: 43.51249864795415
By you, I was properly humbled.<eos>: 19.917078351393837
I came to you without a
doubt of my reception.<eos>: 25.699773370704975
You shewed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."

"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"

"Indeed I had.<eos>: 79.1326865909906
What will you think of my vanity?<eos>: 24.33471315969477
I believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses."

"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you.
I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.
How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"

"Hate you!<eos>: 55.221839379436716
I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction."

"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at
Pemberley.<eos>: 53.035005254228494
You blamed me for coming?"

"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."

"Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I
confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due."

"My object _then_," replied Darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility
in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to.<eos>: 54.77652783892203
How soon any other wishes
introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an
hour after I had seen you."

He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend.

She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each, to be dwelt on farther.

After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home.

"What could become of Mr.<eos>: 63.57043538602513
Bingley and Jane!" was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs.<eos>: 65.00403174417582
Darcy was delighted with
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
it.

"I must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elizabeth.

"Not at all.<eos>: 35.24531421745555
When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."

"That is to say, you had given your permission.<eos>: 30.5441373518225
I guessed as much." And
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
the case.

"On the evening before my going to London," said he "I made a confession
to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.<eos>: 47.31694556124977
I told him of
all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs,
absurd and impertinent.<eos>: 63.32403318723261
His surprise was great.<eos>: 32.33780756754427
He had never had the
slightest suspicion.<eos>: 29.059546213203323
I told him, moreover, that I believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."

Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend.

"Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"

"From the former.<eos>: 44.83934742853467
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits
which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection."

"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him."

"It did.<eos>: 64.8156348695958
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.<eos>: 10.91957835337655
His diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his reliance on mine, made every thing easy.<eos>: 63.85681897883728
I was obliged to confess
one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.<eos>: 40.11887748537054
I could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.<eos>: 42.693920197046666
He was
angry.<eos>: 19.542820753044563
But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister's sentiments.<eos>: 37.83901674391929
He has heartily forgiven me
now."

Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr.<eos>: 37.89997961551755
Bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
herself.<eos>: 51.246428226763044
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it
was rather too early to begin.<eos>: 35.07222745746421
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley,
which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the
conversation till they reached the house.<eos>: 42.03699145279733
In the hall they parted.




CHAPTER XVII.


"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question
which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and
from all the others when they sat down to table.<eos>: 35.39007090811404
She had only to say in
reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
knowledge.<eos>: 33.82471899810806
She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.

The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary.<eos>: 54.89255721496892
The
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy,
than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
there were other evils before her.<eos>: 58.46189080973008
She anticipated what would be felt in
the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one
liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.

At night she opened her heart to Jane.<eos>: 94.96724409379796
Though suspicion was very far
from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.

"You are joking, Lizzy.<eos>: 23.46949383121049
This cannot be!--engaged to Mr.<eos>: 42.00810101573938
Darcy!<eos>: 7.10072669940854
No, no,
you shall not deceive me.<eos>: 19.24835400763396
I know it to be impossible."

"This is a wretched beginning indeed!<eos>: 27.760090567079313
My sole dependence was on you; and
I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.<eos>: 37.28636746268819
Yet, indeed, I am
in earnest.<eos>: 27.643989361249208
I speak nothing but the truth.<eos>: 41.37239993642259
He still loves me, and we are
engaged."

Jane looked at her doubtingly.<eos>: 33.88013802080473
"Oh, Lizzy!<eos>: 11.405736188287284
it cannot be.<eos>: 12.747896622761338
I know how much
you dislike him."

"You know nothing of the matter.<eos>: 27.54691614539501
_That_ is all to be forgot.<eos>: 25.45431961925874
Perhaps I
did not always love him so well as I do now.<eos>: 36.00327243534974
But in such cases as these,
a good memory is unpardonable.<eos>: 37.658041890014076
This is the last time I shall ever
remember it myself."

Miss Bennet still looked all amazement.<eos>: 80.74339738785812
Elizabeth again, and more
seriously assured her of its truth.

"Good Heaven!<eos>: 40.56310334339952
can it be really so!<eos>: 39.600019149470235
Yet now I must believe you," cried
Jane.<eos>: 28.389951545983042
"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you
certain?<eos>: 45.95237226496049
forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be
happy with him?"

"There can be no doubt of that.<eos>: 60.92896156005156
It is settled between us already, that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world.<eos>: 50.67855287801967
But are you pleased,
Jane?<eos>: 59.71602703037488
Shall you like to have such a brother?"

"Very, very much.<eos>: 40.19365510490574
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more
delight.<eos>: 119.80739089152463
But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.<eos>: 42.75475424029125
And do you
really love him quite well enough?<eos>: 66.71153641979427
Oh, Lizzy!<eos>: 11.805511669584824
do any thing rather than
marry without affection.<eos>: 98.86768812030036
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?"

"Oh, yes!<eos>: 25.0405529689806
You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I
tell you all."

"What do you mean?"

"Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley.<eos>: 34.14690610349411
I am
afraid you will be angry."

"My dearest sister, now _be_ be serious.<eos>: 27.970483092338593
I want to talk very seriously.
Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay.<eos>: 60.669683661917496
Will you tell
me how long you have loved him?"

"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at Pemberley."

Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment.<eos>: 87.47123315814875
When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
farther to wish.

"Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself.<eos>: 29.020040359574214
I
always had a value for him.<eos>: 29.241816453979897
Were it for nothing but his love of you, I
must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your
husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me.<eos>: 70.0002596050304
But
Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.<eos>: 25.747249237220753
How little did you
tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton!<eos>: 53.40672196473262
I owe all that I know
of it, to another, not to you."

Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.<eos>: 44.93506835764273
She had been unwilling to
mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend.<eos>: 31.297836879912467
But now she would no longer
conceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage.<eos>: 51.77378834516537
All was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation.

       *       *       *       *       *

"Good gracious!" cried Mrs.<eos>: 49.49138200294935
Bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, "if that disagreeable Mr.<eos>: 41.41456941709711
Darcy is not coming here again with
our dear Bingley!<eos>: 127.03310124664405
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here?<eos>: 51.25841419046891
I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company.<eos>: 37.935663054544435
What shall we do with him?
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's
way."

Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet.

As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;
and he soon afterwards said aloud, "Mr.<eos>: 51.08064920401604
Bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"

"I advise Mr.<eos>: 60.31113128927671
Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs.<eos>: 13.786335073388729
Bennet, "to walk
to Oakham Mount this morning.<eos>: 22.645188782987187
It is a nice long walk, and Mr.<eos>: 23.739694093285554
Darcy has
never seen the view."

"It may do very well for the others," replied Mr.<eos>: 29.706132808226105
Bingley; "but I am
sure it will be too much for Kitty.<eos>: 15.004075801222323
Wont it, Kitty?"

Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.<eos>: 39.75950315685742
Darcy professed a great
curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently
consented.<eos>: 25.635933998783052
As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs.<eos>: 26.222541518205777
Bennet followed her,
saying,

"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself.<eos>: 35.776747255214325
But I hope you will not mind it: it is
all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
him, except just now and then.<eos>: 41.83043621246362
So, do not put yourself to
inconvenience."

During their walk, it was resolved that Mr.<eos>: 51.34358520974461
Bennet's consent should be
asked in the course of the evening.<eos>: 22.775278656270075
Elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother's.<eos>: 23.8580312634185
She could not determine how her mother
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.<eos>: 42.38013884443113
But whether she
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to
her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr.<eos>: 54.936362763859556
Darcy should hear the
first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation.

       *       *       *       *       *

In the evening, soon after Mr.<eos>: 33.663015723144504
Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
Mr.<eos>: 15.280713846789864
Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme.<eos>: 47.266115872332364
She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_,
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched
reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr.<eos>: 44.028132108166055
Darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.<eos>: 36.60244876265861
In a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he
wants you in the library." She was gone directly.

Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
"Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing?<eos>: 44.982671615810254
Are you out of your senses, to be
accepting this man?<eos>: 36.39453320855843
Have not you always hated him?"

How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate!<eos>: 83.84529875088366
It would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of
her attachment to Mr.<eos>: 40.915253553162486
Darcy.

"Or in other words, you are determined to have him.<eos>: 43.13678844680423
He is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.
But will they make you happy?"

"Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my
indifference?"

"None at all.<eos>: 60.41286090155885
We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
this would be nothing if you really liked him."

"I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him.
Indeed he has no improper pride.<eos>: 39.934749816763855
He is perfectly amiable.<eos>: 26.59149342728347
You do not
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms."

"Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent.<eos>: 31.431538868976418
He is the kind
of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he
condescended to ask.<eos>: 38.12541731226879
I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him.<eos>: 38.42837069709302
But let me advise you to think better of it.<eos>: 27.79637714088118
I know your
disposition, Lizzy.<eos>: 23.752149968126734
I know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
up to him as a superior.<eos>: 85.82045827069163
Your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage.<eos>: 96.6888447440612
You could scarcely escape
discredit and misery.<eos>: 47.67014372867319
My child, let me not have the grief of seeing
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life.<eos>: 55.31546029673149
You know not what you are
about."

Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;
and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr.<eos>: 56.38139178947889
Darcy was really the
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many
months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she
did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.

"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to
say.<eos>: 34.80297826986381
If this be the case, he deserves you.<eos>: 38.04934756913854
I could not have parted with
you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy."

To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr.<eos>: 67.29883741324448
Darcy
had voluntarily done for Lydia.<eos>: 44.19620604856549
He heard her with astonishment.

"This is an evening of wonders, indeed!<eos>: 36.68086407200142
And so, Darcy did every thing;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him
his commission!<eos>: 90.25747155484474
So much the better.<eos>: 33.78797213288776
It will save me a world of trouble
and economy.<eos>: 64.51452695190599
Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have
paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
way.<eos>: 70.12835164355701
I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."

He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
Mr.<eos>: 43.83677647054676
Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "If any young men come
for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."

Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure.<eos>: 49.27259866402033
Every thing was too recent for
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any
thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.

When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
and made the important communication.<eos>: 51.333343017625914
Its effect was most
extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs.<eos>: 75.4271310064996
Bennet sat quite still, and
unable to utter a syllable.<eos>: 39.583865856948314
Nor was it under many, many minutes, that
she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to
credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the
shape of a lover to any of them.<eos>: 56.64467700424603
She began at length to recover, to
fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless
herself.

"Good gracious!<eos>: 52.69506513245703
Lord bless me!<eos>: 26.239724770654632
only think!<eos>: 28.4589975742663
dear me!<eos>: 20.467729847316072
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy!<eos>: 7.10072669940854
Who would
have thought it!<eos>: 22.012884442523
And is it really true?<eos>: 96.03428889997788
Oh!<eos>: 4.7344512948191735
my sweetest Lizzy!<eos>: 15.25030720623966
how rich
and how great you will be!<eos>: 105.60131562587857
What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have!<eos>: 50.60154511075863
Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all.<eos>: 56.35491559639362
I am so
pleased--so happy.<eos>: 44.574235647054685
Such a charming man!--so handsome!<eos>: 63.23568713936022
so tall!--Oh, my
dear Lizzy!<eos>: 21.046654256361403
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.<eos>: 25.542070625542422
I
hope he will overlook it.<eos>: 11.052015124705767
Dear, dear Lizzy.<eos>: 24.694861422574693
A house in town!<eos>: 26.54286331963964
Every thing
that is charming!<eos>: 67.08949267321468
Three daughters married!<eos>: 34.91351462955101
Ten thousand a year!<eos>: 34.594503603208466
Oh,
Lord!<eos>: 11.029733937971429
What will become of me.<eos>: 15.923120901395206
I shall go distracted."

This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and
Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
soon went away.<eos>: 57.928220620689586
But before she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her.

"My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else!<eos>: 25.184015639505652
Ten
thousand a year, and very likely more!<eos>: 53.423057473037424
'Tis as good as a Lord!<eos>: 28.65113424724433
And a
special licence.<eos>: 7.049077196973629
You must and shall be married by a special licence.<eos>: 35.30913984957164
But
my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr.<eos>: 82.61617721497399
Darcy is particularly fond of,
that I may have it to-morrow."

This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'
consent, there was still something to be wished for.<eos>: 43.35970526236762
But the morrow
passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs.<eos>: 47.344010275807854
Bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak
to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark
her deference for his opinion.

Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and Mr.<eos>: 45.059308109500705
Bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem.

"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he.<eos>: 66.68000199962276
"Wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well
as Jane's."




CHAPTER XVIII.


Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.
Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.<eos>: 40.825837242058384
"How could
you begin?" said she.<eos>: 21.03276724837813
"I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?"

"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation.<eos>: 52.90850797050362
It is too long ago.<eos>: 21.640200958439593
I was in the middle before I
knew that I _had_ begun."

"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.<eos>: 57.99040140498486
Now be sincere;
did you admire me for my impertinence?"

"For the liveliness of your mind, I did."

"You may as well call it impertinence at once.<eos>: 61.92446673400069
It was very little less.
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention.<eos>: 52.83554384261616
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone.<eos>: 85.75175257905634
I roused, and
interested you, because I was so unlike _them_.<eos>: 42.04702908213508
Had you not been really
amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you.<eos>: 51.31588443845246
There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;
and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
reasonable.<eos>: 45.00552475838145
To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
of _that_ when they fall in love."

"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was
ill at Netherfield?"

"Dearest Jane!<eos>: 62.471767539298476
who could have done less for her?<eos>: 40.82032814287364
But make a virtue of it
by all means.<eos>: 41.23735715489781
My good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last.<eos>: 56.92718132177277
What made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here?<eos>: 49.53414486502581
Why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?"

"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."

"But I was embarrassed."

"And so was I."

"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."

"A man who had felt less, might."

"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
I should be so reasonable as to admit it!<eos>: 54.474597225653014
But I wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.<eos>: 49.24714031160236
I wonder when
you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you!<eos>: 49.794578620134345
My resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.<eos>: 85.32513682188488
_Too
much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the
subject?<eos>: 43.089262018389576
This will never do."

"You need not distress yourself.<eos>: 36.214884309879956
The moral will be perfectly fair.<eos>: 36.79078178211951
Lady
Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of
removing all my doubts.<eos>: 34.87486176337771
I am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.<eos>: 84.36416524343099
I was not in a humour to
wait for any opening of your's.<eos>: 39.03303313504901
My aunt's intelligence had given me
hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing."

"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use.<eos>: 40.59876500857692
But tell me, what did you come down to
Netherfield for?<eos>: 31.953441495455444
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?
or had you intended any more serious consequence?"

"My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I
might ever hope to make you love me.<eos>: 68.48141155612247
My avowed one, or what I avowed to
myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,
and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made."

"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine, what is to
befall her?"

"I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth.<eos>: 49.77855834873983
But it ought to
be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done
directly."

"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.<eos>: 37.850646740968166
But
I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."

From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr.<eos>: 60.63987991903311
Darcy
had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs.<eos>: 42.629613802538515
Gardiner's
long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:

     "I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have
     done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but
     to say the truth, I was too cross to write.<eos>: 51.56296479731622
You supposed more than
     really existed.<eos>: 40.69539527314089
But _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a
     loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible
     flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me
     actually married, you cannot greatly err.<eos>: 77.62365398920137
You must write again very
     soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.<eos>: 61.169511754906175
I
     thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes.<eos>: 45.977779691108054
How could I
     be so silly as to wish it!<eos>: 38.960985006984934
Your idea of the ponies is delightful.
     We will go round the Park every day.<eos>: 71.17803851342543
I am the happiest creature in
     the world.<eos>: 15.091498827181413
Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one
     with such justice.<eos>: 73.82113042228104
I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I
     laugh.<eos>: 79.17462920816575
Mr.<eos>: 1.1372347791202562
Darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can
     spare from me.<eos>: 41.947020240621875
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.

     Your's, &c."

Mr.<eos>: 48.66820094834261
Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine, was in a different style; and
still different from either, was what Mr.<eos>: 36.72792514207645
Bennet sent to Mr.<eos>: 9.944515076547916
Collins, in
reply to his last.

     "DEAR SIR,

     "I must trouble you once more for congratulations.<eos>: 53.4119617857685
Elizabeth will
     soon be the wife of Mr.<eos>: 26.324403957990025
Darcy.<eos>: 5.0362465464125075
Console Lady Catherine as well as
     you can.<eos>: 32.67926658957238
But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew.<eos>: 42.48999865763298
He has
     more to give.

     "Your's sincerely, &c."

Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere.<eos>: 40.195816772148255
She wrote even
to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her
former professions of regard.<eos>: 49.57110729937871
Jane was not deceived, but she was
affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.

The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was
as sincere as her brother's in sending it.<eos>: 64.0350112895124
Four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister.

Before any answer could arrive from Mr.<eos>: 62.47621785772842
Collins, or any congratulations
to Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the
Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge.<eos>: 60.85703320765831
The reason of this sudden
removal was soon evident.<eos>: 67.07254718757672
Lady Catherine had been rendered so
exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that
Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over.<eos>: 35.989734460104394
At such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw Mr.<eos>: 42.92922044488663
Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her
husband.<eos>: 16.90249641400955
He bore it however with admirable calmness.<eos>: 32.872378962461944
He could even
listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at St.<eos>: 43.15411363966121
James's, with very decent composure.<eos>: 22.560406422524053
If he did
shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.

Mrs.<eos>: 20.00704730146679
Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his
forbearance; and though Mrs.<eos>: 43.610711471645516
Philips, as well as her sister, stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.
Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all
likely to make her more elegant.<eos>: 54.08557088220403
Elizabeth did all she could, to shield
him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him
to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it
added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to
either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
Pemberley.




CHAPTER XIX.


Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs.<eos>: 57.12419606694502
Bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters.<eos>: 41.71956886191497
With what delighted pride she
afterwards visited Mrs.<eos>: 83.23242625780728
Bingley and talked of Mrs.<eos>: 13.309725146429262
Darcy may be guessed.
I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment
of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children,
produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,
well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was
lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in
so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly.

Mr.<eos>: 59.763400862158164
Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do.<eos>: 84.95102506855773
He delighted in
going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.

Mr.<eos>: 48.87403742729608
Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.<eos>: 40.60610631035045
So near
a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.<eos>: 125.57033732526402
The darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.

Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters.<eos>: 66.32354804347355
In society so superior to what she had generally
known, her improvement was great.<eos>: 67.92434823965847
She was not of so ungovernable a
temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she
became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
ignorant, and less insipid.<eos>: 44.69351475782547
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's
society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs.<eos>: 41.587847561191396
Wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.

Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs.<eos>: 64.68956185058614
Bennet's being quite
unable to sit alone.<eos>: 32.183107478019615
Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance.

As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters.<eos>: 50.48241637591573
He bore with philosophy the conviction that
Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every
thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on
to make his fortune.<eos>: 67.4807775321146
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received
from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,
if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.<eos>: 61.365453993423365
The letter was to this
effect:

     "MY DEAR LIZZY,

     "I wish you joy.<eos>: 29.188456295545866
If you love Mr.<eos>: 15.455396533676756
Darcy half as well as I do my dear
     Wickham, you must be very happy.<eos>: 33.70286427749969
It is a great comfort to have you
     so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will
     think of us.<eos>: 30.799819038272613
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very
     much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live
     upon without some help.<eos>: 56.668370542420334
Any place would do, of about three or four
     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr.<eos>: 44.46166602900042
Darcy about it,
     if you had rather not.

     "Yours, &c."

As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
frequently sent them.<eos>: 59.05558689851769
It had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or
herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills.<eos>: 74.41368742343086
Their manner of living, even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme.<eos>: 35.36991649659702
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation, and always spending more than they ought.<eos>: 59.84049186438739
His affection for
her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in
spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her.

Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for
Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.<eos>: 44.088244339895695
Lydia was
occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he
proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.

Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she
dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as
attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
to Elizabeth.

Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.<eos>: 61.520293074145115
They were able to love each
other, even as well as they intended.<eos>: 42.167766189065134
Georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an
astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of
talking to her brother.<eos>: 56.42105107908496
He, who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
pleasantry.<eos>: 41.15803938618064
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
her way.<eos>: 66.92495832647167
By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a
woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.

Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end.<eos>: 54.54930156020225
But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on
them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.

With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.<eos>: 43.64945612970222
Darcy,
as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S.<eos>: 37.11388053328485
Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.<eos>: 37.08738535006855
For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.<eos>: 119.97266242473852
Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.<eos>: 135.93938626529965
